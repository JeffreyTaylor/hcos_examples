# hcOS

hcOS (“Healthcare Operating System”) is a web-based software platform under development at UPMC. Its purpose is to make it easy for app developers to build software solutions that access clinical data and clinical systems. Using hcOS, you can build a healthcare application, for clinicians or consumers or administrators, that reads and processes clinical data.  

## hcOS Examnples

hcOS Examples is a collection of code examples and documentation to help you get started using the APIs quickly. The examples are owned and maintained by the hcOS Developer Experience (DX) team.

## hcOS Developer Experience (DX) Team

The hcOS Developer Experience (DX) Team focuses on designing APIs, building tools, and writing code examples that accelerate time to first Hello World and reduce the time to build hcOS applications.

## Samples

### [Getting Started](./getting_started)

The [Getting Started](./getting_started) guide is the quickest and easiest way to get from zero to first-hello-world in a matter of minutes. In this guide you'll learn how to issue and sign hcOS Search API and hcOS Document API requests as well as process both search and document results.

### Patient Viewer (Coming soon...)

The Patient Viewer (Coming soon...) guide will show you how to retieve and display all hcOS data elements for a single patient. This guide will be useful for building patient centric applications. 

## Data

[PatientDocument.bulk.json](./data/PatientDocument.bulk.json) containing 1000 Mimic PatientDocuments has been provided.

A [folder](./data/text) been provided with extracted MIMIC text reports.  This should help you create search queries of your own to test hcOS search capabilities against our MIMIC tenant.
