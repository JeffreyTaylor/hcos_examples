Admission Date:  2007-10-05 00:00:00       Discharge Date:  2007-10-05 00:00:00

Date of Birth: 1986-10-02 00:00:00 00:00:00       Sex:  M

Service:  COLORECTAL

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
1.  End-stage renal disease.
2.  Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Severe colitis.
4.  Fatal arrhythmia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 54 year old
male with end-stage renal disease secondary to
post-Streptococcal glomerular nephritis and CPDD, and adrenal
insufficiency, who presented with two to three weeks of lower
abdominal pain and was found to be Clostridium difficile
positive.  Upon work-up the patient showed worsening
abdominal CT scan consistent with pan-colitis.

The patient was initially treated with Vancomycin
intravenously with p.o. Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.  On
2007-10-05 00:00:00, the patient was found to be gasping for air while
on 100% non-rebreather mask with an arterial blood gases of
7.04, 80, 43.  The patient was immediately intubated and
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at which time
the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with heart
rate between 100 to 140.  Rate was very difficult to control
and Diltiazem drip was initiated.

On 2007-10-05 00:00:00, the patient's heart rate remained
between 90 to 110 with Diltiazem drip at 10 mg per hour and
blood pressure was also difficult to maintain.  The patient
responded well initially to boluses with decrease in
tachycardia, however, due to the worsening pan-colitis, the
patient was taken back to the Operating Room for a subtotal
colectomy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  N/A.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 55 year old
male status post subtotal colectomy and end-ileostomy for
infarcted small intestine and colitis with pseudomembranes.
The patient was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics with
cultures sent.  The patient's CT scan of the abdomen
indicated a diffuse thickening of terminal ileum and large
intestine to the transverse colon without stranding.

A repeat CT scan immediately prior to the subtotal colectomy
indicated pan-colitis which progressed from prior scan but no
evidence of perforation.

Immediately postoperatively, the patient continued to have
respiratory distress requiring increased pressor support and
required continued transfusion with seven units both of P,
two units of packed red blood cells and four liters of
Crystalloid.

Despite the continued resuscitation, the patient remained
hypotensive with continued lactic acidosis requiring
bicarbonate replacement.  The aggressive resuscitation
continued until 2007-10-05 00:00:00, when after a long
discussion with the family members, the patient was made
comfort measures only.

The patient developed a ventricular fibrillation shortly
thereafter and expired later on that evening.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post subtotal colectomy and
ileostomy.

DISPOSITION:   Death.
