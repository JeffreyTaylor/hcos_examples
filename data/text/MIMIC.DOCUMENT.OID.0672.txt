History of Present Illness:
84M h/o COPD, dCHF, AF, AS valve area 0.7, s/p superior
segmentectomy of right lower lobe 2014-08-07 00:00:00, c/o dyspnea and cough.
.
He was seen initially at UPMCE hospital where sats noted as
high 80s-low 90s on 3L with borderline trop (0.08 which is
UPMCE reference cutoff). BNP there 734 by report. CXR
there also showed pna, but he was not treated there. Given trop,
cards at OSH was called however defferred cath since INR 3.5.
Patient was given aspirin, steroids, and Lasix 40mg (approx 5
hours PTA here).  Also had CT head/cspine (both negative) for
fall 1 week ago.
.
On arrival to the ED at UPMCE, VS were: 98.6, 76, 107/57, 16,
hypoxic in the mid 80s on 3 L, but mentating very well and says
he feels relatively well. Lungs had  minimal crackles at
bilateral bases.
.
Creatinine 1.2 (baseline 0.9-1.0).  CBC 8.5 95% N/37.8/312.  UA
was negative.  ABG was 7.38/33/132 on NRB 100%.  Lactate 1.5.
INR 3.6. Trop was 0.07. CXR consistent with pneumonia.  ED
resident thinks no ST changes on EKG.  Blood cultures were sent.
Patient was discussed with Dr. Hosier who agrees that this may be
pneumonia and demand and recommends diuresis and that he may
need cath if does not improve medically.  He was given
Levofloxacin 750mg before transfer to ICU.
.
VS on transfer: afebrile (99), 71, 117/70s, mid 20s, 98% on NRB.
 BP low to mid 90s when arrived per ED resident.  Access is 2
18G IV. Tried titrating down on oxygen a couple of hours ago and
did not tolerate it.
.
On the floor, history is obtained from the patient and his son.
They state that since his wife's passing on 2014-08-07 00:00:00 he has not been
doing well but denies dyspnea or CP during that time. His
daughter moved from Beasley Hosier and has been living with him and
helping with his medications.  He has not missed any medications
nor had any changes except an antidepressant. Patient did have a
fall 2014-08-07 00:00:00 when he had been drinking wine and fell over a dining
room chair after he tripped. He was evaluated in the ED the next
day and had neg CT scans.   Day prior to admission he was doing
well, did yard work and then took 3 cans of prune juice because
of constipation. (Children report he takes a lot of OTC stool
meds.) He then had multiple unknown number of episodes of
diarrhea yesterday and last night. No fevers or chills, no
cough. His son states that the patient told him that he awoke at
4am with pain up and down his epigastrum which resolved. No back
pain.  He then went back to bed and his son found him this
morning at 8:30am sitting in a chair and pale. He was unsteady
and not very responsive.  No history of stroke or CVA.
Currently, he states that he feels much improved though has been
dyspneic for the past day since doing the yardwork.  No chest
pain at all.  No swelling. + Cough, no sputum. Home sat is
90-91% without home oxygen need.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON 2014-08-07 00:00:00

Comparison with a CT chest from 2014-08-07 00:00:00 as well as a chest
radiograph from
2014-08-07 00:00:00.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Hypoxia, question acute process in the chest.

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.
Slight increase
in vague opacities involving the mid-to-lower lungs are
increased from the
prior radiograph and could reflect underpenetration and poor
technique, though
the possibility of pneumonia is difficult to exclude. Suture
material in the
right perihilar region is unchanged. No large pleural effusion
is seen.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax. Bony
structures are
grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Limited study with subtle increased opacity
involving the
mid-to-lower lungs bilaterally, may reflect pneumonia. Consider
more
optimized technique with dedicated PA and lateral views to more
clearly and
thoroughly assess.

Approved: WED 2014-08-07 00:00:00 2:27 PM

TTE 2014-08-07 00:00:00
The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%) with possible mild inferolateral hypokinesis.
Cannot exclude other focal wall motion abnormality due to
suboptimal views. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is probably severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2); estimation limited by
suboptimal left ventricular outflow tract Doppler recordings and
uncertainty in measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract
diameter. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen but may be
underestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2014-08-07 00:00:00,
the aortic valve gradient is similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Hosier is an 84 year old man with history of COPD, dCHF,
AF, Aortic Stenosis valve area 0.7, s/p superior segmentectomy
of right lower lobe 2014-08-07 00:00:00, transfered from OSH with very mild
troponin elevation, transfered to UPMCE for cardiac evaluation,
admitted to the MICU with pneumonia and heart failure.

# Community Acquired Pneumonia
Patient was noted to have RML and retrocardiac opacities on CXR.
 He was started on levofloxacin for pneumonia, transitioned to
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED, then transitioned back
to levofloxacin on the floor for treatment course of 7 days
total antibiotics, finished during hospitalization.  Legionella
urinary antigen negative.  On discharge, satting 89% on room air
and 95% on 3L nasal cannula.  Ambulatory sats were 85% on RA,
improved with 2L nasal canula.  Pt was discharged on home
oxygen.

# Acute on Chronic dCHF:
Baseline weight of 214 lbs per son.  Beasley Hosier was felt to be in acute
on chronic heart failure in the MICU where he was given IV lasix
as needed for diuresis.  He takes furosemide 40mg UPMCE at
baseline.  Patient was discharged on furosemide 40mg every Other
day in setting of elevated bicarbonate and limited fluid buildup
after two days of holding diuretics, felt to have contraction
alkalosis.  Pt's daughter was advised to call if weight
increasing by 3 lbs. Followup appointment with PCP next week.

# COPD Exacerbation
Patient was treated 5 day 123 Any St.one burst. Given nebulizers.

# Troponin elevation:
Very mild troponin elevation to 0.08 at OSH, normalized on
admission, likely secondary to demand ischemia. No EKG changes
to suggest active ischemia.  Most likely became hypovolemic,
possible with poor foward flow in setting of AS, and had demand
episode.  He was changed back to ASA 81 (from 325 initiatially)
and Atorvastatin 10mg (from 80mg initially).

# Diarrhea:
Resolved on admission. Most likely due to prune juice/oral
medications including miralax per daughter.

# Delirium:
Patient with episodes of delirium overnight during
hospitalization, likely in setting of infection and ICU stay,
improved by time of discharge.

# Acute grieving/depression:
Patient recovering from recent loss of wife (2014-08-07 00:00:00). Spent
time with pastoral care and social work and recommend follow-up
with Beasley Hosier psych as outpatient.

# Hypothyroidism
TSH elevated to 21 with low Free T4 0.04. This level of
elevation unlikely to only be secondary to acute illness, so low
dose levothyroxine started at 25mcg daily.  Pt will require
repeat TSH in 6wks as outpatient.  Hypothyroidism may contribute
to functional decline over last couple of months and depressive
symptoms.

# Acute renal insufficiency
Discharged with creatinine of 1.2.  Decreased furosemide dose to
40mg every other day from 40mg UPMCE, until followup by PCP.

# Atrial fibrillation
Currently in NSR. Initially held coumadin because of elevated
INR, then restarted.  Warfarin should be continued at 2.5mg
daily for 2 more days then decreased to half tab (1.25mg), then
back to home dosing of alternating 2.5mg and 1.25mg.  Patient's
primary care physician office was notified.  INR on discharge
was 1.8. INR will be redrawn by PCP's office on Friday 2014-08-07 00:00:00.
Continued amiodarone.

# BPH:
Continued finasteride, held terazosin given BP effects.
Terazosin may be restarted and uptitrated back to home dose by
PCP.

==============================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- TSH will need to be rechecked in 6 weeks as an outpatient
(started on 25 mcg of levothyroxine because of elevated TSH and
low Free T4)
- 2014-08-07 00:00:00 need Beasley Hosier psych consult
- INR to be drawn 2014-08-07 00:00:00, followed up by PCP
Beasley Hosier Beasley Hosier will follow daily weights
- PCP to recheck lytes at next visit and uptitrate the
furosemide as necessary
- PCP to consider restarting terazosin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Hosier,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have
a pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and had extra fluid.

You first came to UPMCE, which transferred you to
UPMCE, where you stayed in the intensive care unit for one
night and then moved to the medical floor. Here, you continued
to receive antibiotics and steroids and your breathing improved.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Please STOP your spironolactone for now.
- Please DECREASE your furosemide to 40 mg once EVERY OTHER day
until you see your primary care doctor.  In the meantime, please
check your weight daily at home and call your doctor if your
weight increased by more than 3 lbs.
- Please START Levothyroxine 25mcg daily
- Please STOP your terazosin for now.  This medication may be
slowly restarted by your primary care doctor.
- Continue your warfarin at 2.5 mg for 2 more days (Wednesday
2014-08-07 00:00:00 and Thursday 2014-08-07 00:00:00) and then return to your normal dose of
2.5mg (1 tab) every other day and 1.25 (2014-08-07 00:00:00 tab) on the other
