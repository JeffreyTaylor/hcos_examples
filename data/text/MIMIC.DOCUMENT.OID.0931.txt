Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Alassane Rabenau
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-VT ablation

History of Present Illness:
This morning, the patient was having breakfast when he heard a
loud, banging noise and dropped his cup of tea. This episode was
not accompanied by any other symptoms. The patient denied any
chest pain. His baseline does involve symptoms of exertional
dyspnea with moderate physical activity, but no symptoms of
dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (he
consistently sleeps on two pillows), or lower extremity edema.
He has not had any episodes of dizziness or syncope.
.
The patient reported for a routine ICD outpatient check and was
discovered to be in sustained ventricular tachycardia at about
160-170 beats per minute. The patient's son was told that the 4
shocks in the recent past; however, the patient's symptoms of
hearing a loud, banging noise only matched up to a single shock.
(The patient received a shock during his stay at UPMCE; he
reported hearing a loud noise then as well.) The patient went to
UPMCE Hospital briefly and was then transfered here for
ablation.

On review of systems, he denies any recent headache, dizziness,
dysphagia, cough, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, constipation,
diarrhea. The patient has had no change in a123 Any St.e and has been
able to consume his usual amounts of food and liquid.

Groin Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of a right groin pseudoaneurysm or AV
fistula.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 YO man with history of CAD, CABG, and Ischemic cardiomyopathy
s/p pacer ICD placement presenting to UPMCE with episode of VT
and subsequent pacer firing.

Ventricular tachycardia: Patient was taken to the EP lab and
found to have an arrhythmogenic focus in the Left ventricle.
Ablation was performed and the patient was returned to the
floor. Overnight he was noted to have multiple 10-15 beat runs
of slow NS VT. EP was consulted and they felt this was secondary
to radiofrequency ablation. His Generator was changed on
hospital day two. He was discharged on 400 mg of Amiodarone
twice a day for two weeks to be switched to 400 mg once a day
from then on. The patient was noted to have a femoral bruit
following his procedure. An US did not show any evidence of
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. He ambulated independently on the
day of discharge. He will follow up with Dr. Ticknor at
UPMCE on 2008-09-19 00:00:00.

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY: Ventricular Tachycardia
SECONDARY: Ischemic Cardiomyopathy


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure being involved in your care, Mr. Ticknor. You
came to the hospital with  ventricular tachycardia (a fast
abnormal heart rate) that caused your ICD (intracardiac
defibrillator) to fire. Because of this you were taken to the
electrophysiology lab and underwent an ablation (burning of the
electrical circuits of the heart to try to control the abnormal
rhythm) as well as a generator change for your ICD.

Your medications have changed as follows:
1) START taking Amiodarone 400mg twice a day for two weeks.
After that you should take 400mg Amiodarone once a day.

2) START Keflex three times a day for 5 days.

You should continue taking your other medications as prescribed.

Weigh yourself every morning, Donnamae Ticknor MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with Dr. Ticknor at UPMCE.
An appointment has been made for you on Wednesday 2008-09-19 00:00:00
at 3:20pm.   The phone number is test@mail.com in case you need
to make changes.
