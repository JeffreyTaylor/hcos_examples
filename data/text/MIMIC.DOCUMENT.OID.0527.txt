Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Lorenzia Richason
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Ivanov is a 68 year-old man with IgA meyloma s/p Velcade
(last treatment 2013-02-04 00:00:00), DM2, CKD, and schizophrenia who
presents from his UPMCE with confusion and is admitted
to the MICU for sepsis/hypotension.
.
He was in his USOH until three days ago when nursing staff
noticed that he was more confused. Today, he was noted by staff
to have high finger sticks (glucose > 500), urinary
incontinence, and to be more confused, with waxing and Lorenzia Richason
mental status. He was given 22 units insulin and had a BP of
86/51. Per report, he had no fever, cough, headache, nausea, or
emesis.
.
-------
Upon Transfer to the Floors:
For full HPI, please refer to MICU H and P. Briefly, the patient
is a 68 YO M with IgA MM, IDDM, CKD and schizophrenia admitted
to the MICU on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 for hypotension in the setting of altered
mental status. He was found to have high-grade GNR bacteremia. A
R IJ was placed and he was fluid resucitated. Her initially
required norepinephrine for pressure support but was weaned off
of presssors on 2013-02-04 00:00:00. He was started on vanc and cefepime
pending culture results. Vanc was stopped on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 and he remains
on cefepime. Sensitivities have just returned and the GNR
appears to be sensitive to cipro.
.
The patient's ICU stay was complicated by rising creatinine,
currently 4.4, from a baseline of 1.5. He has been seen by
renal. Urine sediment revealed muddy Ivanov casts consistent with
ATN. As of the day of transfer, his urine output has increased
to almost 4L in the past 24 hours. He has gotten 1L of fluids
with bicarb as per renal suggestion due to low bicarb in the
setting of ATN.
.
He has also been hyperglycemic requiring close glucose
monitoring.
.
He reports feeling much improved and has no specific complaints
at this time. He denies pain. His voice is difficult to
understand and he reports being tired of everyone repeatedly
examining him, making the interview somewhat limited.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; unable to obtain a full ROS. As above, he denies
pain including dysuria prior to presentation. He does state he
knew he was sick but is not able to elaborate on his specific
symptoms. He says he's "all fixed up down there now."

In the ED, vital signs were initially: 100.3 99 93/51 16 99. A
CXR was negative for pna and a head CT was limited by motion but
123 Any St. negative. A UA was grossly positive and he was given
vanc/ceftriaxone. SBPs drop to the 80s and he was given 5L IVF.
A RIJ was placed with a CVP of 8, and he was also started on
levophed and an insulin drip. He was then admitted to the MICU
for further management.
.
On arrival to the floor, he is comfortable, A/O x 3, and
requesting to return to his UPMCE center.


Past Medical History:
1. IgA multiple myeloma. He is status post multiple cycles of
Velcade. His course has been complicated by renal failure.
2. Chronic Renal Failure. Likely related to his MM.
3. Type 2 diabetes
3. Schizophrenia, managed by psychiatry, seen by Dr. Ivanov and
receives Haldol Depo every month.
4. Hyperlipidemia

Imaging:
CXR 2013-02-04 00:00:00
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are mildly diminished. Similar to the
prior exam,
there is slight accentuation of the interstitial markings.
Bibasilar
atelectasis is evident. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The
cardiac
silhouette is within normal limits for size. No effusion or
pneumothorax is noted. Please note the patient's chin obscures
the extreme right apex. The osseous structures again reveal
vertebral body height loss in multiple
thoracic vertebral body segments.

IMPRESSION: Relatively stable examination with bibasilar
atelectasis. No
definite consolidation noted.

CT head
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly limited study due to patient motion. No gross
interval change
from prior without evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage.
Evaluation for infarction is limited on this motion-limited
study, and MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia
(for which the patient would require sedation in order to
obtain).
2. Mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.

Renal U/S
IMPRESSION: No renal abscess or perinephric collection. Please
note that
pyelonephritis cannot be diagnosed on ultrasound.

CXR 2013-02-04 00:00:00:
New opacification in both lower lungs could be pneumonia.
Pleural effusions if any are small. Upper lungs clear. Heart
size is normal. Right jugular line ends at the superior
cavoatrial junction. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3047**] Ivanov was paged


Brief Hospital Course:
68 YO M with IgA MM, IDDM2, CKD, and schizophrenia admitted to
the MICU with AMS and hypotension found to have urosepsis and
ATN.
.
# Urosepsis: Pt found to have high-grade E.coli bacteremia. A R
IJ was placed and he was fluid resucitated. He initially
required norepinephrine for pressure support but was weaned off
of presssors on 2013-02-04 00:00:00. He was started on vanc and cefepime
pending culture results. Vanc was stopped on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 and he remained
on cefepime until 2013-02-04 00:00:00. When sensitivities returned, found that
e. coli sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and patient switched to
Cipro. He had no other complications, no evidence of abscess on
renal U/S. Prostate exam benign (no tenderness on exam),
scheduled for urology follow-up as outpatient.
He was last febrile on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 and levaquin was started for possible
b/l PNA on CXR (though no  hypoxia or respiratory complaints).
No aspiration on S&S. Possible he aspirated when he was altered
and came in. R IJ removed, but contaminated and could not be
sent for cx.  Switched cipro to levaquin on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 for treatment of
PNA in addition to urosepsis. Will need total of two week course
for treatment of urosepsis (will end on 2013-02-04 00:00:00). Currently
dosed at levaquin 250mg Q48 in light of renal failure.  Final
blood and urine cultures must be followed up after discharge
(last positive blood cx on 2013-02-04 00:00:00).

.
# Acute kidney injury 2013-02-04 00:00:00 ATN. The patient's ICU stay was
complicated by rising creatinine, which peaked to 4.6, from a
baseline of 1.5. He was seen by renal. Urine sediment revealed
muddy Ivanov casts consistent with ATN. He was maintained on IVF
but made excellent urine output of 4L for each of the 3 days
prior to discharge, illustrating post-ATN diuresis. His
creatinine trended down to 3.9 on the day of discharge. Has
follow-up with Dr. Britnye as outpatient.

.
# Hyperglycemia/Diabetes. History of poorly controlled finger
sticks now exacerbated in setting of infection. No urine
ketones.  Lantus increased from 36units to 40 units and sliding
scale added. He only has VNA twice a day (patient refused to go
to rehab), so will only get BS check twice a day. Glipizide
titrated down to UPMCE dosing instead of TID dosing, adjusted for
renal failure.

.
# IgA multiple myeloma. Status post multiple cycles of Velcade
with last treatment on 2013-02-04 00:00:00.  Patient of Dr. Lorenzia Richason. NP
notified that patient being discharged and will call patient for
appointment in late 2013-02-04 00:00:00. Continued acyclovir 400 UPMCE.

.
# Anemia. Slightly down from baseline of 31-34. Likely related
to acute inflammation in the setting of chronic iron def anemia
as well as myeloma. Guaiac positive and scheduled for GI
follow-up w/ Dr. Lorenzia Richason as outpatient.

.
# Thrombocytopenia. Platelets trended down but stable throughout
hospitalization. Platelets of 134 on discharge and were trending
up at that point. CBC should be checked as outpatient, and
further management as per heme-onc team.
.
# Schizophrenia: Managed by psychiatry, seen by Dr. Ivanov and
receives Haldol Depo every month.
.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO PATIENT THAT HE GO TO REHABILITATION
FACILITY FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY. PATIENT REFUSED, AND WILL HAVE
HOME PT.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 because you were
confused. We found that you had a severe infection of your
bladder and your blood. You were in the intensive care unit for
this and you had kidney failure as a result of your infection.
Your kidney failure is improving. You were started on
antibiotics and you will need to continue levaquin until 2013-02-04 00:00:00
for your infection.

Since it is unusual for men to have urinary tract infections,
please follow up with urology as listed below.

You MUST DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS for your kidney failure. Drink
at least 8 glasses of water a day.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
1. Increase lantus from 36 units to 40 units in the morning
2. Start the humalog sliding scale attached
3. Decrease glipizide from 5mg three times a day to 5mg twice a
day.

It was our recommendation that you go to a rehabilitation
