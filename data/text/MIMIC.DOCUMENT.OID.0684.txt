CT head 2006-08-09 00:00:00
1. Acute small bifrontal subdural hematomas with small amounts
of adjacent
subarachnoid blood.
2. Non-displaced left superior frontal fracture extending to the
sagittal
suture at the vertex, with overlying subgaleal hematoma.
3. This patient had 32 prior head CTs since 2006-08-09 00:00:00, and 9
additional prior
head CTs between 2006-08-09 00:00:00 and 2006-08-09 00:00:00.

CT C-spine 2006-08-09 00:00:00
1. No acute fracture or subluxation.
2. Unchanged chronic dens fracture and posterior fusion of
C1-C3, without
evidence of hardware related complications.
3. This patient had 19 prior cervical spine CTs since 2006-08-09 00:00:00.

CT head 2006-08-09 00:00:00
1. Stable appearance of right frontal hemorrhagic contusion
which exerts mass effect on the frontal Jamilia Kreymer of the right
lateral ventricle. Adjacent
subarachnoid hemorrhage shows mild increase.
2. Nondisplaced left superior frontal bone fracture, better
demonstrated on prior bone algorithm-reconstructed images.



Brief Hospital Course:
//Mr. Pierini was admitted to UPMCE on 2006-08-09 00:00:00 for bilateral SDH's.
He was in a cervical /collar for CT finding of stable C2
fracture and posterior cervical fusion. Repeat CT findings
showed a large increase in right SDH. He remained neurologically
unchnaged with LUE weakness and drift.

Patient left on 2006-08-09 00:00:00 against medical advice.

Medications on Admission:
