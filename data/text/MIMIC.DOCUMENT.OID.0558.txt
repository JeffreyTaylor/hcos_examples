History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 88F w/ h/o Grave's disease,
?CRI/?HTN & recently diagnosed RUL lung mass with LAD & liver
mets who presents from rehab with altered mental. Per her
rehabilitation facility, the patient is usually responsive to
her name and this evening became unresponsive to name. It is
unclear her baseline mental status. There is no evidence of
fever from rehabilitation records. Patient to altered to tell us
her symptoms.

In the ED, initial VS were: 86 84/40 18 100% 2L NC. CVL was
placed in RIJ. Labs were notable for acute kidney injury (Cr 4.3
<- 1.2 on 2011-10-04 00:00:00), leukocytosis with WBC 24.1 (up from recent
baseline of 17) w/ 91% polys, no bands & HCO3 15. Transaminases,
alk phos and lipase were elevated, however the specimen was
hemolyzed which can falsely elevate these values. Lactate 2.3.
123 Any St. read of CT head & abd/pelvis were negative for acute
process. Patient received 3L lactated ringers as well as
vancomycin 1g IV and zosyn 4.5mg IV empirically. While in the
ED, patient's BPs were 90s/60s (EMS) -> 84/40s (on presentation)
-> got 3L fluids with no change in BP -> 90s/40s -> started
levophed gtt @ 0.09 & BPs increased to 100-107/43-52. VS on
transfer were 78, 20, 100%2L, CVP 7->12, 98 rectal.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is non-verbal and unable to
partake in a review of systems questions.

CT 2011-10-04 00:00:00
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect
or
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are markedly prominent,
likely secondary to age-related global atrophy. There is no
shift of normally midline structures. The Hicham Drossel-white matter
differentiation is grossly preserved.  There is no evidence of
fracture. A large mucous retention cyst is noted in the right
maxillary sinus. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Significant global atrophy, likely age-related.
3. Large mucous retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus.

CT  2011-10-04 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study without IV contrast.
2. Similar 1.6 x 1.9 cm spiculated right upper lobe lesion with
associated
right hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, highly concerning
for malignancy.
3. 2-mm left upper lobe nodule, apparently new. Bibasilar
atelectasis and
left lower lobe discoid atelectasis. No definite focal airspace
consolidations.
4. Multifocal large hypodense lesions in the liver, incompletely
assessed
without IV contrast but compatible with widespread hepatic
metastases.
5. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
6. Evidence of tracheomalacia.
7. Large fibroid uterus.
8. Similar significant T11 and T12 compression fractures.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
This is a 88 yo female that presented with altered mental
status, hypotension, a right upper mass concerning for lung
cancer and evidence of metastatic spread.
.
#. Hypotension:  The patient presented with hypotension likely
due to a combination of hypovolemia (poor PO intake for the
preceeding days) and distributive/septic shock (given a WBC 24).
 The infectious source was not found.  CT of
chest/abdomen/pelvis was not revealing. UA was negative.  Blood,
Urine, and Sputum cultures were unrevealing for an infectious
source.  The patient was started on levophed gtt, but was
discontinued and made CMO (see below).  The patient was
initially place on vancomycin and zosyn, which were discontinued
after she was made CMO.
.
#. Altered mental status from toxic metabolic encephalopathy in
the context of multi123 Any St.sults including hypotension and
infection. A CT of her head was negative for an obvious cause of
altered mental status. Broad spectrim antibotics were started,
but stopped when made CMO.
.
#. Right Upper Lung Mass- The patient presented with a right
upper lung mass concerning for malignance with evidence of an
8th rib fracture and hepatic metastases
A further work up was deferred after the patient was made CMO.
.
#. hypercarbic respiratory failure-  The patient presented with
metabolic acidosis (likely from sepsis) with inappropriate
respiratory compensation.  She was intubated and placed on
mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She
was extubated and made CMO.
.
#. Comfort Measures Only- The patient was made CMO after
confirming with the patient's next of kind that the patient's
wish would be to remain as comfortable as possible until she
died.  She was extubated. Pressors were stopped.  The patient
was started on artificial tears, morphine prn, and all
medication were stopped other than those to maintain comfort.
.
#. Acute kidney Injury.  The patient presented hypovolemic and
labs consistent with  pre-renal/ATN.  All medications were
renally dose. Nephrotoxic drugs were avoided.  The Hicham Drossel Peffley
improved after fluid resuscitation.
.
#. Jacolby Peffley Pt home dose of levothyroxine was continued
until made CMO
.
#. Microcytic anemia: Likely from anemia of chronic inflammation
given labs results.
