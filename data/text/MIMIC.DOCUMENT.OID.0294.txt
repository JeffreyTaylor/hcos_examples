RENAL U.S. PORT

TECHNIQUE: Portable renal ultrasound with Doppler studies.

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.9 cm in length, the left
11.6 cm. Within the upper pole of the right kidney, two simple
cysts, each measuring 2.7 cm in diameter, are visualized, as
well as a 2.1 cm simple cyst in the lower pole of the left
kidney. These correspond to a hypoattenuating foci seen on the
recent CT. In the lateral mid pole of the right kidney, there is
a region of cortical echogenicity, which likely corresponds to
an area of relative perfusion defect on the recent CT. The
appearance may represent a small evolving renal infarct.

Doppler studies show normal flow in the right main renal artery
and vein, as well as normal arterial flow in interlobar arteries
among the upper, middle, and lower poles. The resistive indices
range from 0.63-0.70 on the right.

On the left, the main renal artery and vein are also patent, but
interlobar arteries show slight parvus et tardus waveforms,
particularly when compared to the opposite side. The resistive
indices among the interlobar arteries range from 0.63-0.86. In
the setting of portable technique, the Doppler studies of the
left kidney are somewhat suboptimal, but the findings suggest
that there is likely somewhat decreased perfusion to the left
kidney compared to the right.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small echogenic region involving the cortex in the right mid
pole, which correlates with a region of relative decreased
perfusion on the recent CT. This appearance may represent an
evolving infarct within a portion of the right mid pole.
2. Patency of flow to both kidneys. However, Doppler studies are
suggestive of somewhat decreased perfusion to the left compared
to the right

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates no interval change
in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is increased
perihilar opacity involving the bilateral hila and mild diffuse
increased airspace opacity representing mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the left costophrenic
angle representing a small effusion. The right costophrenic
angle is sharp. The trachea remains in the midline. Cardiomegaly
is unchanged.

IMPRESSION:

Cardiomegaly, unchanged.

Worsening CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted 2014-04-13 00:00:00

Stat lumbar drain placed - to decrease csf pressure less then 10
/ pt transfered to the SICU

A-line placed

Stroke service consulted / CT - reveals aortic dissection no
acute compression or infarct noted / the diseection and low BP
is thought to be responsible by decreasing the blood flow to the
spinal cord.

It is noticed if pts BP elevated, paralysis improves

Pt BP is kept elevated ( Pt also has ARF on admission ) / The
increase BP is probably due to decreasse blood flow to the
kidneys. / steroids started for ? acute cord infarction.

2014-04-13 00:00:00

Lumber drain stops working / replaced

troponin is increasing / pt started on beta blockers. The
increase troponin is thought to be due to hypoperfusion
syndrome.
