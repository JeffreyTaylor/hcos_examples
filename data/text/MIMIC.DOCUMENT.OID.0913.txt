Conclusions
Prebypass

1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5.There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. Dr. Fateen Quittschreiber was notified in person of the results on
2006-07-10 00:00:00 at 830 am.

Post bypass

1. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged

2. Patient is a - paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

3. Mechanical valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets move
well and the valve appears well seated. Peak gradient across the
valve is 22 mm Hg.

4. Aorta intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day for surgery, went to operating room for aortic
valve replacement on 2006-07-10 00:00:00.  See operative report for further
details.  Transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
management.  In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without
complications.  She continued to progress and was transferred to
the floor post operative day one.  Coumadin and heparin were
started for her mechanical valve, betablockers for rate control,
and lasix for gentle diuresis.

She awaited therapeutic INR and was ready for discharge home on
POD #6.
