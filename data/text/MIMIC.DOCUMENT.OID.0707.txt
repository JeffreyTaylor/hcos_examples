History of Present Illness:
Mr. Gillaspie is a healthy 16yo M with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes who developed the acute
onset of pressure both when needing to urinate and when trying
to hold his urine in on the morning of 2013-09-05 00:00:00. He denies any
fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea or back pain. He states
that he was eventually able to urinate but that it took a lot of
effort. Later that morning, he also developed hematuria and
clots in his urine. This was not associated with pain on
urination, but he did have the continued sensation of pressure.
He called Dr. Gillaspie who advised him to go the ER for
evaluation. Of note, he had undergone a urologic evaluation last
Thursday for a urine cytology which was reported as "suspicious"
in late 2013-09-05 00:00:00. Per the patient, his work-up last week was
unremarkable.

Vitals on arrival to the UPMCE ED: T 99, P 61, BP 147/68, sats
100% on RA. In the ED he had a 3-way Foley placed and was noted
to be passing clots. He was started on irrigation in the ED and
received morphine 4mg IV x1 and levsin 0.125mg PO x1. He also
received a total of 2L of NS. His hematuria did not clear with
irrigation so urology was consulted and he was admitted to
medicine for further treatment. His Hct remained stable.

On the floor, his VS were: T 96.0, BP 150/86, HR 87, RR 18, and
sats of 99% on Ra. He continued to have hematuria and his 3 way
foley irrigation was "Gillaspie-Aid" colored. He is able to get
comfortable for a few minutes at a time, but then intermittently
develops the sensation of "pressure" again. He denies any pain.
He specifically denies any back pain, nausea, abdominal pain,
fevers or chills. He denies any recent prior episodes of
hematuria. Review of systems is notable for an intentional 10
pound weight loss over the last 6 weeks which he attributes to
an increased exercise regimen (he and a friend walk daily around
Colan Gillaspie Centre). He denies any early satiety or change in
a123 Any St.e. He describes his energy as "good" and he feels
"healthy". He denies any dizziness, LH, headaches, visual
changes, recent upper respiratory infections, cough, SOB, CP,
change in his stool, or urinary issues, prior to his event
tonight.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Gillaspie is a healthy 16yo M with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes who developed the acute
onset of painless hematuria and pressure to urinate on 2013-09-05 00:00:00.

1) Hematuria: Has been passing both frank blood and clots.
Improved since being on 3 way bladder irrigation, but urine is
still Gillaspie-Aid colored. Colan Gillaspie, PT/PTT are normal. Urology saw the
patient in the ER and are planning to see him again in AM. He
may need additional urologic intervention if his symptoms
persist (? bleeding due to trauma from 123 Any St.us evaluation from
last week vs. other etiology). Unfortunately the records from
his urologic evaluation from last week are not available to us
currently but team will be able to obtain them through Dr. Colan Gillaspie office in the AM.
- for now, continue CBI with normal saline to keep urine pink
and free of clots
- repeat CBC, coags in AM
- make sure patient has active T+S
- continuing aspirin for now (only on 81mg daily) but would
discuss with urology
- holding on NSAIDs for now

2) Hypertension: Slightly hypertensive overnight (150/80). On no
meds, per his home medication list (though in OMR, it looks like
he used to be on atenolol). Would confirm list with
patient/family again in AM.

3) Hyperlipidemia: Continue lipitor.

4) Type II diabetes: Continue actos. Will put patient in for UPMCE
FS while in house.

5) h/o BPH and/or bladder spasm: Continue finasteride,
tamsulosin. Need to confirm oxybutynin dose with pharmacy in AM.


6) FEN: Regular diet. No IVF currently, can encourage PO intake.
Replete lytes prn. There is a medication on his home med list
which may be potassium chloride pills - would try to confirm
list of home meds with his outpatient pharmacy in AM.
7) Access: PIV.
8) PPX: Pneumoboots. No PPI indicated. Bowel regimen prn.
9) Contact:
- Colan Gillaspie Colan Gillaspie (pt's son) = HCP, phone test@mail.com
- Colan Gillaspie = 2nd emergency contact, phone test@mail.com
10) Code status: per patient's medication card, he has DNR/DNI
with his HCP --> need to confirm this in AM
11) Dispo: Pending resolution of his hematuria.

2013-09-05 00:00:00: Transferred to Urology service, Dr.[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1143**] Gillaspie, made
NPO and consented for cystoscopy, TURBT, fulgeration bleeding
bladder vessels.  He went to the OR and ultimately underwent a
cystoscopy and evacuation of bladder clot; please see the
detailed operative note for additional information. After the
procedure, pt became delerious likely in the post-op setting and
with administration of ativan requiring 5mg IM haldol, 2mg
midazolam x 2, 5mg morphine for sedation.

He was admitted to the UPMCE for overnight monitoring.  Agitation
was resolved by the morning of 2013-09-05 00:00:00.  Of note, pt was noticed to
have a. fib with occasional 2 second sinus pauses throughout the
night on tele.  His PCP was Colan Gillaspie and it was confirmed that
this has been his baseline. Pt underwent voiding trial on 2013-09-05 00:00:00
with only small amount of output and PVR of 325.  Foley was
replaced before d/c to urology and transferred to the urology
floor and out of the UPMCE.

2013-09-05 00:00:00:  There were no overnight events and Mr. Gillaspie
urine remained free of clots and light pink. There were no new
concerns and at time of discharge he was ambualating at
baseline, tolerating PO medications and diet and pain was well
controlled. He will be discharged to a rehab facility on 2013-09-05 00:00:00, 2013-09-05 00:00:00 with his foley catheter in place where he will have
services for one week before returning for voiding trial. All of
his questions were answered and those of his son Colan Gillaspie.
