CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval ptx s/p ct d/c

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old woman s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ptx s/p ct d/c
CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW

INDICATION: Status post bypass surgery. Discontinued lines and
extubated. Evaluate for pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison
with the next preceding chest examination of 2014-03-16 00:00:00.
During the interval, the patient has been extubated, and the NG
tube has been removed. The same holds for the Swan-Ganz catheter
and the sheath which has been replaced with a central venous
line seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the level 2 cm below
the carina. No pneumothorax has developed, and no new
infiltrates are seen. _____ on 123 Any St.us examinations, the noted
parenchymal densities in the upper lobe areas have resolved.
They were interpreted as representing edema.

IMPRESSION: Satisfactory chest findings after instrument
removal, no evidence of pneumothorax.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45% to 55%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  3.1 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. Cannot exclude LAA thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV
cavity size. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left atrial
appendage thrombus cannot be excluded. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior mid and apical
hypokinesis.
3. . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Episode of transient RV
dysfunction secondary to air visible in RCA. Epi 8-10 mcg given
with prompt resolution. Preserved biventricular systolic
function. Trace MR. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from UPMCE on 2014-03-16 00:00:00.
She had a preop vascular evaluation regarding her 123 Any St.us
carotid surgery and she was cleared.  Carotid doppler showed a
patent graft.  On 2014-03-16 00:00:00 she underwent CABGx3(LIMA->LAD,
SVG->OM, PDA).  The cross-clamp time was 50 mins., total bypas
time was 66 mins.  She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on Neo and
Propofol.  She was extubated on the post op night and continued
to progress.  She was on neo and eventually weaned off.  Her
chest tubes were d/c'd on POD#1 and wires were d/c'd on POD#3.
She continued to progress and was discharged to home in stable
condition on POD#4.
