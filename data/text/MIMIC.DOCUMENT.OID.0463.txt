Attending:Durelle Arnick
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
auto and allogeneic transplant with recurrence on monthly
chemotherapy admitted after he presented for scheduled
chemotherapy with fevers to 101 in clinic and transferred to the
ICU for persistent hypotension after bronchoscopy.
.
The patient initially presented to clinic on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 for
scheduled Gemzar, navelbine and decadron therapy. He was found
to have a fever to 101. On review of systems at that time the
patient did admit to feeling fatigued and generally unwell
possibly with a component of pleuritic chest pain and dry cough.
CXR at that time revealed an evolving RLL and lingular/LUL
infiltrate. He was admitted for further evaluation with CXR and
CT chest concerning for evolving pneumonia. The patient was
started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and Voriconazole. During his
hospital stay, the patient did have relative hypotension as at
baseline to the range of sbp 90's with tachycardia to the low
100's. The patient did have individual sbp measurements
overnight prior to transfer as low as 80's, reportedly fluid
responsive.
.
The patient was brought to the ICU for elective bronchoscopy.
During the procedure, the patient received 1mg midazolam and a
bolus of 25mcg of fentanyl. Post-procedure the patient was
persistently hypotensive to the range of sbp 78-82 with intact
mentation though some complaints of feeling tired and mildly
lightheaded. His hypotension was refractory to 1L of NS. The
patient was kept in the UPMCE for further monitoring.
.
Of note, the patient has a history of multiple episodes of
pneumonia in the past most recently with fungal pnuemonia based
upon positive galactomannan in 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
.
ROS: Denies any recent sick contacts. Notes mild pleuritic chest
pain and nausea. No emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, brbpr,
urinary complaints.

Hypothyroidism
Asthma
s/p biliary stent (see below)
Hepatitis B core+
.
Oncologic history:
1. Diagnosed with stage IIB Hodgkin's lymphoma in 12/99,
completed ABVD for four cycles with the last 1 2008-10-30 00:00:00 cycles
without bleomycin due to pulmonary toxicity, followed by
consolidative mantle radiation therapy.
2. Relapsed in 2008-10-30 00:00:00 treated with ICE x2 cycles, high-dose
Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization followed by CBV with
autologous stem cell transplant on 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
3. Relapsed in 2008-10-30 00:00:00 treated with ESHAP x 1 cycle in preparation
for allo stem cell transplant, which he underwent on 2008-10-30 00:00:00
from a sibling related donor with fludarabine and Cytoxan
conditioning. Transplant complicated by liver GVHD confirmed by
a biopsy on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 treated with prednisone. Also noted to be
hepatitis B core antibody positive at that time and began on
lamivudine to prevent reactivation.
4. Evidence for recurrent disease and status post a donor
lymphocyte infusion on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with a second one on 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
5. Further progression of his disease in 2008-10-30 00:00:00 and treated with
ESHAP x 2 cycles on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 and 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
6. Enrolled on the DC/DLI protocol and received these infusions
in mid 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with progressive disease particularly in his lung
base.
7. Outpatient regimen of Rituxan and gemcitabine with
unfortunately progressive symptoms and then followed with two
more cycles of ESHAP in 2008-10-30 00:00:00 and 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with an
excellent response to therapy.
8. Enrolled on an experimental protocol at the UPMCE involving
anti-CTLA-4 antibody with donor lymphocyte infusions support
with relatively stable disease.
9. Further progression of his disease over several months with
particularly increasing abdominal involvement and treated with
another cycle of ESHAP in 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
10. Treated with CEP chemotherapy on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with a donor
lymphocyte infusion on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 at 1 x 108 T cells per kilogram
with marked GVHD of the liver with increased transaminases and
bilirubin requiring CellCept and prednisone with eventual
resolution.
11. Following discontinuation of his immune suppression and no
further GVHD, noted for further progression of his disease, he
was treated with CEP chemotherapy on 2008-10-30 00:00:00, 2008-10-30 00:00:00, and
2008-10-30 00:00:00 with a response to treatment. Also requiring periodic
thoracenteses of now recurrent pleural effusions.
12. Status post DLI on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 at a dose of 1 x 10(8) T cells
per kilogram.
13. Presented in 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with increased liver function tests and
bilirubin with infiltration of the pancreatic head with
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. He had a biliary stent
placed. This was changed in 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
14. Treated with Day 1,2,3 only of CEP starting on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with
evidence for disease response on CT scan from 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
15. Rescanned in 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with progression of disease and then
received two more cycles of CEP on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 and 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with CT
scan on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 with response to therapy.
16. Consideration of another DLI, but developed progression of
disease with recurrent hydronephrosis. Treated with another
cycle of CEP on 2008-10-30 00:00:00. D8 held due to low counts. During
this admission, also had thoracentesis for pleural effusions.
17. Planned evaluation for H-DAC inhibitors at UPMCE.

CT Chest:
1. Overall improving patchy ground-glass opacities within the
lungs
bilaterally. Slight increased opacities involving anterior right
upper and
right middle lobes. Findings again suggestive of infection.
2. Unchanged mediastinal mass.
3. Slight decrease in size of right lower lobe mass.
4. Slight decrease in size of incompletely evaluated
retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
5. Tiny perihepatic ascites.

CT Abd:
1. Overall, stable retroperitoneal disease burden.
2. Slight improvement in some regions of consolidation within
the lungs,
although there is increased ground-glass opacity seen in the
upper lobe of
both the right and left lungs. This may be secondary in part to
regions of
improving aeration when compared to prior consolidation,
although some regions which appear to have worsening
ground-glass opacity may be secondary to atypical infection
including processes such as PCP, Deina Himmel other
infectious/inflammatory processes.
3. Unchanged appearance of mediastinal masses.
4. Multiple hypodense foci seen within the spleen and liver.
These
presumably may be secondary to Hodgkin involvement, and while
somewhat more prominent than on prior examination, they do not
appear to be new.
5. Moderately severe narrowing of the s123 Any St. vein, without
total occlusion at this time. In addition, there is
moderate-to-severe narrowing of the mid portal vein as well.

PATHOLOGY

Sigmoid colon biopsy:
1.  Diffuse regeneration of the crypts, consistent with a
healing process (see note).
2.  No viral inclusions, granulomas or tumor seen.
3.  Immunostain is negative for CMV with satisfactory control.

Renal biopsy, needle: Consistent with "acute tubular necrosis",
see note.

Bone marrow and core biopsy:
1.  Markedly hypocellular marrow with left-shifted myelopoiesis,
dysmegakaryo123 Any St., and mild eosinophilia, see note.
2.  No Hodgkin lymphoma seen.
Note: Overall the findings are suggestive of acute marrow injury
from secondary causes such as medications, toxic/metabolic,
immune insult etc.  Please correlate with clinical and other
laboratory, including cytogenetic findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 45-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's disease
status post multiple disease relapses after auto and allo SCT,
most recently treated with Gemzar, Navelbine and Decadron on 30
day cycle, who presented with fever to 101 prior to chemotherapy
administration.
.
## Fever/Pneumonia: CT findings suggested pneumonia as source of
fevers. He was initally treated with levoquin, but this was
changed to vancomycin cefepime/voriconizole for broader
coverage. Beacause of concern for sepsis, the patient was
transferred to UPMCE for bronchoscopy which revealed thick white
secretions c/w pna. Small blood in one of BAL samples was likely
due to trauma. Following bronchoscopy, the patient's SBP dropped
to 60s with Versed so got 500 cc bolus with improvement to
80s-90s. Post bronchoscopy CXR showed slight worsening of RLL
infiltrate. Sputum cultures were negative.  Pt was started in
extended course of Abx.  The patient had a repeat bronchoscopy
on 2008-10-30 00:00:00, with BAL cultures showing just oropharyngial flora and
no PCP.  Deina Himmel remained afebrile off antibiotics prior to
discharge.
Pt continued home salmeterol and albuterol for asthma
.
## Hypotension: Pt was noted to be hypotensive during his
admission.  He had a history of chronic steroid use which had
been discontinued. It was felt that his hypotension was possibly
due to adrenal insufficiency and he was restarted on stress dose
steroids with marked improvement in hemodynamic response. Pt
became nauseated and did not take prednisone or other oral meds
and was noted to have additional episodes of hypotension
2008-10-30 00:00:00.
He was switched to PO prednisone on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 and was discharged on
prednisone 10 mg daily.
- Consider tapering off prednisone as an outpatient.
.
## Diarrhea: 2008-10-30 00:00:00, pt reported having several loose stools.  He
was started on flagyl with concern for c. difficile.  GI was
consulted and the patient was subsequently started on PO
vancomycin, however c. dif testing was negative x 3.  Flex sig
was recommended done on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 showing normal mucosa in the
sigmoid colon (biopsied).
.
## Acute Renal Failure:  On 2008-10-30 00:00:00, pt was noted to have a non-gap
metabolic acidosis with a creatinine of 1.5.  He was started on
IV fluids with bicarb, however renal function progressively
worsened despite hydration.  Renal service was consulted.  A
vanco level was 57. Potentially nephrotoxic medications were
held, (including acyclovir).  Dialysis was initiated on 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
Renal biopsy done on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 c/w ATN.  He continued on dialysis
until 2008-10-30 00:00:00 and his HD line was removed on 2008-10-30 00:00:00.  Creatinine was
stable around 3.4 off dialysis.
- Follow electrolytes
- Outpatient renal f/u scheduled.
.
## Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient had a history of multiple
relapses. He was scheduled to receive Gemzar, Navelbine and
Decadron. Treatment was initially on hold given possible
infectious issues.  However, there was concern that renal
failure, diarrhea and rising LDH may be related, however renal
and GI biopsies were not consistent with lymphoma.
.
# Hypotension. Hemodynamically stable; thought to be due to
adrenal insufficiency. Pt was on hydrocortisone but switched to
Prednisone.  Was stable but had additional hypotension on 2008-10-30 00:00:00 so
was restated on high dose steroids- now on 10 mg
methylprednisolone daily.
.
# HBV core Ab positive. Continue lamivudine therapy.  Dosing was
adjusted for CrCl.
- Readjust dose per renal function.
.
# FEN: Regular diet.  2008-10-30 00:00:00 TPN initiated due to poor PO intake.
Stopped 2008-10-30 00:00:00.
