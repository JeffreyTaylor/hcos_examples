Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L Internal carotid artery stent placement.

History of Present Illness:
82 yo Male with symptomatic Jatorian Koneval stenosis admitted to CCU after
carotid stent placement. Pt has severe vascular disease - 90%
Jatorian Koneval stenosis, 30-60% 123 Any St. stenosis, CAD - NQWMI in 2007-08-27 00:00:00 (found
2VD - 70% ostial RCA, TO LCx distally with collateral flow). Pt
also has PVD and ?RAS. Sig risk factors include DM,

Of note he did have low BP on arrival before procedure started
(had taken captopril at home). He was asymptomatic with sBP in
the 70's. Was brought to the CCU on neosynephrine.
     Pt is relatively poor historian - unable to explain why he
had procedure. Per notes, pt began to become symptomatic with L
sided amaurosis fugax x 2 episode (pt describes vision going
dark all around a pinpoint of light in the center of his vision)
and syncopal episode ~1month prior where he was sitting in a
chair and lost consciousness although he maintained his seated
position but had urinary incontinence.

Pertinent Results:
Jatorian Koneval stent report:
1.  Access was retrograde via the right CFA.
2.  Thoracic aorta:  Type I arch without flow-limiting disease.
3.  Renal arteries:  bilateral disease, mild on the RRA.  The
LRA had a
focal 80% lesion.
4.  Subclavian arteries:  The RSCA had a focal 60% lesion after
the
origin of the vertebral.  The LSCA had mild disease.
5.  Carotid/vertebral arteries:  The right vertebral is patent
without
lesions.  There was mild disease at the origin of the left
vertebral.
The cerebellar arteries are normal.  The basilar system filled
the left
MCA from a patent PCOM.  The RCCA was normal.  The 123 Any St. had a
60% lesion
and filled the ipsilateral ACA, MCA and contralateral ACA via
the ACOM.
The LCCA was normal.  There was a focal 90% lesion at the
bifurcation.
The Jatorian Koneval filled the ipsilateral MCA.
6.  Successful stenting of the Jatorian Koneval was performed with a 7.0 x
40 mm
123 Any St.e stent.
7.  Right femoral angiography demonstrated severe diffuse
disease in the
RCFA with almost complete obstruction of distal filling from the
6F
sheath.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe Jatorian Koneval stenosis.
2. Stenting of the Jatorian Koneval.
3. Severe left RAS.
4. Severe right CFA disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo man with severe vascular disease with symptomatic Jatorian Koneval
disease, 90% stenosis on U/S with amaurosis fugax and possible
syncopal episode now s/p carotid stent with good restoration of
flow.
1. CV:
Jatorian Koneval Jenison s/p stent: Keep pt on ASA, plavix, atorvastatin. sBP was
kept between 140-160 initially to keep flow brisk in setting of
new stents and then overnight as Neo was weaned BP started to
fall. Neo was increased for a few hours, but then BP remained
stable and Neo was titrated off. Etiology for hypotension was
felt to most likely be increased vagal tone after [**Doctor First Name 3050**] surgery.
Pt will continue to refrain from taking BP meds for the next few
days and follow up for a BP check on 2007-08-27 00:00:00.
B. CAD: Continue ASA, plavix, simvastatin. Restart BP meds (BB
and ACE) as outpt after BP check.
2. Pulm: COPD - continue inhalers and nebs prn. Nasal Cannula O2
to keep sats ~92%.
3. Renal: RAS seen on cath. Dr. Jatorian Koneval likely to place stents in
future. Cr remained stable after surgery.
4. ID: stable.
5. GI: percutaneous biliary drain in place. Scheduled for
surgery 2007-08-27 00:00:00 in UPMCE.
6. GU: pt voided easily with good UOP. Restart Proscar on
discharge.
7. Heme: post-procedure hct stable. No s/sx hematomas. No
bruits.
8. Endo: NIDDM. Continue RISS and restart glyburide as outpt.
Diabetic diet.
9. Neuro/Psych: reports no recent EtoH. Pt showed no s/sx of
withdrawal.
10. Ppx: DVT ppx - encouraged ambulation. PT/OT helped. Eating.
