History of Present Illness:
Per Dr.Gwynetta Vian note:  The patient is a 63-year-old male with a
history of lymphoma diagnosed in 2014-12-15 00:00:00 for which he received
radiation therapy and CHOP. He developed paralysis of the left
leg due to radiation in 2014-12-15 00:00:00 and has been dependent on a brace
and crutches. He developed radiation colitis with periodic
rectal bleeding and incontinence of stool and urine in 2014-12-15 00:00:00. He
developed recurrent lymphoma in the porta hepatis and was
treated with radiation therapy in 2014-12-15 00:00:00. He also received
CHOP and RICE. He developed a biliary stricture and common
hepatic duct obstruction and underwent ERCP and stent placement
in 2014-12-15 00:00:00 and 2014-12-15 00:00:00. Those stents were removed. In
2014-12-15 00:00:00, he presented with fever and elevated LFTs. He had
an ERCP at that time and was subsequently referred to UPMCE
where he underwent an ERCP on 2014-12-15 00:00:00. This demonstrated the
presence of an existing plastic stent that was blocked with
sludge and was removed. He had small stone fragments and pus
that were seen extruding from the common duct once the stent was
removed. There was a long benign-appearing stricture of the
common bile duct and common hepatic duct with dilatation of the
intrahepatic ducts proximally. Cytology was negative. Since
then, he has undergone several follow-up ERCPs and dilatation.
He has also undergone repeated brushings for cytology that have
all been benign.
.
Because of recurrent stricture that has been unresponsive to
endoscopic dilatation, he was referred for consideration of
Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. We have discussed the indications
for surgical repair, the surgical procedure itself, risks,
potential complications, postoperative recovery, follow-up, and
outcomes. The patient has provided informed consent and is
brought to the operating room for cholecystectomy, common bile
duct excision, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

Past Medical History:
1)  Left leg paralysis from radiation to pelvic fossa in 2014-12-15 00:00:00
2)  atrial fibrillation
3)  histiocytic-lymphocytic lymphoma s/p CHOP and XRT
4)  large B-cell lymphoma to porta hepatis s/p XRT, CHOP and
cyclophosphamide (2014-12-15 00:00:00) now without evidence of disease
5)  gastritis
6)  history of HCV with reportedly unremarkable liver biopsy,
though pt remarks that he was told he has early signs of
cirrhosis - will attempt to get outside records
7)  status post left leg fracture.
8)  bilateral inguinal hernia repair
9)  gastritis
10)VRE bacteremia 2014-12-15 00:00:00
11)2014-12-15 00:00:00 Common bile duct excision, Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy, cholecystectomy, segment IVB mass
resection, intraoperative ultrasound

Social History:
His social history is significant for the fact that he is
married and is currently employed as a psychologist.  He is
currently retiring from his practice due to health reasons.  He
has two adult children who are healthy.


Family History:
His family medical history is significant for his parents who
are both deceased, his mother from hypertension and father from
congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
On 2014-12-15 00:00:00 he underwent common bile duct excision, Roux-en-y
hepaticojejunostomy, cholecystectomy, segment IVB mass resection
with intraoperative ultrasound and liver biopsy. Surgeon was Dr.
Gwynetta Brooklee Abbruzzi Vian. Please see operative report for details. Two
JPs were placed. There were two PTCs.  Postop, he was
comfortable on a dilaudid pca. SBP ranged between 88-90 postop
and he received 1.5 liters of fluid boluses. A CXR and EKG were
wnl. An NG was in place and he was npo.

On pod 2, Linezolid was switched to Daptomycin for h/o VRE in
blood. Cefepime continued for E.coli and pseudomonas in the
bile/blood. The NG was removed. He developed rapid afib and was
transferred to the SICU. IV diltiazem was given with conversion
back to a sinus rhythm. Heart rate decreased to the 70s. On
2014-12-15 00:00:00 a tube cholangiogram was performed showing good position
of the catheter with free drainage of contrast material into the
jejunem. There was no evidence of communication between the
biliary system and the vasculature. Two small dilatations of
peri123 Any St. biliary ducts in the right liver lobe.
On 2014-12-15 00:00:00 a TTE was performed showing no endocarditis. Dapto and
cefepime were discontinue as he had received an appropriate
course of treatment.

He developed melena and hematachezia on 2014-12-15 00:00:00. Hct decreased to
25 from 31 and  4 PRBC, 2 FFP and 1 bag of cryo were given with
a hct increase to 32. A c.line was placed for blood products and
rapid infusion. A repeat tube cholangiogram was performed on
2014-12-15 00:00:00 demonstrating good position without evidence of
communication with the vasculature or extravasation. The t tube
and PTCs were opened. The left PTC and t tube were drainin
sanguinous fluid as well as the JPs. He remained NPO.  A fib
recurred. A diltiazem drip was resumed and lopressor was
increased to 37.5mg UPMCE. Dilt was eventually weaned off. On
2014-12-15 00:00:00 he was in rapid afib with rates into the 150-160s. IV
lopressor was given x 3 without effect. He was transferred back
to the SICU for managment. Hematocrits were cycled. Hct was
stable. He again started passing black tarry stool and the
biliary drains again started draining serosanguinous fluid. LFTs
trended up with the t.bili increasing to 6.7 and alk phos up to
300s.

On 2014-12-15 00:00:00, a hepatic arteriogram was performed showing
approximately 2 cm pseudoaneurysm involving the left hepatic
artery in segment II. Dr. Vian successfully performed coiling
of the pseudoaneurysm as well as directly proximal and distal
branches resulting in total occlusion of the aneurysm. He spiked
a temp to 101.9. He was pancultured. ID evaluated and
recommended resuming Daptomycin and Cefepime. These antibiotics
were stopped on 2014-12-15 00:00:00 as cultures remained negative.

On 2014-12-15 00:00:00, the right PTC was capped. LFTs continued to improve
and on 2014-12-15 00:00:00, the left PTC was capped.  His LFTs continued to
improve with both PTC drains capped and he remained afebrile.
.
PT evaluated him and felt that he had returned to his baseline
requiring assist for transfers. Home PT was recommended. VNA
services were arranged for PT, dressing changes and monitoring.
.
Diet was slowly advanced and tolerated.  He was deemed stable
for discharge home with services on 2014-12-15 00:00:00 tolerating a regular
diet, at baseline requiring assistance for transfers, pain
well-controlled, and both PTC drains capped without pain or
fevers.  He will follow-up with Dr. Brooklee Abbruzzi in clinic.  He will
follow-up with his gastroenterologists for adjustment of his GI
medications and his cardiologists for adjustment of his BP
medications.
