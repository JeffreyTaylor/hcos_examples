She has not been feeling well for a while now, with chest pain,
fatigue and SOB.  These symptoms have been present for many
months, but the CP and SOB have been more severe over the last
couple days.  Two days ago she started experiencing a squeezing,
pressure pain on the left side of the chest and left shoulder,
which at times radiated down the left arm. The pain occurs at
rest and nothing, except for nitroglycerin, improves or resolve
this pain. This episode she had two weeks ago lasted for about

resolve it completely. After two hours the pain resolved on its
own. She is not experiencing CP, SOB now.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  2005-08-24 00:00:00 1:20 PM
IMPRESSION: Free fluid and large amount of fat stranding seen
within the abdomen, particularly in the region of the s123 Any St.
flexure. Relative narrowing of the SMA. Findings are concerning
for ischemic colitis. 2) No evidence of obstruction or
intra-abdominal mass. 3) Status post left nephrectomy. Multiple
small rounded low attenuation lesions seen within the right
kidney, possibly representing cysts but incompletely
characterized on this single-phase study.
.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of the multiple massively dilated loops
of large bowel.

2. Unusual appearance of a loop of bowel projecting within the
mid pelvis, probably air filled small bowel--continued followup
advised.

DIAGNOSIS:

Fibroadipose tissue and mesothelium with reactive changes,
consistent with hernial sac.
.
RENAL U.S. PORT  2005-08-24 00:00:00 12:22 AM

IMPRESSION:
Mild prominence of the collecting system suggestive of a very
mild hydronephrosis. Probable non-obstructive 4 mm right upper
pole renal calculi.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2005-08-24 00:00:00 4:20 PM

IMPRESSION:

1. Low position of endotracheal tube as communicated to Dr.
Bourdon.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  87 yo F with h/o chronic renal insuficiency, nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis who
presents with hyperkalemia and ECG changes.
.
.
1. Hyperkalemia: Pt's h/o of CRI and hypertensive
nephrosclerosis are most concerning for an etiology. She also
has a history of MGUS. Pt has been eating poorly which would
suggest a component of decreased effective circulating volume.
Given these conditions it is likely that decreased urinary
potassium excretion (from all these separate causes) is the
underlying process. It is unclear how compliant patient is with
meds and this could be contributing as well.
- Give IV fluids
- check K q6h; give kayexelate if K elevated
- Maintain on telemetry
- Reorder ECG
- Check SPEP, UPEP - to check for multiple myeloma
- Hold ACE inhibitor
- low K diet
- nutrition consult
.
2. CRI: baseline creat 2.0, pt at baseline now.
- IV fluids
- check creat
- renal consult was obtained
.
3. Hypertension: Patient with history of poorly controlled
hypertension.
- Will continue home BP meds, and uptitrate as tolerated.
- Hold ACEI
.
4. Chest pain: Patient with episode of chest pain two days
prior, with multiple RF including high cholesterol, DM2, age,
hypertension. Although pain resolved at this time, will check
for cardiac origin.
- Will check CE
- EKG shows no acute ST-T changes
- Continue labetolol, aspirin. Hold ACEI for now.
- Check lipid panel, A1c
- Check repeat echocardiogram
.
5. Weight loss: Patient endorses recent 20# weight loss, and has
history of colon cancer. Overdue for colonoscopy. Also noted to
have abdominal pain, but without acute abdomen.
- Check LFTs, amylase, lipase
- Needs outpatient colonoscopy
- Guaiac all stools.
- Nutrition consult as above
.
6. Anemia: baseline HCT per records has been in low 30s. Now at
28.  Might be anemia of chronic disease or secondary to
malnutrition given reported poor PO intake in last months. No
obvious bleeding, but will like to check stool.
- guiaic all stools
- Fe studies.
.
7 Hyperlipidemia: history of hyperlipidemia on record, but
current lipid panel results were within normal levels
.
8 Chronic LE edema: long time issue.  Stable now. No pain,
erythema or skin color changes. CHF a possibility and will be
explored.
- check Echocardiogram for EF
.
9 Hypothyroid: stable condition
- continue Levothyroxine

================================================================
She was transfered to the Surgery service and went to the OR on
2005-08-24 00:00:00 for:
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Extensive lysis of adhesions.
3.  Repair of small bowel serosal injury.
4.  Right and left component ventral herniorrhaphy.

She remained in the ICU for 6 days.

CRI: She had post-op low urine output with ATN. She continued on
IVF and occasional Lasix and Diuril. Once her urine output
picked up, the Diuretics were held. She had autodiuresis and her
Cr began to fall as she mobilized fluids. She continued on D5
1/2NS for several day and we then encouraged PO intake. Her
Foleuy was removed as her urine output picked up.

Abd/GI: She was NPO with a NGT. Her incision was intact with a
moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage. She had a
surrounding area of ecchymosis around the incision. She had
abdominal JP drains in place with high output (>1000cc
drainage).
She was started on a PO diet on POD 5. Her PO intake was
marginal and we encouraged additional PO's. The drain output was
still high from drain #2 at time of discharge (1000-2000cc/day).
The drains will remain in place until follow-up.

CV: She was in normal sinus rhythm with frequent PVC's. She was
started on an Amiodarone drip. She had occasional bradycardia.
She had a episode of rapid Afib while repostioning the patient
on POD 4 with a rate in the 150's. She converted shortly
thereafter with a rate in the 60's. She continued on PO
Amiodarone once back on a diet.

Resp: She remained intubated and on the vent. She was extubated
on 2005-08-24 00:00:00 and tolerated this.

ID: She was on Cipro/Flagyl and Ampicillin antibiotics for
peritonitis and ischemic bowel. Stop antibiotics on 2005-08-24 00:00:00.
