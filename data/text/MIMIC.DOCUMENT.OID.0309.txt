ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic pelvic pain.
2.  Enlarged multifibroid uterus.
3.  Endometriosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic pelvic pain.
2.  Enlarged multifibroid uterus.
3.  Endometriosis.

INDICATIONS FOR ADMISSION:  The patient had a longstanding
history of endometriosis with priory surgery dating back to
2005-04-08 00:00:00.  She had gone on to develop an enlarged 12-week to
15-week size multifibroid uterus along with additional cystic
change of the ovary.  She was not planning to have children,
and when consulted on the various options agreed to surgery
with a goal of removing the uterus and adnexa in an effort to
manage her chronic pelvic pain and bleeding.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission,
she was taken to the operating room and underwent extensive
surgery
via laparotomy.  The procedure was complicated by a left
ureteral transection which was repaired under the auspices of
the Urology Service ( a separate Operative Note was dictated
for that.  Additionally, due to the intense fibrotic scarring
secondary to her endometriosis, consultation was requested
from Dr. 123 Any St.g
dissection of the uterus and adnexa, ultimately resulting in
a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy which confirmed endometriotic changes.
There was a great deal of dissection involved in separating
the posterior uterine surface from the bowel, but no entry
into the bowel occurred.

Her intraoperative course was punctuated by receipt of two
units of transfused packed red blood cells.  Due to
continuing anemia, she received an additional three units on
2005-04-08 00:00:00.  Her lowest hematocrit appeared to be 24, and at
discharge had risen to 27.9.

Her postoperative course basically was smooth.  She did
receive intravenous antibiotics.  A urinary stent had been
placed in the left ureter which was to be removed
approximately 10 days postoperatively in the urologist's
office.  She remained stable throughout the course and began
to pass gas within two to three days and had resumption of
bowel function.  Pain control was managed with narcotic
analgesics.

She was discharged on her sixth postoperative day in stable
condition.  She was afebrile with a hematocrit of 27.9.  She
was to continue replacement iron and was to be seen the
following week for removal of the urinary catheter.  She was
subsequently seen also in my office for scheduled
postoperative appointments and was making a uncomplicated
recovery at that point.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic pelvic pain.
2.  Multifibroid uterus.
3.  Endometriosis (severe stage 4).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient will continue
to be followed at the UPMCE office of UPMCE.
