History of Present Illness:
Mr. Schlicht is a 73 year old male who underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting and Maze procedure on 2011-04-07 00:00:00. he has
done well since, maintaining sinus rhythm.  During a routine
followup cardiac MRI, he was noted to have an aortic dissection
involving the ascending aorta. Given the findings, he was
admitted for further evaluation and treatment. He was relatively
asymptomatic but was complaining of some right sided chest
discomfort which appeared more musculoskeletal in nature. On
admission, he denied back pain, syncope, lightheadedness and
dizziness.

Pertinent Results:
2011-04-07 00:00:00 Cardiac MRI:
Aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta; dissection does
not appear to involve the valve plane on the provided images but
probably approaches within 1-2 cm. Origin of a coronary bypass
graft on the anterolateral aspect of the ascending aorta is
located immediately adjacent to the dissection flap.
2011-04-07 00:00:00 Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
2011-04-07 00:00:00 Coronary CTA:
1. Short segment dissection (43 mm) in the ascending aorta,
extending just below the origin of the graft in the right
lateral border of the aorta to the level of the sinotubular
junction, without involving the origins of the grafts or native
coronary arteries.
2. Patent all three bypass grafts: left anterior mammary artery
to left anterior descending, graft from aorta to obtuse marginal
one, and graft from aorta to right coronary artery.
3. Mild cardiomegaly.
4. Small amount of fluid surrounding the ascending aorta and a
small amount of pericardial effusion, probably related to recent
surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Schlicht was directly admitted to the Cardiovascular
Intensive Care Unit for strict blood pressure control. He was
hypertensive on admission and started on Nipride which was
titrated for goal systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg. In
anticipation for surgical intervention, he was given Vitamin K
for Warfarin reversal. Further evaluation included an
echocardiogram and coronary CT angiogram - see result section
for details. Given his Iodine allergy, he was pre-treated with
Prednisone and Benadryl without complication.

On 2011-04-07 00:00:00, he underwent redo sternotomy with repair of his
chronic type A aortic dissection. For surgical details, please
see operative note. Given inpatient stay was greater than 24
hours, Vancomycin was given for perioperative antibiotics.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. He weaned from bypass easily.  Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident.

His hypertension was treated with beta blockers and ACE
inhibition. Anticoagulation was not resumed as he has been in
sinus rhythm.  Diuresis was begun towards his preoperative
weight. Physical therapy worked with him for strengthening an d
mobilization. A short stay in a rehabilitatiuon facility was
necessary before return to independent living.
