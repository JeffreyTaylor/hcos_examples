Date of Birth: 1961-10-08 00:00:00 00:00:00     Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year-old woman who
had a preop electrocardiogram for a spinal surgery that was
notable for ischemic changes.  She underwent a stress
echocardiogram on 2010-08-17 00:00:00 that demonstrated inferior wall
near akinesis.  On 2010-08-17 00:00:00 she underwent a cardiac
catheterization that revealed a 50% occlusion of her LAD and
a 90% occlusion of her left circumflex as well as a 100%
occlusion of the RCA.  She had an echocardiogram that
demonstrated an ejection fraction of approximately 40%.  The
decision was made that the patient should undergo a coronary
artery bypass surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Rocaltrol 0.625 mg q.d.,
Nephrocaps 1 mg po q.d., Lipitor 10 mg po q.d., Provera 2.5
mg po q.d., Premarin 0.625 mg q.d., Norvasc 5 mg po b.i.d.,
Gabapentin 100 mg po t.i.d. and Dilaudid 4 mg po q.i.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stable angina.  2.  Type 2 insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis and neuropathy.
3.  Hypertension.  4.  Hypercholesterolemia.  5.
Degenerative joint disease at the L4-L5 interspace.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on 2010-08-17 00:00:00 to the UPMCE Service.  On 2010-08-17 00:00:00 the patient
underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass graft times
three with the left internal mammary coronary artery to the
left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein
graft to the obtuse marginal 1, and the saphenous vein graft
to the right posterior descending coronary artery.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to
the CSRU intubated and in stable condition.

Immediately postoperative, the patient was able to answer
questions and follow commands.  She was weaned off of the
ventilator and extubated.  Her chest tube was notable for a
small air leak initially.  On postoperative day one she was
started on Lopressor as well as aspirin.  She was weaned from
the Levophed and started on a renal diet.  Her pleural chest
tube was left in place and the Renal Service was consulted
for management of her dialysis.  At that time she was being
atrially paced at 80 over a normal sinus rhythm at 60.  Her
Levophed was discontinued and she was weaned from the
Milrinone.  She underwent hemodialysis.  On postoperative day
two the patient's heart rate was in the 80s with sinus rhythm
with a blood pressure of 118/67.  Her pacemaker was
subsequently turned off as it was competing with her
underlying rhythm.  She was stable and was transferred to the
floor.

On the floor the UPMCE hospital course was uneventful.
She remained afebrile with good pain control and maintaining
a sinus rhythm.  She experienced some nausea and some emesis
associated with her potassium supplements.  Her blood sugars
were well controlled, but she was somewhat anorexic.  She
also began complaining of some mild mid epigastric tenderness
on postoperative day five associated with some nausea.  She
was also noted to have an elevated white blood cell count of
24,000, as well as mildly elevated transaminase and alkaline
phosphatase levels.  She underwent a KUB, which was notable
for her colon being full of stool.  She also had a right
upper quadrant ultrasound that was negative for biliary
disease processes.  She was begun on a regimen of Cascara and
Milk of Magnesia with subsequent large bowel movements with
relief of her abdominal pain.  She was noted to have a
somewhat swollen right lower extremity, which was the site of
the saphenous vein graft and concern for a possible deep
venous thrombosis as the etiology of the increased white
blood cell count prompted a venous duplex ultrasound.  The
result of this study was negative for deep venous thrombosis.

By postoperative day nine the patient had remained afebrile
and her white count had steadily declined to 17,400.  The
patient was subsequently discharged with instructions to
return to clinic and/or the Emergency Department if she
should become ill.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was afebrile
with stable vital signs.  She was in no acute distress, alert
and oriented.  Her lungs were clear.  Her sternum was stable.
Her incision was clean, dry and intact.  Her heart had a
regular rate and rhythm and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at
the base.  Her belly was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her
extremities were warm and well profused and her incision was
clean, dry and intact.  She had a small amount of swelling on
her right lower extremity.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 12.5 mg po b.i.d., Percocet
one to two tablets po q 3 to 4 hours prn pain, Colace 100 mg
po b.i.d., ECASA 81 mg po q.d., Ibuprofen 400 mg po t.i.d.,
Gabapentin 100 mg po t.i.d., Amiodarone 400 mg po b.i.d.
times seven days and then 400 mg po q.d., Nephrocaps one
tablet q.d., Premarin 0.625 mg po q.d., Rocaltrol 0.5 mg po
q.d., Provera 2.5 mg po q.d.

The patient was subsequently discharged in stable condition
with instructions to return to the clinic or the Emergency
Department if she was feeling ill and to follow up with Dr.
Houghtaling in one weeks time as well as her primary care physician
Houghtaling. Bralin in one to two weeks time.  She is sent home with
plans for 123 Any St. VNA to come in and check on her for home
safety and cardiopulmonary evaluation.
