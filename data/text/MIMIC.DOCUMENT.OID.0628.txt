HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 42-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of cerebellar
astrocytoma diagnosed in 2005-09-11 00:00:00 by biopsy.  He then followed up
with radiation therapy.  The patient was known to have
recurrence of his tumor by biopsy on 2005-09-11 00:00:00.  He did not
have chemotherapy secondary to infectious issues.  The
patient was noted to have increased unsteadiness of gait per
a clinic note.

The patient came in with a one day headache on the left and
vomiting times four days.  He said that the left side
numbness and weakness was worse.  The patient also had a
history of diabetic complications from steroids.  He had a
head CT scan on admission, which showed a large bleed into
the site of the prior tumor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history included
hepatitis B positive, PPD positive, herpetic keratitis,
epididymitis and piloid astrocytoma, which was recurrent.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient had biopsies times two,
the last one being in 2005-09-11 00:00:00.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a blood pressure of 140/94, a heart rate of 60, a
respiratory rate of 16 and an oxygen saturation of 100% on
room air.  He was awake, alert and in no acute distress.  The
heart had a regular rate and rhythm with an S1 and S2.  The
lungs were clear bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.

Neurologically, the pupils were unequal and reactive with the
right being greater than left in size.  On the left, there
was no lateral gaze.  The tongue was midline.  The left
finger-to-nose was inaccurate.  There was a left facial
droop.  The left upper extremity was 2005-09-11 00:00:00 and the left lower
extremity was 2005-09-11 00:00:00.  The patient had no drift.  He was alert
and oriented times three.  Speech was fluent.  He was
following commands.

RADIOLOGY:  A CT scan showed a 3 cm bleed with significant
mass effect with an obstructive hydrocephalus.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a sodium of
140, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 101, bicarbonate of 24,
BUN of 12, creatinine of 0.7 and glucose of 161.  There was a
white blood cell count of 7000, hematocrit of 44.5 and
platelet count of 294,000.  Prothrombin time was 13, partial
thromboplastin time was 29 and INR was 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the surgical
intensive care unit.  On 2005-09-11 00:00:00, the patient went to the
operating room for a left suboccipital craniotomy for
evacuation of hematoma and right frontal drain placement
without complications.

The patient continued to be monitored in the surgical
intensive care unit.  He was awake, alert, following commands
and moving all extremities strongly.  He did have a left
upper motor neuron seventh nerve palsy, which was there prior
to surgery.  Vital signs remained stable.  The ventricular
drain was pulled out by the patient on 2005-09-11 00:00:00 and was
replaced.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day #1.

On 2005-09-11 00:00:00, the patient became tachypneic, requiring
intubation for full respiratory failure.  On neurological
examination, the patient was following commands.  He had left
lateral gaze to the midpoint, but was unable to go to extreme
lateral gaze on the left.  The right eye had slight lateral
gaze deviation.  He was following simple commands.  He had
decreased strength on the right, but improved, with no focal
drift.  The patient was extubated on 2005-09-11 00:00:00 and had a
swallow study which showed that the patient was aspirating
with all consistencies.  Therefore, the patient was made
n.p.o. and a feeding tube was placed.

A family meeting was held with the family to discuss the
grave prognosis of the patient's condition.  The patient was
initially made "Do Not Resuscitate"/"Do Not Intubate", but
after he became extubated and the situation was explained to
him and his condition improved, the patient rescinded the "Do
Not Resuscitate"/ "Do Not Intubate" status and was now a full
code.

The patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit.
The drain was discontinued on 2005-09-11 00:00:00.  He was transferred
to the regular floor.  Vital signs remained stable.  The
patient was afebrile.

The patient was seen by the gastrointestinal service for
placement of a PEG tube.  At this time, we are still awaiting
PEG tube placement, which should occur today, 2005-09-11 00:00:00.
Then the patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for a
short stay prior to discharge to home.

Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
Decadron 2 mg b.i.d.
Acyclovir 400 mg b.i.d.
