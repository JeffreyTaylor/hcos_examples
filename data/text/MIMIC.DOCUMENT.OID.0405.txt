History of Present Illness:
24yo man with h/o Parkinson's disease, multiple prior admissions
for aspiration pneumonia most recently 2014-05-29 00:00:00, who presents
again from UPMCE Rehab after the staff there had "trouble
waking him up" this AM, and found him to be in mixed respiratory
failure. On the prior admit, the pt was diagnosed with a LLL pna
and treated with vancomycin/zosyn. Per his wife, the patient was
doing relatively well last week, still in the MACU at UPMCE
Rehab since his recent discharge from UPMCE but with a plan to
transition to the regular floor soon. His ABG on 2014-05-29 00:00:00 was
7.34/69/55 on room air, which is close to his baseline pCO2. On
Saturday 2d PTA, the pt's wife noted that he was congested more
than baseline, initially unable to cough, but then improved
after neb treatments with the production of brown-pink
secretions.  He had hyperglycemia to FS 223, which per wife he
has never had before (no h/o DM). By Saturday night though he
was doing well, less congested and speaking clearly. Then,
Sunday AM, he was congested again and though he received nebs he
was not able to cough out the secretions. Per the Pulmonologist
note from Sunday PM, he was then found to be poorly arousable,
with RR 30, shallow breathing, lungs clear, O2 sat 90% on pulse
oximeter. ABG performed, 7.20/107/44, O2 sat 68% on ABG,
presumably on room air though unclear. BIPAP was written for
(IPAP 16, EPAP 3), though it is not clear if this was started.
He was shortly thereafter intubated after the Pulmonologist
confirmed his Full Code status with the pt's wife. After
intubation, it was noted that he had copious thick yellow
secretions in his trachea, which were felt to be the culprit
causing obstruction and hypercarbia/hypoxemia. With suctioning
his breathing improved, and he was transferred to UPMCE for
further work up. The patient remained awake the whole time. He
was noted to have a temp of 100.4F this AM.
.
Upon arrival to the UPMCE ED, he appeared to be in no
respiratory distress. His initial ABG was 7.34/67/315. He was
found to be febrile to 100.4F, with HR 60s-70s, SBPs ranged
60s-80s. His CXR was concerning to the ED staff for RUL/RLL
processes (though appears to have only persistent LLL , and he
was given CTX, Vanc, and Flagyl out of concern for nosocomial
vs. aspiration pna. His urine was leuk esterase (+) on UA,
culture pending. Blood cultures were also sent. He received 1L
NS for hypotension, and subsequently his pressures were still
low so he was started on a dopamine drip via a newly-placed RIJ
(per report, sterile placement via ultrasound in the ER). He
also had a 18G PIV placed, and has a PICC line from UPMCE Rehab
that is of unclear age or indication (felt to be from prior need
for IV abx). His ECG was notable for Q-wave in V1, ST elevations
laterally, concerning for ischemia. TnT 0.10, CK 22, MB not
done. Lact 0.6. He was given ASA 325mg PR. His wife confirmed
that he is full code.

2014-05-29 00:00:00 CXR:
INDICATIONS:  24-year-old man with Parkinson's disease,
pneumonia, and left effusion, intubated.
CHEST, AP SUPINE:  Comparison is made to 2014-05-29 00:00:00.  The
patient is now intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates
approximately 4 cm above the carina near the thoracic inlet.
The lung volumes are low.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours
are similar.  Markedly calcified subcarinal lymphadenopathy is
again noted.  There is persistent left lower lobe opacity with
an effusion, as well as a new mild congestive heart failure or
pulmonary venous hypertension.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post endotracheal intubation.
2.  Persistent left lower lobe opacity.
3.  Mild congestive heart failure or fluid overload.
.
2014-05-29 00:00:00 AXR:
Single supine AP: Part of the left hemipelvis is not included in
the study. The study is also centered around the pelvis rather
than including the whole abdomen. The visualized portion of the
abdominal cavity demonstrate normal bowel gas pattern with stool
noted within the ascending colon and sigmoid colon.  The bone
and soft tissues structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
No acute abdominal pathology is identified. No evidence of
obstruction or free intra-abdominal air is noted.
.
2014-05-29 00:00:00 CXR: Worsening right lower lobe opacity, suspicious for
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo M with h/o aspiration PNA, swallowing difficulty,
parkinsons, who p/w acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. 24
followed by stress EKG negative for ischemia.  Patient extubated
2014-05-29 00:00:00 and is planned to transition to UPMCE Rehab 2014-05-29 00:00:00.
.
1. Respiratory Failure: mixed hypercarbia and hypoxemia likely
from mucus plugging in setting of poor reserve from underlying
restrictive lung disease and LLL pna. He has a history of
hypercarbia possibly due to neuromuscular weakness of
respiratory muscles due to Parkinsons. CTA neg for PE.
.
During his stay the patient has an 8 day antibiotic treatment
for nosocomial PNA with ceftaz and vancomycin as he was found to
have gram positive cocci in pairs in his sputum.  He continued
on his albuterol and ipratroprium nebulizers on nasal cannula. A
neurology consult on 2014-05-29 00:00:00 suggested that the patient should
see neuromuscular in follow up and a decision can be made at
that time whether any further EMG studies are needed but no
further eval at this time with regards to investigating a
neuromuscular source of his hypercarbia.  In addition the
patient had transient pulmonary edema that improved with lasix
admiinstration.
.
While in house, the patient was given an overnight trial of
BIPAP as the patient is chronically hypercarbic with weak
respiratory muscles secondary to Parkinson's disease.  While he
did not tolerate the procedure well we believe that he may
benefit from a repeated trial when he is healthier 2-3 months
discharge.
.
2. Parkinsons: The patient was continued on his home regimen of
Parkisons medication including cabidopa/levidopa and mirapex
while in house
.
3. Glaucoma: The patient was continued on his home regimen of
drops.
.
4. Hypertension: Controlled with lisinopril 20 and lasix as
needed.
.
5. Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis drugs were held during this
admission.  The patient should be reevaulated for possibly
re-starting an anti-osteoporosis regimen as an outpatient.
.
6. Chest pain:  The patient described chest pain but had a
negative EKG.  It improved during his hospital stay and a
spontaneous breathing trial followed by stress EKG to evaluate
for ischemia was negative.
