Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Valium

Attending:Zykia West
Chief Complaint:
SOB/altered mental status c/b hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC
intubation


History of Present Illness:
As per MICU admission note, patient is a 24 yo male with h/o
parkinsons and 3 prior admissions with aspiration pneumonia,
requiring intubation on episode in 2011-05-03 00:00:00, s/p 2011-05-03 00:00:00 placement, who
presents from his NH with decreased oxygen saturation and
altered mental status. History is obtained per NH/hospital
records. Per the patient's wife, the Pt desatted to 82% 2 nights
PTA, returning to normal in the AM prior to admission. Pt
subsequently desatted later in the day. Pt was placed on 02 by
RT with good effect. Giacomin Bieler wife also reported low grade fevers to
about 99.7 (baseline 97.0). Per the NH notes, the patient has
not had a cough, but has been productive of thick clear sputum.
In addition, he has also been more somnolent than normal,
speaking less than usual. Of note, the patient's wife reported
that though the most recent speech and swallow evaluation
recomended nectar thickened liquids and ground solids, he has
been eating a regular diet.
.
In the ED the patient's vital signs were: T:99.4 HR:68 BP:161/83
RR:24 SaO2:100% on 3L. CXR showed LLL infiltrate and UA was
positive. The patient was given 1G Vanco, 500mg Levoflox, 500mg
flagyl, sinemet x2, mirapex x1, and comptan x1.
.
Within an hour after arrival to the floor, the patient was noted
to be somnolent and tired, not responding to commands and
appearing lethargic. ABG was performed, showing a pH 7.22, pCO2
104, pO2 146, HCO3 42. Given concerns for his hypercarbic
respiratory failure, the patient was transferred to the MICU for
urgent intubation.
.
While in the MICU the patient was intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure and was been given vancomycin/zosyn to cover
both aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Mild
hypotension with sedation.
.
ROS: Done on admission: "Per patient's wife, + SOB, weakness,
constipation. - f/c, wt change, visual/hearing changes, HA, n/v,
dysphagia, CP, abd pain, dysuria."

NEURO: Sedated, intubated


Pertinent Results:
EKG: (From MICU) NSR at 68, Left axis, normal intervals, no
concerning ST-Twave abnormalities.
.
CXR 2011-05-03 00:00:00:
CHEST, AP AND LATERAL: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
are stable. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable. There is a left lower lobe
consolidation as well as hazy opacities in the left mid lung and
linear atelectasis. There may be a small left pleural effusion.
Bulky mediastinal adenopathy is again seen. Osseous and soft
structures are unchanged with compression deformity of L1.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for
pneumonia.
.
INDICATION: Respiratory distress, intubation.
.
CXR 2011-05-03 00:00:00:
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with examination of the same day,
12:04 a.m. Endotracheal tube is seen in good position, however,
the balloon appears over- inflated. Bilateral layering pleural
effusions and associated atelectasis. No significant change in
appearance of mediastinum and heavily calcified mediastinal
lymph nodes. No findings to suggest failure. Osseous structures
are unchanged. The extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded
from the study.

IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in good position, however, tube balloon is
over-inflated.
2. Bilateral layering pleural effusions and associated
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo M with h/o aspiration PNA, swallowing difficulty,
parkinsons, granulomatous disease, and HTN, presents with acute
hypercarbic respiratory failure and mental status changes in the
setting of LLL PNA and possible aspiration event. Transferred
now to UPMCE for ongoing management.
.
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely due to a combination
of restrictive lung disease (neuromuscular weakness causing
decreased chest wall compliance) due to Parkinson's plus
pneumonia/aspiration. Likely is chronically hypercarbic. 2011-05-03 00:00:00
also have component of metabolic alkalosis. Opacity in LLL on
2011-05-03 00:00:00. Likely some CHF especially given fluid rescucitation, new
effusions and troponin elevation. Tried to optimize all of these
parameters by treating with antibiotics, diuresis with lasix. He
improved but RSBI's were recurrently high. It was felt that even
when healthy he is a rapid shallow breather (possibly 2011-05-03 00:00:00
Parkinson's?) Pt was extubated on 2011-05-03 00:00:00 after ABG's remained
relatively stable while he was on an Giacomin Bieler for several hours. It
is felt that baseline CO2s are likely in the 50's-60's.  On the
floor, his pneumonia was treated with broad spectrum abx (zosyn
and vanco).
.
2. Pneumonia: Likely aspiration exacerbated by underlying PD and
baseline pulmonary disease. He was treated with vanco/zosyn and
cipro per ID recs (broadened to zosyn given decompensation
requiring intubation). He completed 10 days of vanc/zosyn and
will continue cipro to complete a full 10 days. He will continue
to require aspiration precautions and chest PT.
.
3. Hypotension: Pt became transiently hypotensive following
bolus sedation after intubation, improved with IVF. Subsequently
would have hypotension at night when he was sleeping (BP's into
the 70's) but then would improve to 110's once awakened. BP now
more stable and we were able to add his lisinopril back on.
.
4. Anemia: Pt with 9pt Hct drop early in admission. Baseline
around 33. No active signs of bleeding. By the time of
discharge, the hematocrit had returned to baseline.
.
5. Altered Mental Status: Likely due to PCO2 of 100. Improved
when PCO2 decreased to 70s. Also likely has superimposed
component of infection. At time of discharge, his mental status
was back to baseline according to his wife.
.
6. Elevated Troponins: Cycled and remained flat (0.04-0.10). No
documentation of complaint of chest pain. EKG was unchanged.
.
7. Parkinson's Disease: continued on home regimen during
admission. Neurology was consulted to determine if any changes
in his medications could help with breathing mechanics. Tried
increasing pramipexole but no real improvement seen.
.
8. Glaucoma: continued on home regimen
.
9. FEN: Need to address nutritional status. Patient received
video swallowing study before discharge, was read as silent
aspiration with thin liquids and diet needs to be strictly
nectar thickened liquids and regular food.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with respiratory failure and altered mental
status that was felt to be due to aspiration pneumonia.  You
required intubation and antibiotics.  You were seen by Neurology
who suggested an increase in your Parkinson's meds.  Your
breathing continued to be tenuous at times, and we are concerned
for continued aspiration.  You were discharged to the MACU for
continued monitoring.
