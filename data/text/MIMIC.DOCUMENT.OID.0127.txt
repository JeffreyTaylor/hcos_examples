COURSE IN HOSPITAL:  The patient was admitted for [**Year (4 digits) 1341**]
coiling of right MCA aneurysm.  She was taken to the
operating room on 2012-09-02 00:00:00.  She was placed under
general anesthesia and intubated.  She tolerated the
procedure well with no complications.  The angiogram showed
right MCA aneurysm, confirming the preop diagnosis.  There
was a 4 mm right MCA bifurcation aneurysm that was coiled
using GDC and Matrix coils.  She tolerated the procedure well
without complications.  She was extubated and then brought to
the recovery room.

Postoperatively, she remained afebrile with stable vital
signs.  She was following all commands and doing well.  She
had some slight weakness on the left leg.  She received 3
days of aspirin. The left leg was not in the cerebral territory
that was treated.  Accordingly a spinal MRI was obtained which
was negative.

Her postoperative left leg weakness resolved by postop day
2.  She continued to have gradual improvement until full
recovery was obtained.  Her course in the hospital otherwise
remained uneventful.  She remained afebrile with stable vital
signs.  She was transferred out of the unit on postoperative
day 1.  She was alert and oriented throughout.  She had equal
and symmetric pupils.  She had a symmetric face with full
extraocular movements.  Her tongue was midline.  She had no
drift.  She had full grips.  She had no hematoma.  She had
good distal pulses.

Her lines were removed when she was transferred to the floor.
She was ambulating independently.  Given her left lower
extremity weakness, she was planned for a screening MRI of
the lumbar spine, as well as cervical and thoracic sagittal
images.

The patient was currently stable for discharge home.  She was
doing well and tolerating good PO intake.  She had been
ambulating independently.  She had been voiding independently
without difficulty.  She had been asked to call Dr Puello in 1-
2 weeks.  She was continued on her preop medication.
