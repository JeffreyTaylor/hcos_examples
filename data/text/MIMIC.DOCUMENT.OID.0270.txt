Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Kadijatu Hozey
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, 2012-02-23 00:00:00
removal of retained catheter with left lower extremity
arteriogram and placement of left external iliac covered and
bare metal stents, 2012-02-23 00:00:00

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Vitelli is a 74F with DM and CHF (EF 50-55%) on chronic
steroid treatment who presents with increased shortness of
breath and tachypnea at her living facility.
.
Of note, she was recently hospitalized from 2012-02-23 00:00:00 for a
nonhealing RLE ulcer. She underwent partial thickeness skin
grafting and was treated with a variety of antibiotics:
initially vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl then cefazolin and
zosyn, ultimately discharged on meropenem for Enterobacter UTI.
Prior to discharge, she developed chest discomfort and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction. She also developed increased
pulmonary edema, and the cardiology consult recommended
increasing his lasix to 40mg daily -- though she was discharged
on only 20mg daily.
.
The day prior to admission she developed increasing dyspnea and
tachypnea. Per daughter, but not patient she was coughing as
well, but patient did not have fevers, chills, or sweats.
.
ROS: No PND or orthopnea, leg pain, asymmetry, h/o thrombosis,
chest discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
diarrhea/constipation. Does complain of sore buttocks.
.
She was initially sent to an OSH where she was treated with 40mg
IV lasix, 750mg levofloxacin and sent to UPMCE for further
management.
.
In the ED here, here vitals were T 97.6 P 102 BP 133/81 RR not
recorded O2 83% on room air improving to mid 90's on 2-3L. Her
chest film showed cardiomegaly and UPMCE congestion
consistent with heart failure, though there was a question of L
retrocardiac opacity.
On the floor, she complained of palpitations and dyspnea,
improved at time of interview.

Imaging
2012-02-23 00:00:00 CXR
IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement with central
2012-02-23 00:00:00 congestion is consistent with congestive heart failure.
 Left retrocardiac opacity is present which likely represents a
combination of effusion and atelectasis, however, underlying
pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
.
2012-02-23 00:00:00 TTE
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal
inferior wall and hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral and mid
inferior and inferolateral walls. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
single vessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Cardiac Cath (2012-02-23 00:00:00)
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  There was minimal disease
in the
LMCA.  The LAD was 100% occluded after the diagonals and filled
via
collaterals.  The LCx had 90% and 80% lesions.  The RCA was a
large
vessel with a focal-mid vessel 90% stenosis and a 70% ostial
RPDA
lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP 36 mmHg and RVEDP 14 mmHg.  There was
evidence of
moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with PASP
65
mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.84 L/min/m2.  There
was
evidence of mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with
SBP 146
mmHg.
3. Aborted RCA intervention due to Guide kinking and tangling in
the
left iliac.
4. Unsuccessful attempt at Guide snaring and removal and
referral to
2012-02-23 00:00:00 surgery for percutaneous removal with provisional open
repair
of the vessel.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Moderate-severe pulmonary artery and mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension.
4. Aborted RCA intervention due to Guide entaglement.
5. Unsuccessful attempt at Guide removal with Snare.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF, systolic, acute on chronic:
The patient's presenting symptoms of dyspnea and peripheral
edema were thought to be due to worsening of her CHF. The
123 Any St.itation for this exacerbation may have been development of
atrial fibrillation. There was no evidence for an acute
myocardial infarction, though she continued to have a troponin
leak. She was seen by Dr. Kadijatu Hozey from cardiology who recommended
cardiac catheterization. This was performed on 2012-02-23 00:00:00 and
demonstrated three vessel CAD; medical managment was
recommended.
Her dyspnea improved with diuresis, and she continued her ACEI
and metoprolol. She will follow up with cardiology for further
management of her heart failure.

2. Atrial fibrillation
The patient denied any history of atrial fibrillation, and there
was no documentation of prior atrial fibrillation in the records
available to us. She was anticoagulated with heparin bridging to
warfarin was begun. ***On the day of discharge, the pt's INR was
1.2. She was continued on IV heparin until the time of dischage;
she will be due to her first dose of subq Lovenox around 8PM
this evening.*** Her rate was adequately controlled on oral
metoprolol, and she remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospitalization. Her PCP will adjust her warfarin dosage as
required.

3. Coronary artery disease
She was ruled out for acute MI. Prior stress testing had showed
inferolateral WMAs consistent with single vessel CAD. She
underwent cardiac catheterization on 2012-02-23 00:00:00 that showed three
vessel disease. The cath procedure was complicated by kinking of
the Guide catheter. With assistance from 2012-02-23 00:00:00 surgery, the
catheter was unkinked and removed; a BMS was placed in the left
external iliac artery to repair damage to the intima. She will
continue her aspirin, beta blocker, statin, and ACEi (doses of
these titrated up) and follow up with cardiology for further
management. Plavix was addded to her regimen.

4. DM: The patient continued her home glargine and humalog; the
doses of these were titrated while in the hospital.

5. HTN: The patient's hydralazine and amlodipine were
discontinued. She will continue metoprolol and lisinopril as an
outpatient.

6. RLE ulcer: Diabetic ulcer versus pyoderma gandrenosum per
records. From discussion with outpatient dermatologist (Devito
Vitelli test@mail.com) and rheumatologist (Devito Kadijatu Hozey
test@mail.com) and PCP there was no plan to continue her on long
term sterids, therefore her PO prednisone was tapered. She will
followup  with the test@mail.com service (and dermatology as needed)
for further management of the leg wounds.

Discharge Instructions:
You came into the hospital because of increased shortness of
breath. Your symptoms were likely due to worsening of your heart
failure. You were also found to have an irregular heart rate
(atrial fibrillation). You were treated with medicines to get
rid of excess fluid and keep your heart rate under control, and
your breathing improved. In the hospital, you were evaluated by
the cardiology team who recommended that you undergo cardiac
catheterization to assess the blood supply to your heart. This
study showed XXX

Because of the irregular heart rate, you will need to take a
blood thinner (warfarin) to reduce your risk of stroke. While
taking warfarin, you will need regular blood tests (INR
measurements) to make sure the dose of warfarin is correct.

Please take all of your medications as directed and keep your
followup appointments. It is important that you weigh yourself
every day to make sure you are not retaining too much fluid. It
is also important that you follow a low salt diet, as eating
salty foods will cause you to retain more fluid.

Call Dr.Devito Vitelli office (test@mail.com) and seek medical
attention if you develop:
** increased shortness of breath, chest discomfort, dizziness or
lightheadedness, fevers (temperatures greater than 101.4 F),
shaking chills, sweats, bleeding, black or bloody stools, or any
other symptoms that worry you or your family

Followup Instructions:
Please contact Dr.Devito Vitelli office at (test@mail.com or
(test@mail.com to schedule a follow-up appointment in the next
two to three weeks.
