Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, nontender with a G tube in
place.  Extremities:  Severe muscular atrophy, no edema,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to preop and
holding where he underwent narrow-field laryngectomy.  The
patient tolerated this procedure well.  Please see the
operative note for details.  Chest x-ray postoperatively
revealed a tracheostomy tube in good position with no
pneumothorax.  The patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit on the ventilator.  He was placed on IV
Clindamycin and IV Flagyl.

On postoperative day number one, it was attempted to wean the
patient off the ventilator.  The patient was weaned to CPAP;
however, he was placed back on the ventilator due to
desaturations.  Pink frothy sputum was noted at the site of
the tracheostomy.  Chest x-ray showed a small amount of CHF;
however, the patient's lungs were clear to auscultation and
it was again attempted to wean the ventilator.  Tube feeds
were also started on postoperative day number two at 10 cc
per hour and tube feeds were advanced conservatively to a
goal of 50 cc per hour.

The patient was weaned from the ventilator on postoperative
day number three successfully.  The patient was transferred
from the ICU to a floor bed on postoperative day number five.
His tracheostomy tube was removed and Emerii Hettig Sahakian-Singer
tracheostomy tube was put in its place to support the stoma
until it had matured.  Duoderm was placed in the parastomal
area to protect skin from breakdown.  The patient was placed
in a continuous 02 sat monitor setting.  He was kept n.p.o.
and tube feeds were advanced to goal.

On postoperative day number seven, it was attempted to obtain
a Barium swallow study to test for any esophageal leak;
however, per the Radiology staff, the patient was unable to
cooperate with the Barium swallow in that he was unable to
maintain proper positioning during the study and was unable
to follow commands as to when to swallow the barium contrast.
However, the patient was felt to be stable and was discharged
on postoperative day number seven.  Throughout his hospital
stay, his electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.

Nutrition was consulted for advice regarding the patient's
tube feeds and he remained stable throughout his hospital
stay.
