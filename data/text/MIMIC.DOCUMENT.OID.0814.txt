Brief Hospital Course:

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 3(LIMA->LAD, SVG->LCX, OM1). She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition on Propofol and Neo. She
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated on the postop night. On post-op day one she was
transferred to the floor. Beta blockers and diuretics were
initiated. Diuretics were adjusted towards pre-op weight. Her
chest tubes were removed on post-op day two and epicardial
pacing wires on post-op day three. Following chest tube removal,
a small right-sided apical pneumothorax was seen. On post-op day
four a right-side chest tube was placed with serial chest x-rays
throughout rest of hospital course. Besides from the small
pneumothorax, she made a good recovery. Her chest tube was
removed on post-op day six and the post-pull chest x-ray
revealed no pneumothorax. Physical therapy followed patient
