Attending:Latiya Trubee
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85-year-old female atrial fibrillation, schizophrenia, dementia
presents from nursing home with respiratory distress.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until this AM. At
that time she was found by nursing home staff in respiratory
distress with O2 sats of 70% on RA. EMS was contactDequavius Bogus and she
was started on supplemental oxygen with NRB and O2 sats
responded to 98%. She was also noted to be hot (no document of
temperature) with cough and green sputum. She was transported to
UPMCE ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 99.8, HR 90, BP 171/85, RR 28,
SaO2 98% NRB15L. EKG with Afib RVR to 130s and LVH. SBP 180s.
WBC 16. BNP 12,600. CXR interpreted as concerning for CHF. She
was given nitroglycerin gtt, diltiazem 10mg IV x2, aspirin,
levofloxacin and furosemide 20mg IV x1. Per documents she
received 2L IVF. She was temporarily started on BIPAP however
did not tolerate well with hypotension and tachycardia. This was
discontinued and patient has been stable with vitals at transfer
of HR 105, BP 129/66, RR 26, SaO2 100% NRB.
.
Currently, no distress although neglects left side. No movement
of left side. No respiratory distress.

MICRO:
2012-02-02 00:00:00 Blood culture: pending
.
IMAGING:
2012-02-02 00:00:00 EKG #1: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No 123 Any St.us
tracing available for comparison.

2012-02-02 00:00:00 EKG #2: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 ventricular rate is
slower.

2012-02-02 00:00:00 CXR:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Hyperexpanded lungs, could be due to emphysema.

2012-02-02 00:00:00 CTA Head/Neck:
1. Acute right MCA distribution infarction with acute occlusion
demonstrated within the right middle cerebral artery. No
collateral flow.
2. No evidence of vascular dissection. Mild atherosclerotic
plaque as
detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female with a history of schizophrenia and dementia
who presented in repiratory distress and was found to have a new
MCA stroke. After goals of care discussion with patient's
guardian, she was made comfort measures only, and expired on
2012-02-02 00:00:00.

#. Respiratory Distress: Patient's O2 sats were in high 90s on
NRB on arrival to ED.  She was noted to be in afib with RVR, and
CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema.  Patient was treated
with nitro gtt, diltiazem, aspirin, levofloxacin and furosemide.
BiPAP attempted, but patient did not tolerate well; developed
hypotension and increased tachycardia.  She was admitted to the
ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory
distress. After Code Stroke called on arrival to ICU in setting
of left hemiparesis (see below), and imaging revealed large R
MCA infarct, decision was made to focus on comfort care only.
Patient transferred to floor, where she received morphine as
needed for pain and SOB.
.
#. CVA: On arrival to ICU, patient was noted to have left
hemiparesis.  Code Stroke called, and CT Head/Neck revealed
right MCA infarct. Given the history of recent falls and her
limited pre-stroke functionality, the decision was made not to
give heparin or tPA.  After discussion with the patient's
guardian, it was felt that she would not want to pursue
aggressive treatment given poor prognosis, and patient was made
CMO.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in afib with RVR on
presentation.  She was initially on diltiazem gtt, but this was
discontinued once patient made CMO.
.
#. Rash: Patient noted to have papular rash on erythematous
background on neck and abdomen.  Was felt to be most likely
secondary to a drug rash.  Of note, patient received lasix,
which may have caused reaction as patient has history of sulfa
allergy.  Patient received sarna lotion as needed, as well as
hydrocortisone cream.
.
#. Goals of care: Per discussion with patient's guardian,
patient's code status changed to comfort measures only.  Plan
was for discharge back to skilled nursing facility with hospice,
however patient expired on 2012-02-02 00:00:00 prior to discharge.  Her
guardian was notified, and declined an autopsy.
