2006-02-03 00:00:00 Chest Xray - The heart size is moderately enlarged but
stable. The ascending aorta is very tortuous, unchanged. There
is no significant change in perihilar interstitial opacities
suggesting mild pulmonary edema associated by bilateral pleural
effusions, small to moderate.
.
2006-02-03 00:00:00 U/S liver: Dilated intra- and extra-hepatic biliary
ducts, common bile duct, and pancreatic duct. Tiny hyperechoic
focus in the distal common bile duct, suggesting obstructing
stone versus extrinsic compression. Single enlarged lymph node
in the porta hepatis. Single non-mobile, non-obstructing
gallbladder stone. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. Aul is a 75 yo F with PMH of CAD, HTN, Afib, s/p
pacemaker, severe AS who presents with abdominal pain, rapid
Afib, and chest pain.
.
1)Atrial fibrillation with RVR: She has history of atrial
fibrillation, not 123 Any St.usly treated with anticoagulation,
controlled prior with amiodarone and amlodipine.  She presented
in rapid atrial fibrillation with associated tachypnea requiring
transfer to the MICU.  She was seen by the cardiology consult
team and she was treated with diltiazem and continued on
amiodarone.  In addition, she was started on coumadin, with a
heparin bridge, per cardiology recommendations.  She was not
cardioverted during this admission, but will follow up in one
month as an outpatient to further address whether cardioversion
is indicated.  She did well and was converted to long acting
diltiazem prior to discharge and continued on outpatient regimen
of amiodarone 100mg every other day.  She will follow up with
Dr. Aul as an outpatient.
.
2)Chest pain/CAD: she has h/o stable angina at home, on
aspirin/statin/acei/ntg. Episode of increased chest pain w/
palpatations likely represents demand myocardial ischemia in the
setting of RVR, cardiac enzymes and slight troponin leak also
consistent with this.  Her rate was controlled and her chest
pain resolved.  She was continued on statin and aspirin.
.
3)Abdominal Pain: Initially there was concern for possible CBD
stone and biliary obstruction based on patients symptoms and
ultrasound.  She was evaluated by the ERCP fellow, however no
intervention was undertaken given patients acute cardiac issues.
 Her abdominal pain resolved and she had no LFT abnormalities or
concerns for cholangitis.  Given underlying medical issues,
intervention was deferred given symptom resolution.  She will
follow up as an outpatient, as she did have gall bladder stone
on ultrasound.
.

smoking, living with a smoker or other exposures. She has been
treated for acute infection and COPD flare since admission.  She
completed a course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone during her
admission.  She was also treated with prednisone taper of 30mgx3
days (2006-02-03 00:00:00), 20mg x3days(2006-02-03 00:00:00), 10mg x3 (2006-02-03 00:00:00)days
then stop.  She was also continued on inhaled agents including
fluticasone and salmeterol as well as prn atrovent nebulizers.
Albuterol nebulizers were held because of her tachycardia.
.
4)Aortic stenosis: severe AS (<0.8cm2) and moderate LVH on ECHO,
h/o chronic dizziness but no syncopal episodes at home recently.

.
5)Hypertension: normotensive currently on regimen of dilt and
amio.  Her lisinopril 10mg daily was held during admission
because of sbp <120.
.
6)Dyslipidemia: continue lipitor
.
7)Chronic renal failure: approximately baseline currently, with
Cr 1.

fibrillation such as stroke.  Your amlodipine was stopped.  You
will be taking diltiazem instead.
