History of Present Illness:
46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV 2014-10-27 00:00:00 2014-10-27 00:00:00 blood transfusion, GERD,
admitted with self-reported hemoptysis and CP, also found to be
alcohol intoxicated.  Pt had attended baseball game at which he
drank about 12 beers.  Afterwards, while walking home, pt
suddenly coughed up several tablespoonfuls of blood (per pt's
report to NF, he coughed one T of bright red blood).  At that
time, pt also developed sudden onset L sided CP initiated and
aggravated by breathing, accompanied by SOB.  Pt later reported
that this pain had changed to the R side.  Pt noted no other
additional symptoms.  Pt then called EMS and was brought to ED.

===========================================
Studies:
.
# BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  2014-10-27 00:00:00 6:55 PM
No evidence of DVT.
.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  2014-10-27 00:00:00 5:04 AM
Diffuse air space process, most likely infectious,involving the
right upper, middle and lower lobes. Small mediastinal and right
hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive. Fatty liver.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  2014-10-27 00:00:00 3:30 AM
Diffuse patchy opacity involving the entire right lung. The most
likely etiology is infectious. However, CT scan is recommended
to further assess.
.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  2014-10-27 00:00:00 1:00 PM
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Mild interval improvement in right lung patchy consolidation
and ground- glass opacity, possibly reflecting improving
infectious or inflammatory process; aspiration and pulmonary
hemorrhage are also considered.
3. 3-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. If there is no known
risk factor for pulmonary malignancy, this may be followed up in
one year with chest CT.
.
# ECG Study Date of 2014-10-27 00:00:00  12:10:46 PM
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. ST-T wave
abnormalities which are non-specific. Compared to tracing #1
atrial fibrillation is new.
.
# ECG Study Date of 2014-10-27 00:00:00  12:34:48 PM
Sinus tachycardia with occasional atrial premature beats.
Compared to tracing #2 sinus rhythm has replaced atrial
fibrillation.
.
# SPUTUM Procedure Date of 2014-10-27 00:00:00
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Bacteria, squamous cells, and
scattered pulmonary macrophages.
.
# Cytology Report BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of 2014-10-27 00:00:00
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive bronchial cells, abundant
reactive pulmonary macrophages and inflammatory cells.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  2014-10-27 00:00:00 1:10 PM
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: In comparison with films of 2014-10-27 00:00:00,
the patient has taken a very poor inspiration, which most likely
accounts for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the
heart. Although, the image is somewhat over-penetrated, there is
no evidence of pneumonia. Nevertheless, if there is a
significant clinical concern, a repeat study with better
inspiration and lighter technique would be recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV 2/2 blood transfusion, admitted with
unwitnessed acute-onset hemoptysis and pleuritic CP.
.
# Hemoptysis: DDx included PE and infectious process given
diffuse multilobar opacities in R lung on imaging.  Pulmonary
consult was obtained in the ED.
.
--TB rule-out: Pt was placed in isolation pending TB rule-out
based on reported history of hemoptysis.  One out of three
sputum samples were reported with rare AFB on concentrated
smear.  PPD was placed and was negative.  Bronchoscopy was
performed to assess lungs and airways, returned no bloody fluid,
and found no masses.  BAL results were negative for AFB.  Final
state laboratory results reported negative M. tuberculosis.
.
--Aspiration PNA: Concern existed for possible aspiration PNA
given pt's intoxication on presentation.  Levofloxacin was begun
with goal 10 day course, which was later discontinued given
possible suppressive effects on AFB.  Repeat CXR on 2014-10-27 00:00:00
demonstrated no PNA.
.
--PE rule-out: Concern existed for possibe PE, based on elevated
DDimer, pleuritic chest pain, and episode of atrial fibrillation
which could have been chronic.  Bilateral LENIs were negative
for DVT.  Initial CTA chest had poor contrast timing.  CTA was
repeated and demonstrated no PE.
.
--Autoimmune lung disease: Given isolated R-sided findings, low
suspicion existed for Wegener's or Goodpasture's, but ANCA and
anti-GBM were submitted and, respectively, were negative or
pending on discharge.
.
# Chest pain: Pt presented with pleuritic pain associated with
coughing and deep breathing.  CE were negative and EKG
demonstrated no ischemic changes.  Pt was converted to PO pain
medications and monitored for response.  Pt stated repeatedly
taht .  On 2014-10-27 00:00:00, two hours
.
# Alcohol: Pt had h/o unsuccessful detox, and presented with
ethanol level of 291 on urine toxicology.  Pt was highly
defensive when asked about his alcohol intake, attributing his
drinking to normal pattern with watching TV or a sports game.
Pt placed on CIWA scale with diazepam 10mg PRN, as well as
administered thiamine, folate, and MVI.
.
# Acute renal failure: Pt's Cr was noted to increase acutely
from 1.0 to 2 in a 48-hour time period, returning to 0.8
(baseline) on transfer from the MICU.  As FeNa = 60, this was
attributed to either contrast-induced
.
# During day, pt repeatedly removed O2 NC; when asked why, pt
stated that it "fell off" without him knowing, despite NC being
securely in place.  Overnight, per nursing, pt pulled out IV
which was securely taped, and stated that it had "fallen out" in
the shower.  Second IV was placed, and securely taped with extra
tape per patient request.  Pt pulled out second IV, again
claiming that it also had fallen out on its own.  Later, pt took
off telemetry monitors, placed it in an empty plastic 123 Any St.
box, taped the box closed, and then presented it to the nurse.
When asked by this examiner why pt did this, pt said it had
fallen off in the shower, and that he was "OCD" and didn't want
to lose any parts.  Pt also observed to eat five 123 Any St.
sandwiches after com123 Any St.g his dinner, although he stated to
nursing that he did not have any dinner.  In addition, pt
observed to be throwing objects in room (this had occured about
two nights ago as well).  Pt reported to team later that he had
been thoroughly cleaning his room.
.
# AFib RVR: Pt experienced brief episode of AFib RVR in ED,
although likely 2014-10-27 00:00:00 anxiety and pain.  Pt was monitored on
telemetry and initially continued on metoprolol.  On the floor,
pt had no subsequent incidents of PAF, and anticoagulation was
deferred without evidence of thrombus or PE.
.
# Sedation leading to respiratory depression leading to MICU
admission: Over the course of his hospitalization the patient
has had an escalating pain medication requirement for right
sided chest pain. Per outside records obtained by the team, the
patient was discharged from detox 1.5 months ago after an
admission for EtOH abuse and snorting 240 mg oxycontin daily. He
has been followed on a CIWA scale since admission given his
ongoing alcohol use. He received 80 mg oxycontin UPMCE 2014-10-27 00:00:00 and
2014-10-27 00:00:00 am. He received total of 60 mg prn oxycodone 2014-10-27 00:00:00 and 2014-10-27 00:00:00,
none 2014-10-27 00:00:00. He received 30 mg valium per CIWA on 2014-10-27 00:00:00 and 10 mg
on 2014-10-27 00:00:00, none on 2014-10-27 00:00:00 (purposefully stopped after patient
returned from bronchoscopy with an oxygen requirement). He
received 125 mcg of fentanyl and 5 mg midazolam for the
bronchoscopy on 2014-10-27 00:00:00. Of note, the patient's creatinine
increased from 1.2-2.0 over the last 24 hours.
.
On the morning of MICU admission, the patient was sleepy but
arousable with stable vital signs.  He was found by the nurse to
be somnolent with a RR 8-10, from presumed overdose narcotics.
After consultation with the pain service, he was given 200 mcg
narcan IM followed by repeat doses of IV narcan (total 0.88 mg)
with good result. ABG was 7.29/62/110. The patient had a room
air saturation of 96%, but he would have ongoing intermittent
periods of apnea and would desaturate to 88%. After receiving
narcan he would be a+oX 3 and appropriately answer questions. He
was transferred to the MICU for frequent narcan dosing and
nursing care.

# GERD: Pt was continued on home regimen of PPI.
