male with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension,
and deep venous thrombosis presenting with a fever and lower
extremity pain times one day.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a
fever and hypotension.  He received 6 liters of intravenous
fluids, Ancef, and Unasyn and was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Bilateral deep venous thrombosis.
4.  High cholesterol.
5.  Anal fissure.
6.  Thalassemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Actos, Glucophage, atenolol,
aspirin, and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  ERYTHROMYCIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol.  No tobacco.  No drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, the patient had a temperature of 103.5, his
heart rate was 112, his blood pressure was 109/50, his
respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 100%
on 2 liters.  In general, he was alert and oriented times
three.  In no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the sclerae were anicteric.  The
oropharynx was clear.  No neck stiffness.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first
heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed right lower extremity venous changes.
Pain the medial thigh to the calf.  No rash.  Neurologic
examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  Sensation and strength were 2005-11-26 00:00:00.  Distal pulses were
2+ distally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 12.8.  His hematocrit was 37.1.  Chemistries
were within normal limits.  Urinalysis was normal.  Lactate
was 3.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography angiogram
was negative for a pulmonary embolism.

A chest x-ray was normal.

A right lower extremity ultrasound revealed no deep venous
thrombosis.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient presented with
fevers, hypotension, right lower extremity pain, and septic
physiology responsive to intravenous fluids.

The patient had a negative ultrasound of his right lower
extremity for deep venous thrombosis and a negative computed
tomography angiogram for a pulmonary embolism.  Urinalysis
was normal.  No murmur was heard on cardiac examination, and
a transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.

It was thought that the source of his infection was a right
lower extremity cellulitis.  He was initially started on
Unasyn, as the patient is a diabetic, and gentamicin was
added to cover Pseudomonas.

A right lower extremity magnetic resonance imaging was
performed which showed soft tissue edema.  No focal fluid
collection, and no signs of fasciitis.  General Surgery was
consulted, and vancomycin was added to the regimen for his
cellulitis.

The patient developed a headache without neck stiffness.  A
lumbar puncture was attempted but was unsuccessful.  The
patient's cellulitis continued to improve.  Another line was
placed prior to discharge.  He will be discharged on seven
days of Unasyn and then by mouth Augmentin for seven days.
He was instructed to use compression stockings to reduce the
swelling and improve circulation.

2.  HEADACHE ISSUES:  The patient's headache improved during
his hospital course.  He did not have any associated
photophobia or neck stiffness.  It was thought that this may
have been secondary to discontinuation of his beta blocker
because of his low blood pressures.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient to follow up
with Dr. Niebla on Wednesday, 2005-11-26 00:00:00.

MAJOR SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Mid line
placement on 2005-11-26 00:00:00.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Unasyn 3 gram intravenously q.6h. (times seven days).
2.  Augmentin 500/125 one tablet by mouth three times per day
(times seven days); starting in one week.
3.  Normal saline flushes 10 cc before and after each Unasyn
dose.
3.  Heparin flushes 2 cc after each Unasyn dose.
