HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
patient of Dr. 123 Any St.es) **] with
known mitral valve and 3-vessel disease referred for cardiac
catheterization to evaluate his aortic valve.

The patient had never experienced chest pain or shortness of
breath in the past.  In about 2007-09-14 00:00:00, the patient had an
exercise treadmill test followed by a cardiac catheterization
which showed 50% proximal left anterior descending artery,
60% distal left anterior descending artery, 40% proximal
right coronary artery, 70% mid right coronary artery, and
some degree of mitral regurgitation which was subsequently
followed by an echocardiogram in 2007-09-14 00:00:00.  The patient
had an exercise tolerance test which showed inferior and
septal ischemia with an ejection fraction of 65%.

Cardiac catheterization done on 2007-09-14 00:00:00 showed 60%
circumflex, proximal 90% distal circumflex, 80% proximal
right coronary artery, with an 80% distal right coronary
artery, 90% posterior descending artery, 70% left main, and
40% proximal left anterior descending artery, and 70% mid
left anterior descending artery.

The patient had an echocardiogram done by a local
cardiologist which showed a question of significant aortic
stenosis that was difficult to assess due to calcification.
Catheterization done on the day of admission demonstrated an
aortic valve area of 2.0 cm2, with 16 mmHg of pressure, and a
wedge pressure of 8.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient's past medical history is
significant for)
1.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
2.  Cyst on spine at L5; requiring surgery.
3.  Moderate ventricular ectopy.
4.  History of pancreatitis in 2007-09-14 00:00:00.
5.  Knee repair.
6.  Achilles tendon repair.
7.  Rotator cuff repair.
8.  Cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission
included)
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Zocor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Vitamin E 400 International Units by mouth once per day.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on admission revealed his sodium was 140, potassium was 4,
chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was
33, creatinine was 1.8, and his blood glucose was 77.  The
patient's white blood cell count was 8, his hematocrit was
37.1, and his platelets were 235.  His INR was 1.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The following morning,
the patient was brought to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two.  Please
see the Operative Report for full details.

In summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft
times two with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior
descending artery and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient was in a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 84, a mean arterial blood pressure of
94, central venous pressure of 9, on Neo-Synephrine at 1
mcg/kg per minute and propofol at 20 mcg/kg per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He was weaned from his cardioactive intravenous medications.
His anesthesia was reversed.  He was weaned from his
ventilator and successfully extubated.

On the morning of postoperative day one, the patient was
scheduled to go to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory
because he was incompletely revascularized in the operating
room due to a .....................

That procedure was postponed until postoperative day two, at
which time the patient went to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory and underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his obtuse marginal lesion.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable throughout this period.  He
was returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
following his percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
Please see the catheterization report for full details.  He
remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit overnight.

On postoperative day three, the patient was transferred UPMCE
Two for continued postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.  Also, on postoperative day three, the
patient's chest tubes were discontinued.  It was noted
following a chest x-ray after the removal of the chest tubes
that the patient had a small right apical pneumothorax.  On a
repeat chest x-ray, this pneumothorax was stable.  A further
chest x-ray the following morning also showed a resolving
right apical pneumothorax.

The patient continued to progress in his activity on the
floor.  On postoperative day five, the patient experienced a
fall while he was in the bathroom.  Following the fall, the
patient was examined.  He had no lacerations.  He had a small
ecchymotic area above his left eye noted.  Neurologically,
the patient was fully intact, and no further workup was felt
to be needed.

On postoperative day six, it was decided that the patient
would be stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation on
the following morning.  So, on postoperative day seven, the
patient was transferred to rehabilitation.  At the time of
transfer, the patient's condition was good.

His physical examination revealed vital signs with a
temperature of 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was
100 (in sinus rhythm), his blood pressure was 98/64, and his
respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was 97% on
room air.  Weight preoperatively was 79.2 kilograms.
Discharge weight was 80.3 kilograms.  Neurologic examination
revealed the patient was alert and oriented times three.  The
patient moved all extremities.  His followed commands.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  A 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur.  The sternum was stable.  Incision with Steri-Strips
opened to air, clean and dry.  Extremity examination revealed
the extremities were warm and well perfused with no edema.
Left saphenous vein graft site with a small amount of
serosanguineous drainage at the base of his thigh.  Left
upper eyelid with ecchymosis.

Laboratory data revealed his white blood cell count was 7.2,
his hematocrit was 27.1, and his platelets were 142.  Sodium
was 138, potassium was 4.6, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was
27, blood urea nitrogen was 32, creatinine was 2, and his
blood glucose was 88.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
2.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day (times seven days).
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth once per day (times
seven days).
4.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Niferex 150 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Simvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.

rehabilitation in 123 Any St..

Lithgow two weeks after discharge from rehabilitation.
