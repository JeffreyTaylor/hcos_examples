Studies:
2005-11-25 00:00:00 EKG - Possible atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing
of 2005-11-25 00:00:00 the atrial flutter is now present.

2005-11-25 00:00:00 EKG - Narrow complex tachycardia, possibly atrial
flutter. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2005-11-25 00:00:00 no change.

2005-11-25 00:00:00 CTA Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Severe emphysema with stable noncalcified lung nodules since
2005-11-25 00:00:00. Followup study in six months is recommended to
document stability.
3. Mildly distended colon with air-fluid levels without evidence
of pneumatosis or wall edema.
4. Airspace opacities in the dependent portions of both lungs
may represent atelectasis or consolidation.

2005-11-25 00:00:00 CXR:
FINDINGS: AP view of the chest in upright position was obtained.
Low lung
volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits. The aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Emphysematous changes are
again noted. Congestion of the pulmonary vasculature with
increased interstitial markings consistent with mild edema.
Bibasilar consolidations vs atelectasis. An NG tube is seen with
the tip within the stomach.

2005-11-25 00:00:00 EKG - Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared to
the 123 Any St.us tracing the rhythm has changed.

2005-11-25 00:00:00 EKG - Narrow complex tachycardia, probably atrial
flutter with rapid ventricular response. Compared to the
123 Any St.us tracing the rhythm has changed.

2005-11-25 00:00:00 EKG - Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing the rate is slower and the
rhythm is now sinus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Burtt is a 68 year old male with a history of PE, COPD,
and paroxysmal afib admitted with watery diarrhea, RVR, and
hypotension.

1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response -
The patient was hypotensive and tachycardic on presentation and
received 3L IVF.  When he arrived in the MICU levophed was
stopped and the patient was started on a diltiazem gtt for afib
with rvr.  The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm
overnight and was switched to diltiazem 30 mg PO QID on 2005-11-25 00:00:00 and
transferred to the general medicine floor.  On the morning of
2005-11-25 00:00:00 the patient went back into afib with rvr and then into
atrial flutter with sustained heart rate in the 140s.  Oral
diltiazem was increased from 30 to 60 mg PO QID with no effect.
Diltiazem 15 mg IV was given and the patient's SBP dropped from
140 to 98 without any change in the heart rate.  IVF were given
and later on in the day PO diltiazem was increased to 90 mg PO
QID.  Overnight the patient's aflutter gradually slowed and
early in the morning of 2005-11-25 00:00:00 the patient spontaneously converted
back to normal sinus rhythm.  He was put back on his home dose
of diltiazem SR 240 mg daily.

2. Diarrhea - On presentation the patient was started on flagyl
empirically for C. diff. given his recent health care and
antibiotic exposures.  Stool was sent for C. diff.  The
patient's diarrhea resolved quickly and flagyl was stopped on
2005-11-25 00:00:00.  Stool tests for C. diff and other enteric pathogens were
ultimately negative.  The patient's diarrhea may have been
secondary to recent antibiotic exposures or to something in the
salad that he had eaten several hours prior to its onset.

3. Anticoagulation - Warfarin was held on admission given a
supratherapeutic INR.  It was restarted at 6 mg daily on 2005-11-25 00:00:00
and increased to 8 mg daily (the patient's regular home dose) on
2005-11-25 00:00:00.  INR was 2.8 on the day of discharge and the patient was
instructed to follow-up with his UPMCE clinic.

4. Hypertension - The patient's home antihypertensives were
initially held on admission secondary to hypotension.  The
patient remained normotensive on diltizem alone.  Lisinopril was
started on discharge and the patient was instructed to speak
with his physician about when to restart hydrochlorothiazide.

5. COPD - The patient was restarted and discharged on a steroid
taper.  Advair and spiriva were continued per the patient's home
regimen.  There was no evidence of pneumonia on discharge,
however, the patient was instructed to seek medical attention if
he developed a fever or worsening cough.

6. Hypoxia: The patient had some new hypoxia in the MICU, likely
secondary to mild pulmonary edema from fluid resuscitation.  He
diuresed on his own and his hypoxia resolved by discharge.

7. Anemia - The patient has a normocytic anemia with a
hematocrit of 33 (stable since 2005-11-25 00:00:00).  The etiology of which is
unclear etiology.  Colonoscopy in 2005-11-25 00:00:00 did show a polyp.  Stool
guiacs were negative.

8. Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his home
regimen of atorvastatin.

9. BPH - The patient was continued on his home regimen of
finasteride and flomax.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
1. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response
2. Paroxysmal atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
3. Diarrhea

Secondary Diagnoses:
1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia


Discharge Condition:
Stable, satting in the low to mid 90s on room air, in normal
sinus rhythm with a heart rate in the 70s.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of diarrhea,
low blood pressure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid heart
rate.  You received diltiazem through an IV in the ICU and your
heart went back into a normal rhythm.  Your heart went back into
atrial flutter for awhile, but again went into a normal rhythm
when you diltiazem dose was increased back to your home regimen.
 You should follow-up with Dr. Aswath Hertog and will likely need to
have an ablation of the electrical pathway causing this fast
heart rhythm.

Your diarrhea resolved on its own.  Tests of your stool did not
show any evidence of infection.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. Please also stop your hydrochlorothiazide and discuss with
Dr. Burtt if and when you should resume it.
2. You were also started on a prednisone taper for your COPD.
Please continue this taper as prescribed.  Please see your
physician immediately if you develop a temperature greater than
100.4.

Please follow-up with the physicians as directed below.  You
will also need to follow-up with your UPMCE clinic.

Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you
develop fevers, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, a
rapid heart rate, or any other concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your PCP, 123 Any St. on
Tuesday, 2005-11-25 00:00:00 at 9:00 am.  Her office phone number
is test@mail.com.

Please follow-up with your cardiologist Dr. Aswath Hertog on
