History of Present Illness:
85 yo M w/ PMH of bladder ca, CAD, HTN who is transferred from
OSH for concern for urosepsis.  Pt presented to OSH day prior to
admission here with shaking chills and altered mental status. Pt
reports he has had urinary incontinece over the past few days
which is abnormal for him, denies any dysuria.  He reports
awaking in the middle of the night with shaking chills and does
not recall what else happed but that his girlfriend must have
taken him to the Braedon Demeo. ON arrival to the OSH he was febrile to
103.3 and given 1 dose of tylenol.  UA at the OSH was positive
for UTI. His BP dropped to 86/46 and he was given 3-4L of fluids
with improvement in BP to 101/48.  They did a head CT for
concern of his altered mental status in the setting of
anticoagulation which was per report negative. He was
transferred here for further care given that this is where he
has all of his providers.

On arrival to the UPMCE ED he was febrile at 102.5 rectally and
was given 650mg of tylenol.  He was initially hemodyanmially
stable, however his BP did drop down transiently into the 70s
and he was given 2L bolus of fluid with good response in his BP
and was stable in the 110s prior to transfer to the floor.
Repeat blood and urine cultures were performed and he was
admitted for possible urosepsis.

On arrival to the MICU the patient is sleepy and complains of
some chronic left sided pain. He denies any recent suprapubic
pain, nausea, vomiting, flank pain.  He has not had a UTI since
2011-08-12 00:00:00 and he denies any hematuria, or changes in his urine color.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pyelonephritis or perinephric focal fluid
collections.  Note
that ultrasound has a relatively low sensitivity for detection
of
pyelonephritis (in the absence of significant phlegmon or
abscess).
2. 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm anechoic structure, likely representing a
small renal
cyst within the lower pole of the left kidney.
3. Enlarged prostate.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo M w/ PMHx of bladder tumors, prior episode of bacterial
prostatitis, CAD s/p CABG X2, AF, CKD, HTN who was transferred
from OSH with urosepsis and found to have GNR bacteremia who was
stabilized in the MICU with fluid resucitation and antibiotics
and continued to do well on floor after switching to oral
antibiotics
.
#Urosepsis likely secondary to prostatitis with altered mental
status
Patient has known bladder tumors and noted increased urinary
urgency and incontinence in the few days prior to admission. He
met sepsis criteria at the OSH with fever, tachypnea,
leukocytosis and positive UA which ultimately grew out EColi and
GNR bacteremia.  He was started on zosyn at the OSH and this was
switched to cefepime initially in the MICU.  His cultures at the
UPMCE ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3027**] Demeo Hospital) were pending at the time of
discharge and despite multiple calls (including after discharge
on 2011-08-12 00:00:00)they were never faxed to UPMCE.  I will send a note
to the patients PCP alerting her of the situation.  At UPMCE the
patient grew out pan sensitive e. coli in his urine.
Surveillance blood cultures were no growth to date, his WBC
normalized and he was afebrile.  His mental status was back to
baseline on the medical floors.  In addition, his PSA was
checked which was elevated.  After conversations with Dr. Demeo
(the patients Urologist) and negative renal US, bacterial
prostatitis was thought to be the ultimate source of the
patients infection.  The patient will be sent home on 3 weeks of
cipro for this.  An interaction with Coumadin was noted, but
this was thought to be the best drug that concentrates in the
prostate and covers the patients e. coli.
.
# left leg pain
The patient describes about a 1 month history of left leg pain
in a radicular pattern radiating from his back down his leg.
His pain is improved with unloading of the spine (bending
forward) and is somewhat consistent with spinal stenosis.  We
also considered sciatic nerve pain as a possibility.  PT worked
with the patient and they indicated he was safe to go home with
a wheeled walker, a home safety evaluation and consideration of
home vs. outpatient PT.  The patient was sent home with low dose
oxycodone (tolerated this in house with good relief) and a bowel
regimen.  He was advised to consider follow up with a
Orthopedist for consideration of further management with
injection vs. surgery.
.
#Afib:
Patient is rhythm controlled with amiodarone. This was continued
while he was inpatient and his Coumadin was increased to 3 mg
QD.  Further titration as an outpatient will likely be necessary
given that he will be on cipro for 3 weeks.  His PCP Demeo. Demeo
will follow his INR and he was given a prescription to have this
re-checked in the next several days.
.
# Transitional Issues:
-please follow up with the patient blood cultures from 123 Any St. which were not yet speciated
but grew GNR
-please also note that the patient has pending blood cultures
from UPMCE on 2011-08-12 00:00:00 and 2011-08-12 00:00:00 which are pending that the time of
the discharge summary and they need follow up
-Follow up with PCP Demeo 2011-08-12 00:00:00 weeks and have INR checked prior to
visit
