History of Present Illness:
The paitent is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding history of
HIV/AIDS who presented to the ED after a week long history of
high grade fevers and worseing dyspnea with exertion. The
patient was diagnosed in 2013-12-18 00:00:00 with HIV and has been on and off
HAART therapy since that time. Most recently, he was on steady
treatment for 3 years until this spring when he decided to take
a self decided medication holiday. He reports he has not taken
HAART medications in about 6 months. About 2-3 months ago the
patient also started having watery diarrhea intermittently 2013-12-18 00:00:00
times weekly. About one and a half weeks ago, he started
noticing high fevers and night sweats. The diarrhea worsened and
instead of having it on and off, it became constant. The fevers
also continued to worsen and peaked at a temp of 103.6 today,
the morning of his admission. Two days prior to admission he
started noticing shortness of breath with simple tasks such s
climbing a few stairs at home. He also describes a
non-productive dry cough and some chest "tightness" associated
with this increased work of breathing. He could barely walk from
the kitchen back and forth to the couch due to his dyspnea. He
has also noticed daily headaches. He denies neck
stiffness/rigidity, photophobia or any new skin rashes. He
describes some mild blurry vision when he would try to focus on
123 Any St. but this would subside after a minute or so. He now
complains of diffuse weakness and lightheadedness today. He
denies any syncope. Of note, he has lost about 25 pounds over
the last couple months which he attributes to a decreased
a123 Any St.e and his diarrhea issues.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 99.4, BP 97/56, P 98, R 22, 85%
on RA with only a slight improvement to 91% on 2L. The patient
received 1000 mg IV  Vancomycin, 750 mg PO Levofloxacin, and 40
mg oral 123 Any St.. He was ordered for Pentamidine 225 mg but
did not receive it in the ED. An ABG was done and showed a low
pO2 of 72. CXR showed multiple small patchy opacities
bilaterally which were immediately concerning for PCP.
.
On the floor, the patient continued to feel short of breath. He
was eventually comfortable on 2013-12-18 00:00:00 L NC O2 but noticed he got
very winded walking to and from the bathroom. He denied any
nausea, vomiting. No abdominal pain. No diarrhea on day of
admission. He still felt weak "all over" and had diffuse muscle
aches. No headaches on arrival to floor. The patient had an
acute exacerbation of his shortness of breath with associated
tachypnea and tachycardia soon after admission to the medical
floor. This acute episode of respiratory distress was soon after
an induced sputum sample and thus, likely due to associated
bronchospasms. The patient was hypoxic on labs and was therefore
transferred to the MICU for a brief one day stay in order to
watch his airway closely while he improved. Fortunately, he
improved significantly following nebulizer treatments and high
flow supplemental oxygen. He did not require any intubations. He
was transferred back to the general medical floor once he was
more hemodynamically stable and breathing comfortably on 4L
oxygen via nasal cannula with oxygen saturations >95%
consistently.

IMAGING:
2013-12-18 00:00:00 CT CHEST: The airways are patent to the subsegmental
level. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities are more
confluent in the bases, greater on the right side. There is no
pleural or pericardial effusion. Cardiac size is top normal. The
aorta is normal in caliber. There are no mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary enlarged lymph nodes. Tiny calcification is in the LAD.
There are no bone findings of malignancy.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. The upper
abdomen is unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Findings are likely due to
PCP Amenia Knotts. Differential diagnosis includes viral pneumonia.
.
2013-12-18 00:00:00 CXR : Since yesterday, multifocal bilateral opacities,
mostly bibasilar, are unchanged, could be due to PCP pneumonia
in the clinical context. There is no pleural effusion. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged,
with a top- normal heart size, likely due to lower lung volumes.
.
OTHER STUDIES:
2013-12-18 00:00:00 EKG: rate 80s,Sinus rhythm. Non-diagnostic inferior Q
waves. Prominent QRS voltage but probably normal for age. Since
the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2013-12-18 00:00:00 the premature beat is no longer
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. Knotts is a 43-year-old male with a longstanding
history of HIV/AIDs who was admitted with a CD4 count of 16 and
1 week of worsening fevers, cough and dyspnea and found to have
sputum samples and imaging consistent with an acute PCP
pneumonia episode.
.
# Hypoxemia/Dyspnea: The patient explains feeling very fatigued
with nightly fevers in the 101-103 range for 1 week leading up
to his hospital admission. He began having chest "tightness" and
progressive shortness of breath about 3 days prior to ED
presentation. The day of admission he had an acute worsening of
his shortness of breath and hypoxia which prompted his transfer
to the MICU. This was most likely related to underlying PCP
alongside acute bronchospasm from sputum induction given the
temporality of his symptoms which occured shortly after an
induced sputum sample was collected. He responded very well to
albuterol nebulizer therapy and fortunately, never required
intubation. To protect against possible inflammatory response
from anti-PCP treatment steroids were initiated and
appropriately increased from 40 daily to 40 UPMCE. UPMCE was
again tapered after 4-5 days down to qdaily dosing. He was
continued on Pentamidine 225 IV daily in place of Bactrim given
his allergy to sulfa medications. Later in his hospital course
he was transitioned to 300mg PO Trimethoprim three times daily
along with 100mg daily Dapsone for PCP Amenia Knotts. He was continued
on albuterol nebulizers as needed for the remainder of his
hospital course and he was continued on supportive oxygen via
nasal cannula with oxygen saturation goal of >95%. He was
gradually weaned down from 4-5L/min to 2L oxygen on nasal
cannula by the time of discharge. Mr. Knotts desaturations
were clearly most marked with any exertion. Walking oxygen
saturation levels improved very slowly but he was still dropping
to 88-90% after only 2013-12-18 00:00:00 yards of ambulation 1-2 days prior to
discharge. Therefore, he was set up with home oxygen
therapy/continuous flow at 2L to use at home while he continued
to recuperate.  He was set up for close follow-up with his PCP,
Knotts. Knotts on 2013-12-18 00:00:00.
.

# Pneumocystis jirovecii/ PCP Amenia Knotts: The patient had a
sputum sample done 2013-12-18 00:00:00 which was positive for Pneumocystis
jirovecii. Moreover, the patient's CXR and CT revealed bilateral
infiltrates consistent with the diagnosis and he also had a
typical LDH elevation to further corroborate the diagnosis. Mr.
Knotts fevers, shortness of breath/hypoxia, and recent cough
were all Knotts to his PCP. Amenia Knotts was more prone to infection
with a low CD4 count of 16 and his worsening immunocompromised
state was likely directly linked to his HAART medication
non-compliance over the last 6 months. As above, he was
continued on albuterol nebulizers PRN along with Pentamidine and
then TMP/Dapsone combination for treatment of his PCP.
Amenia Knotts was eventually tapered from 40mg b.i.d. to 40mg once
daily for 5 days with a plan to then taper to 20mg daily for 10
days. He was continued on low flow supplemental oxygen via nasal
cannula and weaned down to 2L by time of discharge. Mr. Knotts
shortness of breath and cough gradually improved throughout his
hospital course. Lung exam at time of discharge revealed much
less prominent diffuse rhonchi than his admission presentation.
He also appeared less fatigued and was breathing much more
comfortably in lower O2 requirements.
.
#Diarrhea: Given immunocompromised state with CD4 count of 16
other infectious etiologies were considered with a wide
differential. Mr. Knotts recent fevers up to 103 degrees were
likely from his PCP. Amenia Knotts, given his noncompliance with his
HIV therapy for 6 months, the team opted to collect multiple
stool studies. Per OMR records, he had been seen in 2013-12-18 00:00:00-2013-12-18 00:00:00
for chronic diarrhea and dyspeptic symptoms and he has a past
history of ulcers in the upper third of his esophagus. Biopsies
back in 2013-12-18 00:00:00 were negative for HSV and CMV. On this admission he
had an extensive workup for his diarrhea and stool studies
tested negative for all ova/parasites, cryptospora,
microsporidium, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and
giardia. Viral stool studies and C.difficile studies were also
negative. Mr. Knotts Knotts his 25lb weight loss over the
past 5 months to his intermittent chronic diarrhea (2013-12-18 00:00:00
episodes/week) and decreased a123 Any St.e. As of 2013-12-18 00:00:00 his
diarrhea symptoms tapered and he proceeded to have 2 days of
constipation which was relieved with some stool softeners. By
the time of discharge he had been having normal, daily, well
formed bowel movements for 3 days and his diarrhea appeared to
have at least temporarily ceased. During the initial days of his
hospital stay he was given some supplemental IVFs as needed, but
he continued to have excellent PO fluid intake so IVFs weren't
needed. He was encouraged to follow up with his PCP as an
outpatient if his diarrhea returned for possible imaging and
additional workup.
.
# HIV/AIDS: Mr. Knotts  CD4 count of 16 was largely a result
of his noncompliance with HAART medications x 6 months. After
admission he was restarted on ritonavir, atazanavir, and
truvada. He had complaints of dysphagia with his ritonavir
tablet and he was switched to the elixir form which he was able
to tolerate much better. He was continued on this same regimen
at time of his discharge. He was also continued on Laureli Kink
prophylaxis with Azithromycin and PCP treatment with
Trimethoprim/Dapsone daily with a plan for 21 days total
therapy.
.
# Weight loss: The patient reports a 25lb weight loss over the
past 4-5 months. This is likely multifactorial in origin
including diarrhea, infection, and noncompliance with his AIDS
medications. Stool studies were all unremarkable and he had no
evidence of GI bleeding. He was encouraged to consider
supplemental shakes at time of discharge. He will continue to
monitor his weight loss with his primary care physician as an
outpatient.
.
#Transaminitis: Mr. Knotts had a slight increase in his AST /ALT
enzymes which were Knotts to restarting his HAART regimen in
conjunction with his TMP therapy. Dapsone can also raise LFTs.
ALT peaked at 104 and AST reached a high of 55. He had no
evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or RUQ tenderness on physical
exam. No abdominal pain or jaundice. ALP remained within normal
limits.  He will continue to have this issue followed as an
outpatient.
.
# Dysphagia: On exam, the patient had yellowish patches on the
posterior aspect of tongue consistent with thrush. His dysphagia
gradually improved with a combination of oral fluconazole
therapy and daily nystatin swish and swallow for suspected
Amenia Knotts esophagitis. CMV esophagitis and HSV were also on the
differential, especially since the patient has a known history
of CMV esophagitis. After rapid response to fluconazole it was
clear that he had a fungal infection. By time of discharge he
had scant patches and near complete resolution of his symptoms.
He was asked to continue his Diflucan and Nystatin for a total
of 2 weeks.
.

# Anemia: Mr. Knotts had no sudden hematocrit drops or any
evidence of acute bleeding during his hospital course. Based on
his high ferritin and low TIBC his anemia is mainly from chronic
disease. Iron levels were WNL and he had a borderline MCV at 80.
Folate and Vitamin B12 deficiency were considered but follow-up
lab testing revealed both Vitamin B12/folic acid levels were
within normal limits.
.
#Hyperkalemia: A few days into his hospital stay he had a slight
elevation from K 5 to 5.3 which was most likely a side effect of
his trimethoprim therapy which can raise potassium levels. He
was given Kayexalate 30g x1 on 2013-12-18 00:00:00 and patient had 2 loose BMs
with a drop in his K down from 5 to 4 range. EKGs were all
unremarkable and he had no repeat hyperkalemia bouts.
.
# Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Electrolytes were
monitored and repleted daily as needed. He was continued on a
regular PO diet with nutritional supplements and additional
hydration with IVFs as needed.
.
# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin was given for DVT
prevention, and H2 blocker was provided for GI protection. Bowel
regimen was given for a few days later in his hospital stay for
a few days of constipation.
.
The patient was maintained as a full code status for the
entirety of his hospital stay and communication occurred on a
daily basis directly with the patient to update him on his
health status and progress. He was set up for close follow-up
with his primary care physician at the time of discharge.
