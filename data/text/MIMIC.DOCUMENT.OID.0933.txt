History of Present Illness:
54 y.o. male with PMHx of ESRD (thought to be 2010-01-24 00:00:00 HTN) s/p
deceased donor kidney transplant in 2010-01-24 00:00:00, HTN and gout who
presented to the ER with right leg swelling and pain x 3 days.
He denies any recent injury or prolonged travel and has not had
problems with leg swelling in the past. He additionally denies
SOB or CP.  In the ED, patient was evaluated and noted to have a
tender, erythematous right LE with a right calf measuring 43cm
compared to 38 cm of the left calf. Bilateral LE dopplers were
performed and showed a DVT in the right common femoral to the
calf veins. Given his kidney disease, renal transplant was
consulted in the ED and felt there were no active transplant
issues. Patient was noted to be guaiac positive and does have a
history of a colonic polyp, found in 2010-01-24 00:00:00. A Heparin gtt was
started and the patient was admitted for further management.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Eveleen Lipnicki scale, color,
Doppler sonIyauna Dicaprio of the right and left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins were performed. There is
deep vein thrombosis extending from the right common femoral
vein to the calf veins. There is no deep vein thrombosis within
the left lower extremity. Respiratory phasicity is preserved in
the left common femoral vein.
.
RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND: A transplant kidney is seen in the
right lower quadrant, measuring 12.4 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis or renal calculi. The main renal artery and main
renal vein are patent with normal waveforms. Resistive indices
in the upper, mid, and lower poles are 0.66, 0.67, and 0.71,
respectively. The bladder is well distended without abnormality.
IMPRESSION: Normal renal transplant ultrasound. Patent
vasculature with normal RIs.
.
2010-01-24 00:00:00: IVC filter placement
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of retrievable Gunther tulip
IVC filter via left common femoral vein approach. If indicated,
this filter can be removed within two weeks of placement.
.

2010-01-24 00:00:00: Lung V/Q scan:
IMPRESSION: Normal lung scan. No evidence of PE
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 54 year old male s/p renal transplant for ESRD
(2010-01-24 00:00:00) without any identified risk factors for deep venous
thrombosis. He presented to the hospital with right lower
extremity swelling and tenderness for 3 days. A duplex
ultrasound was performed in the ED and he was found to have a
right femoral vein DVT that extended to his popliteal vein.
.
DVT: Patient had no clear risk factors for DVT and no prior
history of DVTs. Patient was started on a weight-based heparin
drip at admission. He was treated, with good effect, with
oxycodone and acetominophen for pain. Because of the size of the
thrombus and the clinically significant threat of pulmonary
embolus, an IVC filter was placed by interventional radiology on
2010-01-24 00:00:00. No contast was used for placement because of
patient's renal insufficiency and it was placed via ultrasound
guidance. Anticoagulation with heparin was held for procedures:
filter placement and also endoscopy (see below). The heparin
goal was a PTT 60-80. Patient was continued on heparin until
2010-01-24 00:00:00 when he passed a grossly bloody stool in the morning.
At that time he was tachycardic to 130's but continued to
maintain his blood pressure around 130 systolic. His HCT on
2010-01-24 00:00:00 was 29.7 On the morning of 2010-01-24 00:00:00 as 26.6. With
this HCT drop, hemodynamic change, gross blood in his stool, and
a single access point for fluids, it was decided that patient
would be better served in a monitored setting so he was
transferred to the intensive care unit.
.
Hypercoaguable workup so far has showed increased B2
microglobulin which is nonspecific and frequently elevated in
patient's with chronic renal insufficiency. Also increased
Thrombin time which is expected given heparin anticoagulation.
Patient should follow up as an outpatient with the coagulation
clinic.
Futher work-up was sent off and pending at time of discharge.
His protein C level was elevated while protein S was within the
normal range. He was Eveleen Lipnicki negative. Beta-2-glycoprotein 1
antibodies (IGA, IGM, IGG) and factor V leiden were pending at
time of discharge.
.
Extensive discussion took place between the primary medical
team, primary care physician, Iyauna Dicaprio team, and interventional
radiology team regarding removal of the patient's IVC filter, as
it was initially placed as a temporary filter. The patient was
brought down to IR to have the filter removed on 2010-01-24 00:00:00,
however at that time it was found that the filter had
thrombosed. He was then transferred to the [**Year (4 digits) **] to receive 24
hours of local TPA via a central line that was placed in IR.
Because of the risks involved in removal of the IVC including
possible showering of emboli and difficulty removing due to
fibrosis, the decision was made to leave the IVC filter in
place, and as a result it will become a permanent IVC filter.
.
The patient was started on Coumadin on and his levels were
carefully monitored given the potential interaction with his
transplantation medications. He was discharged when his INR was
therapeutic. He was not a candidate for lovenox given his renal
insufficency. He was encouraged to elevated his leg when
possible and wore Eveleen Lipnicki Dicaprio stocking to help with the edema. He was
instructed to follow up with his primary care physician's office
for weekly INR checks.
.
2. Guaiac Positive Stool: Patient was noted to have guaiac
positive stool in the emergency room. A colonoscopy completed in
2010-01-24 00:00:00 showed a nonbleeding polyp/adenoma. His hematocrit was
noted to be down from 40 in 2010-01-24 00:00:00, but had been as low as 31
prior. Upper and lower endoscopy on 2010-01-24 00:00:00 demonstrated an
EG juntion ulcer which was biopsied, as well as three
non-bleeding polyps in colon that were removed. These are a
possible source of the initial guaiac positive result. Patient
passed a grossly bloody stool on 2010-01-24 00:00:00 and became hemodynamically
unstable at that time. He was transferred to the intensive care
unit at that time for further management, where he received two
units of packed red blood cells, and an additional 1 unit two
days later. A repeat colonoscopy was completed on 2010-01-24 00:00:00
which demonstrated no sources of bleeding. He had no further
episodes of bleeding and his HCT remained stable. It was felt
the bleeding was from the biospy/polyp removal sites which
resolved with time.
.
He was maintained on a twice daily proton pump inhibitor, which
he should continue to take.
.
The biopsy obtained was positive for H. Pylori, for which
treatment was initiated. Due to interactions with his
cyclosporine, patient was started on 2010-01-24 00:00:00 with a regimen of
flagyl and tetracycline also with peptobismul to complete 14 day
course.
.
3 ESRD s/p transplant: Patient was continued on his
immunosuppression regime and maintained a stable creatinine
throughout his hospitalization, at this baseline of 1.7-2.0. An
US study of the graft showed good flow, normal functioning
kidney. Patient was followed by the transplant renal team. He
was continue Cyclosporine, Imuran and Prednisone. His
medications were renally dosed, and he received intravenous
fluids with bicarbonate prior dye received while attempt was
made to remove his IVC filter.
.
4 HTN
- Patient's lopressor and enalapril home medications were
discontinued initially at time of admission. After his 2010-01-24 00:00:00 stay,
his beta blocker was slowly re-introduced and tolerated well. If
indicated, his hydralazine and vasotec should be re-introduced
as an outpatient..
.
5 Gout: Patient carries diagnosis of gout, but could not recall
any joint tap in the past that would have provided a crystaline
diagnosis. He had what was considered to be a flare of his gout
on 2010-01-24 00:00:00. The pain was similar to 123 Any St.us flare. With
co-ordination with the renal time, colchicine was started.
Additionally, in consultation with the renal transplant team,
the patient was started on a 123 Any St.one taper. This was started
at 40 mg 2010-01-24 00:00:00 and decreased 5 mg qday.
.
If not 123 Any St.usly completed, the patient may benefit from a
dianostic tap of a joint in the event of future gout flares to
avoid higher doses of prednisone if his joint pain is not in
fact gout. At time of discharge, he was on tylenol 1000mg TID
for left foot pain felt to be secondary to bumping his foot into
his IV pole; the pain responded well to tylenol.
.
6. Tachycardia: Patient initially had significat tachycardia to
the 140s while ambulating or exerting himself once he came out
of the intensive care unit. The trend improved with intravenous
fluid re123 Any St.n. It was felt that his tachycardia was secondary
to a volume depleted state as he had been NPO; it was also
likely that he had significantly decreased venous return with
the large right DVT. To ensure that he did not have a pulmonary
embolus that was contributing to the tachycardia, a V/Q scan was
completed which was normal.
His tachycardia resolved during his stay prior to discharge.
.
7. Glucose intolerance: Patient's blood glucose finger sticks
trended back down to the normal range after his prednisone taper
was completed. His Hb A1c was checked and found to be 6.7. He
was maintained on a diabetic diet.
.
8. FEN/Propylaxis/Access: Patient's electrolytes were monitored
carefully and treated as needed. He was kept on a proton pump
inhibitor, as well as a bowel regimen. He was ambulating
regularly without difficulty at time of discharge. He had a
mid-line placed during his stay due to access difficulties.
.
9. Discharge: Patient was ambulating without difficulty or pain
and his INR was therapeutic at time of discharge. He was
instructed to follow up with his primary care physician for both
an appointment as well as an INR check, to which he expressed
good understanding.
