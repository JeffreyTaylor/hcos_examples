Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51 year old male
patient who noticed to have chest pressure a few hours prior
to admission.  He presented to an outside hospital Emergency
Department about 3:00 in the afternoon and was found to have
elevated ST segments.  He was started on Integrilin at that
time and was transferred to UPMCE for emergency cardiac catheterization.  This revealed
left main and severe three vessel coronary artery disease
with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55
percent and was referred for emergency coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for nephrolithiasis status
post stone extraction as well as ankle surgery.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Accupril, Metoprolol 100 mg po
bid, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Vitamin E, and Aspirin daily.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies
although he does note an upset stomach with erythromycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the hospital was
unremarkable as were his laboratory values with the exception
of elevated CPKs and Troponins.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the
Operating Room due to his findings in catheterization
laboratory of a 95 percent left main coronary artery
stenosis, as well as a 90 percent to 95 percent left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion.  80 percent proximal left
circumflex and an occluded right coronary artery.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. Darryel Ortquist
Yamin where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft
times three.  The patient had an intraaortic balloon pump
placed preoperatively due to his anatomy.  Postoperatively he
was transported from the Operating Room to Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit in good condition on Propofol and Phenylephrine
drips.

On postoperative day #1, he was weaned from mechanical
ventilation, successfully extubated.  He remains on Neo-
Synephrine for the next day or so due to some hypotension,
his cardiac function remained good with a cardiac index of
greater than 3.  His intraaortic balloon pump was weaned and
subsequently discontinued on postoperative day #1.  The
patient did require some intravenous fluid boluses for
hypotension.

On postoperative day #2, the patient had some atrial
fibrillation and was placed on Amiodarone because of this.
He was also begun on Lopressor at that time and begun with
diuresis.

The following day the patient had converted back to normal
sinus rhythm.  Had remained hemodynamically stable.  Had his
Neo-Synephrine drip weaned to off and was tolerating beta
blocker and diuresis.

Postoperative day #3, he was transferred from the intensive
care unit to the telemetry floor.  His Metoprolol had been
increased.  His 123 Any St.-123 Any St. drain in his leg had been
removed and he had begun ambulation and cardiac
rehabilitation.  The patient subsequently on the telemetry
floor had another episode of atrial fibrillation that was
short lived on 2007-07-11 00:00:00, early in the morning that was
self limiting.  His Lopressor was increased and he has not
had any further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He remains
on Amiodarone and Metoprolol for this.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, 2007-07-11 00:00:00, is as follows:
The patient is afebrile.  He is in normal sinus rhythm with a
rate in the mid 70's.  His blood pressure is 120/74.  Room
air oxygen saturation is 96 percent.  Neurologically he is
grossly intact with no apparent deficits.  His pulmonary
examination - his lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Coronary examination is regular rate and
rhythm.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  His
extremities are warm without edema.  His sternal incision as
well as his right leg incisions are all clean and dry with no
erythema, no drainage.  The Steri-strips are intact.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 100 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg
po bid times seven days, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq po bid
times seven days, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 325 mg po q
d, Plavix 75 mg po q d times three months.  Lipitor 20 mg po
q d, Percocet 5/325 po q four hours prn pain.  The patient is
also to continue on Amiodarone 400 mg po tid times one week,
then decrease to 400 mg po bid times one week, then decrease
400 mg po q d times one week, and then decrease to 200 mg po
q d for the remaining week.  This is the tentative plan for
Amiodarone loading unless it is altered or until it is
discontinued by the patient's primary cardiologist, Dr.
Darryel Ortquist.  The patient is also going home with Darryel Ortquist Yamin of
Hearts cardiac monitor for his Amiodarone loading and this
will be transmitted to the electrophysiology service here at
UPMCE.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

The patient is to follow up with is  primary care physician,
Yamin. Yamin in one to two weeks.  He is to follow up with his
primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 121**] Yamin also in one to two
weeks and to follow up with Dr. Darryel Ortquist Yamin in
approximately five to six weeks.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post emergent coronary
   artery bypass graft.
2. Postoperative  atrial fibrillation.
