History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 y/o male with a h/o mental retardation, GERD c/b
severe erosive esophagitis, prostate CA s/p TURP without
additional treatment, who presented to the ED with fever to 103,
subjective dyspnea, foul smelling urine and hypotension with
SBPs in the 70s. Pt is not communicative at baseline, but did
report lower abdominal pain, denied any CP, SOB, cough. Pt
otherwise not able to give a more detailed history due to
baseline mental retardation.
.
In Daeqwon Duhart, pt was hypotensive, febrile to 103. His lab values were
notable for an elevated WBC at 18.5, elevated transaminases,
elevated lactate at 7.6, and an elevated Cr to 1.9. He was given
5L NS, and after placing a R femoral CVL, started on Levophed
for BP support. He was empirically started on broad spectrum
antibiotics of vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl, and admitted
to the ICU for further care.
.
In the ICU, patient transiently required levaphed for pressure
support. Infectious work up included blood cultures which are
NGTD, CXR which was negative, RUQ U/S which was negative, and
urine culture with was positive for e. coli, fluoroquinolone
sensitive. He was maintained on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
flagyl. On this regimen, the patient stablized, as his BP
returned and levophed was discontinued, his WBC decreased, his
fever resolved. His renal failure also resolved with fluid
rescusitation. His LFTs trended down. His lactate came down.
.
His ICU course was otherwise notable for a transient episode of
atrial fibrillation, which was broken with lopressor 5mg IV x 1,
and the patient was subsequently started on lopressor 12.5mg
UPMCE.
.
His course thus far was also notable for platelets decreased
from 130 -> 78, and therefore anti-HIT antibodies were sent
(pending) and his SC heparin was discontinued.
.
Currently, he is afebrile X 24hrs and denies any shortness of
breath, fever, chills, chest pain, or abdominal pain.

.
Imaging: EKG: NSR, 97. Nml axis, nml intervals.
Pseudonormalization of TW V4-V6, no ST changes from 123 Any St.us.
.
CXR 2013-06-07 00:00:00: AP supine portable view. Several thick skin folds limit
the
evaluation of the right hemithorax. Linear opacities at the
right lung base are unchanged, representing atelectasis or
scarring. The remainder of the right lung is grossly clear. The
left lung is clear. Heart size is top normal. There is no
pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
.
Abdominal US 2013-06-07 00:00:00: Limited study. No evidence of intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation or focal hepatic mass.
Trace amount of fluid is seen adjacent to the upper pole of the
right kidney of unclear etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 y/o male with a h/o mental retardation, GERD c/b severe
erosive esophagitis, prostate CA s/p TURP without additional
treatment, who presents with fever to 103, subjective dyspnea,
foul smelling urine and hypotension with SBPs in the 70s.

1. Septic Shock:  Pt with sepsis and hypotension, with lactate
7.8 in the ED and bandemia of 23%. Given 5L NS in the ED,
started on levophed to maintain MAP >65. Likely source is urine,
given markedly positive U/A and foul-smelling urine. No
pneumonia on CXR.  Patient was admitted to the ICU and was
empirically started on Vanco and Levaquin IV. Urine culture
positive for E. coli, sensitive to levofloxacin, and was
switched to Levo 250mg PO. After aggressive IVF resuscitation,
the patient was weaned off of levophed with SBPs in 90s-100s.
Patient remained afebrile, WBC trended downward, and was
transferred to the medicine floor.
.
While on the medicine floor, he was afebrile with SBP's in the
120's and HR in the 70's, O2 sat was 95% on 2L.
.
2. Respiratory distress:  On admission, patient in respiratory
distress, but no clear PNA seen on pulmonary exam. The Levaquin
IV for urosepsis also provided coverage for CAP. Patient was on
a face tent with 40% FiO2 but would not tolerate it very well
and would pull in off his face.  O2 sats remained >92%, even on
room air.  He was given nebs prn and switched to nasal cannula
with sats>94%.
.
3. ARF:  Pt with a normal baseline Cr of 0.7 and admitted with
Cr of 1.9, most likely due to prerenal azotemia given profound
dehydration in the setting of sepsis as above. Cr trended down
after IVF resuscitation and was back to baseline at time of
discharge.
.
4. A-fib: On morning of transfer from ICU to floor, patient went
into a-fib with rates in the 140's-170's.  He was given 5mg
lopressor and rate decreased to 80's-120's and returned to
123 Any St. sinus rhythm. He was then started on metoprolol 12.5 UPMCE
PO with no further episodes of atrial fibrillation on telemetry.

.
5. Mild transaminitis: On admission, he had a mild transaminitis
likely in setting of sepsis. Abdominal US was performed to r/o
biliary/hepatic pathology.  US Showed no evidence of intra or
extra hepatic biliary ductal dilitation. The LFTs trended
downward during the course of hospital stay.
.
6. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia: During the hospital stay,
pts platelets fell from 128 to 78 overnight. As he was receiving
SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis, there was concern for HIT. All
heparin products were stopped, heparin dependent antibodies were
sent and pending at the time of discharge, and the platelet
counts stabilized.
.
7. Mild coagulopathy: On admission, he had a mild coagulopathy
likely in setting of sepsis. A peripheral smear was negative for
any schistocytes. INR was followed and trended downward
appropriately.
.
8. GERD: no active issues during this admission and patient
remained on pantoprazole Q12h.
.
9. Conjunctivitis: He developed some white exudate and injection
in left eye concerning for conjunctivitis. Erythromycin eye
drops were started.
.
10. FEN: Patient given aggressive IVF resusciation with
electrolytes repleted as necessary.  Speech and swallow
evaluated patient and recommended pureed diet and thickened
liquid diet.  Patient was started on PO prior to transfer, and
tolerated his meals well while on the floor.
.
9. DISPO: DNR/DNI.
