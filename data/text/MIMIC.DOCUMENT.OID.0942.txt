Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old M with CLL d+8 of CEPP, s/p UPMCE regimen and s/p
recent admission for abdominal pain secondary to ileus, who is
admitted for febrile neutropenia to 101F and increased dry
cough.
.
1 Febrile Neutropenia:  Patient was febrile in AM prior to
admssion.  Moreover, patient had cough, perhaps indicative of
pulmonary process.  Differential diagnosis included bacterial,
fungal, viral infection given neutropenia.  Recurrent CLL,
atelectasis, inflammatory process, as well as drug effect, were
also possiblities.  CXR did not show any signs of an acute
process.  Blood cultures were drawn and CMV viral load was
obtainted.  A urine culture was negative.  He was started on
Cefipime, acyclovir, and vancomycin, fluconazole, and his
atovaquone was continued.  He complained of a funny feeling in
his throat on 2010-06-22 00:00:00, and was cultured.  On hospital day 2 he was
afebrile. CXR on 2010-06-22 00:00:00 showed vol overload, but no overt
infiltrate. Differential diagnosis includes bacterial, fungal,
viral infection given neutropenia, CLL, atelectasis,
inflammatory process, as well as drug effect, are also
possiblities. Cultures all remained negative. CT 2010-06-22 00:00:00 showed:
progression of multiple patchy nodular opacities associated with
peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacity predominantly
in centrilobular distribution, most prominent in right middle
lobe, involving both upper and lower lobes, worsened compared to
the prior study, most likely worsening infectious process with
persistent bilateral axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. ID concerned for fungal
process. Bronchoscopy 2010-06-22 00:00:00 showed PCP in BAL despite atovaquone
prophylaxis, therefore pt. started on bactrim 360mg IV q8, with
premedication with compazine, anzemet and olanzapine prior to
dose for h/o projectile vomitting with bactrim. Ambisome,
cefipime, atovaquone, and vanco were d/c'd 2010-06-22 00:00:00. Patient with
4-5L O2 demand 2010-06-22 00:00:00, also with shaking to 1 unit prbc's, blood
stopped, sent to lab for transfusion reaction analysis but no
evidence of reaction.
.
He was improving with decreasing O2 demand and tried oral
bactrim 2010-06-22 00:00:00 to see if he could complete his course at home
however he had uncontrolable nausea and vomitted with aspiration
and desaturation to 50% and was placed on 100% NRB and went to
98%. ABG showed 7.51/38/76 on 100% NRB. He was transferred to
the ICU for close observation and support, CXR suggested
aspiration. He was treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for 1
week out of concern for aspiration pneumonia but he improved so
rapidly that it was likely a sterile aspiration. He was not
intubated and was stable enough to return to the BMT floor on
2010-06-22 00:00:00. He was maintained on IV bactrim for 21 days, he was also
maintained on solumedrol which was slowly tapered. His oxygen
requirement decreased and he was able to be weaned off O2. He
ambulated with PT and was noted to desaturate to 86% on room air
but came back to 91% on his own while ambulating, so will be
discharged with home oxygen therapy to wear when working with
PT. He was discharged on dapsone 100mg daily for prophylaxis,
with 20mg daily prednisone to be tapered by Dr. Aminna as an
outpatient.
.
2 CLL: At the time of admission he was on CEPP regimen
treatment.  Blood counts were low.  His Cytoxan was held the day
of admission.  However, the patient was continued on
procarbazine per his outpatient medications.  We also continued
his Prednisone 100mg q Day for 2 days to complete that part of
the regimen.  His WBC continued to be below 1000.  Once his
prednisone was completed, he began a taper to prevent adrenal
insufficiency.  Moreover, his procarbazine was discontinued
after com123 Any St.n of his regimen due to drug effect.  He was
treated with G-CSF for 6 days as ANC responded well and he was
no longer neutropenic. Over 2010-06-22 00:00:00 he was noted to have
rapidly increasing bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He had a
portacath placed 2010-06-22 00:00:00 for further therapy. He will follow-up
with Dr. Aminna next week for rituxan.
.
3 Somnolence: On 2010-06-22 00:00:00, he had an episode of worsening mental
status with lethargy, as well as fevers to 102.  Demerol had
been given for 123 Any St.us shakes, his HR was in the 120s, his BP
was 160s/100's and he was diaphoretic.  The differential
included serotonin syndrome, infection, and procarbazine drug
effect.  Narcan was administered with slight effect.  He was
still lethargic, and was put on telemetry and fluids. The
episode was thought to be due to procarbazine, and it was
discontinued. He continued to have lethargy/somnolence during
his hospital course. An MRI of the head was performed on 2010-06-22 00:00:00 to
r/o CNS disease to explain somnolence, which was negative. A
repeat CT with contrast was done 7/22.06, also negative. He was
restarted on effexor out of concern for depressed mood but
tapered off again as he may need procarbazine in the future. He
was started on ritalin twice daily 2.5mg at 0700 and 1300 on
2010-06-22 00:00:00, increased to 2010-06-22 00:00:00 to 5mg twice daily. This was decreased
to once daily on 2010-06-22 00:00:00 as he felt it could be interfering with
sleep. It is recommended that he follow-up with his psychiatrist
as an outpatient.
.
4 Nausea: During this hospital course nausea was a significant
issue, primarily attributed to chemo and bactrim therapy. He had
a head MRI 2010-06-22 00:00:00 and a head CT 2010-06-22 00:00:00 to look for central pathology
contributing to nausea which were both negative. He was
evaluated by GI who felt that mechanical obstruction was not
likely to be contributing and that there was no indication for
endoscopy at this time. He also had a speech therapy evaluation
of swallowing to see if that might be contributing, which was
notable for coordinated mastication and swallowing. Nausea was
controlled with compazine, anzemet then zofran, zyprexa, ativa,
and a three day course of emend.
.
# Anemia:  A possible chemo effect vs suppression from infection
was considered.  On admission, his Hct was below 25 and he was
given 1 unit PRBCs with a good response.  His bilirubin was 3.1
on day 2, possibly due to transfusion, and repeat LFTs were
drawn. He required occaisional blood transfussions thorughout
his hospital course with a hct. averaging 27.
.
# Sleep Disordered Breathing: He has a history of sleep
disordered breathing and has been on Bipap in the past but had
not used his machine for 9 months prior to admission but his
machine was tried 2010-06-22 00:00:00 to improve sats while sleeping with
minimal improvement prior to aspiration event, but it was not
continued after this event. He is to follow-up with his
outpatient sleep medicine pulmonologist Dr. Chaynce Olfert for
assessment and treatment.
