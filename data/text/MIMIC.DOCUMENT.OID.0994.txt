IMAGING:
2010-10-04 00:00:00 CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  Migration of the
esophageal stent cephalad, posteriorly, and to the right within
the gastric pull-through, which has likely eroded through the
posterior wall and is now freely communicating with the pleural
space and lung with resultant large area of fluid and
consolidation in the right lower lobe and hydropneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Holston is a 60 yo male with history of metastatic esophageal
cancer status post esophagectomy but with recurrence as well as
brain metastasis, recurrent pneumonias and thromboemboli on
lovenox who presented with esophageal stent migration into right
lung and septic shock with afib RVR.

His initial presentation of hypotension with elevated lactate
and relative increased work of breathing was due to sepsis from
the stent migration.  His esophageal stent had likely eroded
through the cancer since it had been seen to be quite necrotic
on prior EGDs.  Unfortunately, it eroded into his right lung and
pleural space creating collapse of lung parenchyma on that side
and hypoxemic respiratory distress.  He was initially intubated
for this and a chest tube was placed on the right side to
suction.  There was significant air leak (4+) on the chest tube,
thought to be due to the open esophagus.  He required
vasopressors as well to maintain his Holston pressure and an
esmolol drip for afib with RVR.

Thoracic surgery was consulted about possible operative
management of his stent and hydropneumothorax on the right.
They did not feel that there would be any worthwhile outcome
from surgery given the scope of the procedure it would require
and the baseline metastatic cancer.

A family meeting was held with members from thoracic surgery,
ICU team, and the patient's primary oncology fellow.  The family
decided to make the patient CMO, understanding that he would
pass away from hypoxia and sepsis.  His antibiotics,
vasopressors, esmolol, and mechanical ventilation were
discontinued. Patient was transferred to the general medicine
floor, where his care was focused on comfort. The patient
expired peacefully on 2010-10-04 00:00:00 with his family at the
bedside.
