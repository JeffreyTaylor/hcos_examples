Attending:Esaw Fenchak
Chief Complaint:
acute epidural abscess, MSSA bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Total laminectomy of L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5.
2. Incision and drainage.
3. Debridement.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Naas is a 52-year-old male with medical history
significant for gout involving the left ankle for 8 years,
atrial fibrillation on warfarin, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia,
and gout, who presented in atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response on 2014-02-05 00:00:00, and was later found to have
MSSA bacteremia. During the admission, he required Medical ICU
monitoring for neurochecks and further evaluation of epidural
abscess.

Pt initially presented to his PCP with an erythematous, painful
left ankle, with concern for gout flare. When seen by his PCP,
Devohn Naas was SOB and found to be in afib with rapid ventricular
response. He was transferred to the UPMCE ED, where the
patient was evaluated by orthopedics who felt that the patient
had a painful left ankle with somewhat preserved passive range
of motion, and that his exam could be consistent with cellulitis
of the lateral aspect of the ankle. Initial labs showed INR of
7.4, Lactic acid of 1, WBC 18, BUN and creatinine of 44 and 0.8,
AST and ALT of 108 and 127, respectively, Alkaline Phos 297, and
C-reactive of 348. He was started on Ampicillin/sulbactam for
antimicrobial coverage for possible cellulitis overlying gout.
However, on the night of 2014-02-05 00:00:00, he spiked to 102.3 and 123 Any St.
cultures grew GPC's and Vancomycin was added. He had x-rays of
the left ankle that showed no acute fracture, and LENI was
negative for DVT. CTA was done at that time which showed no PE,
but showed pulmonary nodules.

Subsequently, blood cultures in 2014-02-05 00:00:00 bottles grew out MSSA
bacteria, and she was switched to oxacillin 2g IV q4hrs. TTE was
done, which was poor quality, but showed no vegetations. For his
Afib, he was treated with IV diltiazem, and subsequently
switched to IV and then po dilt.  Imaging done at that time was
concerning for an epidural collection and possibly abcess in the
L2 , L3 and L4 level. The provisional report was reported by Dr.
Naas, radiologist at UPMCE. The patient was evaluated by the
Neurosurgeon Dr. Esaw Fenchak Devohn Naas, who recommended that the
patient be transfered the patient to UPMCE as the patient
requires more MRI of the Spine (Thoracic and Cervical) and a MRI
brain to rule out any more extensive pathology.

On arrival to the MICU,  the patient was somnolent but
arousable. He has diffuse wheezing bilaterally. He endorses back
pain and neck pain. His vital signs are HR 111 BP 103/72 O2 96%
2L.

The patient was subsequently stabilized in the medical ICU and
later transferred to the hospital medicine service.

IMAGING:
UPMCE RECORDS:
X-ray spine 2014-02-05 00:00:00:
Findings:
     Lumbar vertebral heights are preserved.  Normal lumbar
vertebral alignment is maintained.  Minimal decrease in
intervertebral disc spaces noted, predominantly at the L1-L9,
2014-02-05 00:00:00 levels with anterior osteophytosis.  Posterior elements
and soft tissues appear unremarkable.
     Impression:
Lumbar spondylosis.

Ankle x-ray 2014-02-05 00:00:00:
Impression:  Overlying cast obscures bony details.  Sclerotic
line of the medial malleolus may represent a nondisplaced
fracture if there is a history of trauma.  Slight widening of
the medial tibial talar joint space.  Soft tissue swelling.
Results were discussed with Dr. Naas in the ER.

CXR 2014-02-05 00:00:00:
Impression:  Low lung volumes.  No focal airspace disease, or
pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pneumothorax.

CTA 2014-02-05 00:00:00:
Findings:  There are no filling defects within the pulmonary
arteries and their segmental branches to suggest pulmonary
embolism.  There is suboptimal evaluation of the subsegmental
branches.

There are ill-defined densities in both lung apices, which may
reflect post-inflammatory or infectious changes. There is a 4 mm
nodule in the left upper lobe (image 56 of series 3), a 6 mm
ground glass nodule in the right upper lobe (image 45 of series
3), and a 5 mm nodule in the right lower lobe (image 35 of
series 3).  There is no pleural effusion. The heart is normal in
size without a pericardial effusion. There is no axillary,
mediastinal, or perihilar lymphadenopathy. The aorta is of
normal caliber. Incidental note is made of a left vertebral
artery that arises from the aortic arch. There are no thyroid
nodules.
The visualized stomach, liver, and spleen are unremarkable.
The bony thorax is unremarkable.

Impression:
1.  No pulmonary embolism in the main and segmental pulmonary
arteries.
2.  Ill-defined densities in both lung apices, which may reflect
post-inflammatory or infectious changes.
3.  Multiple 4 to 6 mm pulmonary nodules.

LENI 2014-02-05 00:00:00: Impression:  No deep vein thrombosis.

Abdominal u/s 2014-02-05 00:00:00:
Findings:  The liver and spleen are normal in size.  Diffuse
increase echogenicity of the liver is seen concerning for
hepatic cellular steatosis.  The gallbladder appears
unremarkable. Limited evaluation of the common bile duct which
measures 6mm.
The pancreas is not visualized due to rule bowel gas and patient
habitus No mass of the pancreas is seen.  No hydronephrosis or
mass of either kidney is noted.  The right kidney measures
13.9cm and the left, 15.7 cm.  The IVC and Aorta are not
visualized
Impression:  Hepatic cellular steatosis.  Limited evaluation as
described above.

TTE 2014-02-05 00:00:00:
This was a technically difficult study secondary to poor
penetration.  Moderate left atrial enlargement.  Other chamber
sizes are within normal limits.  Left ventricular wall thickness
and systolic function overall preserved estimated at 60-65%.
There are no regional wall motion abnormalities seen.  Trace
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are noted.  There is no
evidence of a significant pericardial effusion or an
intracardiac mass.  Given the technical limitations of the
study, a vegetation cannot be excluded.

EKG:  2014-02-05 00:00:00 from UPMCE EKG read (no EKG present) Atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Possible Inferior infarct (cited on or before 2014-02-05 00:00:00)
Abnormal ECG When compared with ECG of 2014-02-05 00:00:00 07:42,
Atrial fibrillation has replaced Sinus rhythm
Vent. rate has increased BY  43 BPM
Left posterior fascicular block is no longer Present
ST now depressed in Anterior leads
Nonspecific T wave abnormality, worse in Inferior leads
T wave inversion no longer evident in Lateral leads

UPMCE IMAGES:
L ankle film (2014-02-05 00:00:00):
FINDINGS: No 123 Any St.us images. There is diffuse soft tissue
prominence about the ankle joint. There is substantial narrowing
of the tibiotalar articulation, though no definite erosions are
ap123 Any St.ted. If there is a serious clinical concern for
infection, MRI would be the next imaging procedure.

MR Devohn Naas w/ and w/out contrast (2014-02-05 00:00:00):
IMPRESSION: Extremely limited study with motion; although there
is no large epidural abscess seen or prevertebral abscess
identified or obvious evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis
seen. Subtle changes within the spinal canal could not be
excluded. If there is continued clinical concern, a repeat study
preferably with sedation can help.

MR T- and L-spine w/ and e/out contrast (2014-02-05 00:00:00):
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous pattern of enhancement identified in
the lumbar spine posteriorly, likely consistent with an early
epidural phlegmon or epidural abscess formation, extending from
L2/L3 through L4/L5 levels, causing significant narrowing of the
thecal sac posteriorly. There is also evidence of fat stranding
and edema in the paravertebral soft tissues at L3, L4 and L5
levels as described above with loss of the muscular plane and
fat on the left at L4 level. The examination is limited due to
the patient habitus and epidural lipomatosis, grossly in the
thoracic spine, there is no evidence of
spinal cord compression or intrinsic signal changes within the
thoracic spinal cord.

CXR (2014-02-05 00:00:00):
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
imaging:
Extremely low lung volumes are responsible for considerable
anatomic
distortions, including crowding of pulmonary vasculature and
widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Nevertheless,
there could be a mediastinal adenopathy though there is also
undoubtedly a contribution of fat deposition.  There is no focal
pulmonary consolidation, but there could be mild generalized
interstitial abnormality. Pleural effusions are small, if any. I
would strongly urge conventional chest radiographs and if
serious questions of
abnormality remain clarification by a chest CT scan, if that is
justified clinically. No pneumothorax.

TTE ECHO (2014-02-05 00:00:00):
IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. No definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow
identified.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high,
a TEE is suggested to assess the valves.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 52 yo man with h/o CAD, HTN, A-FIB (Coumadin)
who presented with back pain, found to have MSSA bacteremia and
epidural abscess s/p drainage, with a hospital course
complicated by Acute Renal Failure and hospital-acquired
pneumonia, which both improved prior to discharge.

# Sepsis seconary to MSSA epidural abscess: The patient
initially presented to his internist's office and was referred
to an outside hospital, prior to the diagnosis with Staph
bacteremia and was later with an epidural collection consistent
with abcess.  MRI at OSH and at UPMCE was consistent with
epidural abscess L2-L4/5. Patient underwent OR drainage of the
abcess by ortho spine.  Cultures subsequently grew MSSA,
prompting the initial use of nafcillin.  At the time of
diagnosis with hospital-acquired pneumonia, the patient was
transitioned to Vancomycin and Cefepime, but was transitioned
back to nafcillin and later cefazolin for ongoing treatment of
his epidural space infection.

The patient initially required q4h neuro checks given risk of
epidural hematoma formation, and required medical ICU coverage
earlier in his hospital course.  After transfer to the hospital
medicine service, the patient remained hemodynamically stable
without any signs of sepsis. The patient remained afebrile.
After he completed his course of IV vancomycin and cefepime the
patient was transitioned back to nafcillin. Patient subsequently
developed a drug rash lattributed most likely to the nafcillin,
at which point he was switched to cefazolin. The rash stabilized
and slowed in its progression prior to his discharge. The
patient will be discharged on a protracted course of cefazolin.
He is being followed with the infectious disease specialists and
they will monitor him for the length of his antibiotic coverage.


# MSSA septicemia: The patient initially presented with evidence
of sepsis with tachycardia, to the outside hospital, in the
setting of positive blood cultures with MSSA.  Once the blood
cultures were noted to be positive at OSH for MSSA, the patient
was started on nafcillin. He was subsequently treated with
vancomycin/cefepime before thansitioning to nafcillin again and
then to cefazolin as noted above.  TTE was without signs of
endocarditis.  Blood cultures from UPMCE did reveal MSSA, but
later in his course, serial surveillance cultures did not show
bacterial growth.  Arthrocentesis did not reveal  clear evidence
of  joint space involvement.  Per ID, the patient will require a
2014-02-05 00:00:00 week course of antibiotics. Although there is no
identifiable source for his bacteremia it is likely secondary to
skin breakdown. Patient has no history recently of IV drug
abuse.

# Left leg gout: LLE edema > R and erythema and tenderness.  No
evidence of DVT on LENIs.  No evidence of bacteria on gram stain
of joint tap, but many negative biorefringent crystals consitent
with a gout flare.  Colchicine was held given worsening renal
function. After transfer to the medicine floor the patient had
worsening left ankle pain and swelling. He also complained of
right ankle and left elbow pain. Presentation is consistent with
polyarticular gout. Patient was transitioned from 20 mg of p.o.
prednisone 60 mg of p.o. prednisone. Dermatology was consulted
and recommended this dose change. The patient will be sent out
on prednisone with a taper until his symptoms improve. A second
arthrocentesis performed the left ankle to insure that he did
not have a septic arthritis as he was at risk to do his
bacteremia and [** Location **]us arthrocentesis. The cultures remained
negative after the second arthrocentesis.

# Afib with RVR: Started on po dilt at OSH after initiation of
dilt gtt for afib w/ RVR.  Once on the medicine floor pt
triggered for A fib with RVR to the 150's.  Once in the MICU he
was initiated on a dilt gtt.  His dilt gtt was increased to 20
mcg/hr without adequate control of his heart rate.  Amiodarone
was briefly started, but was discontinued as it was felt that
concerting the pt to sinus rhythm would produce an increased
risk of thromboembolism.  Amiodarone was then stopped,
metoprolol boluses were initiated and dilt gtt was weaned.  On
transfer to the floor pt was well controlled on metoprolol 10 mg
q6h IV. The patient was transitioned to 25 mg every 6 hours. He
remained stable on the floor and had no episodes of rapid
ventricular response. The patient was continued on a heparin
drip as her main subtherapeutic from his warfarin. The patient
will be sent to his rehabilitation facility with a heparin drip
as he is transitioned to a therapeutic level on his current
warfarin dosing.

#ARF:  Pt's creatinine increased to 4.3 from a baseline of 1.0.
This was thought to be from a pre-renal etiology as the pt was
diuresed with IV lasix upon presentation to the MICU.  In
addition, he had nearly a 5-6 L NG tube output once an NGT was
placed.  A few muddy brown casts were seen on urinalysis.
Creatinine has begun to downtrend on transfer from the MICU. On
for the patient's urine output remained stable and his
creatinine returned to almost baseline and was 1.6 and his day
of discharge.

#Drug rash: Prior to his discharge patient developed a rash on
his extremities consistent with a drug rash. The development
conincided with the reinitiation of the nafcillin. The nafcillin
was discontinued and he was transitioned to cefazolin. The rash
improved prior to his discharge to rehab. While there was
concern for the potentialcross-reactivity with the cefazolin,
the type of hypersensitivity reaction, as well as the desire to
maintain a bacteriacidal Esaw Fenchak led the team to continue with
cefazolin with planned careful monitoring.  The ID team planned
close follow-up as well, in the event that a change in gents was
required, given the expected duration of antibiotics.

#Ileus:  Pt developed a post-op ileus following episdural
abscess surgery.  An NGT was placed and 5-6 L of output was
immediately seen.  Pt was kept NPO until he was able to pass
flatus and have BM.  On the day prior to transfer to the
medicine floor he had three large BM's and had a significant
decrease in his abdominal pain. On the floor the patient had no
nausea or vomiting had regular bowel movements and tolerated a
regular diet.

#Healthcare associated pneumonia: After the patient's surgical
intervention he began to have increased harsh requirements and
hypoxia as well shortness of breath and fever. The patient's
chest x-ray was consistent with pneumonia. The patient initiated
a course of IV vancomycin and cefepime for total 7 days. The
patient's oxygen requirements were weaned quickly and at the
time of his transfer to the medicine floor from the MICU the
patient no longer required supplemental oxygen.

#Anemia: Postoperatively the patient received 2 units of packed
red blood cells. After that time the patient's hematocrit is
Foley downtrend on the medical floor. He had a negative
hemolysis labwork. He had guaiac negative stools. The patient
was transfused and additional unit of packed red blood cells.
His hematocrit stabilized around 23%. There is no clear cause
for his anemia but he remained stable multiple days prior to his
discharge. We are recommending that the patient has surveillance
hematocrits drawn while at rehabilitation to monitor for need
for transfusion if his hematocrit just below 21%.

#Delirium: Patient had an episode of delirium on the medical ICU
and required intramuscular Haldol. He responded well. On the
floor the patient was noted to be somewhat confused at times.
His opiate analgesics were weaned and the patient's sensorium
cleared. The patient is alert and oriented times discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================================================

# Pulmonary nodules: monitor as outpatient, follow up --> to
ensure resolution
# Drug rash: Need to monitor for worsening or new rash. If so
