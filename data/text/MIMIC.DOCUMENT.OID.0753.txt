Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85 year old man with CAD, chronic systolic CHF EF40%, HTN, HLD,
CKD, peripheral vascular disease, presents with shortness of
breath and chest pain. Pt states that two days ago he developed
some CP pain and sob. He took ntg with resolution of CP, however
the sob got progressively worse. He felt that he had a "lack of
O2", and also that there was "fluid on his lungs". He denies
n/v/diaphoresis but did have some coughing with "pinkish
phlegm". He denies acute onset but states rather that the SOB
progressed over night, worse with exertion and laying flat. He
also notes some increased LE edema. He denies f/c/n/v. He also
notes that 2wks ago he had flu like symptoms and since then has
been feeling generally unwell.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 78 136/86 18 100% RA. Labs
significant for trop 2.13, Na 129, Cr 1.9, K 5.7, Hct 32.8, INR
1.1. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary edema. ECG showed NSR at
75bpm, borderline left axis, q waves V1-V3 and III and avF, t
wave inversion avL, no other ST/T changes. He was given 20mg IV
lasix. Most recent vitals prior to transfer:
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was seen with the nurse who
speaks Russian. The patient states that approximately 7-10 days
ago, he started developing shortness of breath and fatigue on
exertion. He states that around the same time, he developed a
cold that involved sinus congestion and a cough and a cold sore
on his lip. The patient states that his shortness of breath got
progressively worse as the days passed. He states that he has
also gained approx 9 pounds and now weighs 209 pounds, since
these symptoms began. He also states that approx 3 days ago, he
developed chest pain. He states that the pain did not radiate
anymore. He states that the pain resolved after 2-3 hours when
he took 2 sublingual nitroglycerin tabs. He denies any nausea,
vomiting, GI upset, changes in stools, or any other symptoms
with the chest pain. The patient states that he was seen as an
outpatient approx 10 days ago and had an EKG and an ECHO done.
THe patient now presented with concerns with his worsening
shortness of breath.
.
On the floor, he was initially treated with heparin drip for
NSTEMI, but then dced.  He was started on a lasix drip for CHF.
Down 1.5L at 5pm, pressures tending down from SBP 160s/90s to
100s/40s, then 70s-80s/30s-40s.  Flipped into Afib with RVR
today at 11pm.  PMH of Afib on one occasion following epistaxis
in 2012-02-04 00:00:00.  He got 2.5 Metoprolol, BP trended down, now high
60s/70s.  Got 500cc bolus, considering amiodarone, but decided
to transfer to CCU for further management.
.
Currently, he is alert and orientated x 3, denies any chest
pain, headache, dizziness, palpitations, dyspnea.  BP improved
to high 80s/60, remains tachycardic around 120s.  He was given 5
mg IV metoprolol, but remained tachycardic, and dropped BP to
70s systolic, MAP around 55.

IMAGING:
CXR 2012-02-04 00:00:00
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Low lung
volumes limit evaluation. There are bilateral pulmonary
opacities which are most confluent in the lung bases. Central
pulmonary hilar engorgement with interstitial and alveolar edema
is present. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate.
No pneumothorax. Heart size appears enlarged though poorly
assessed. Mediastinal contour is stable with atherosclerotic
calcification along the aortic knob. Bony structures are intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema/heart
failure.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions also present.
.
CXR: 2012-02-04 00:00:00
FINDINGS: As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, there is a
decrease in
extent of the bilateral pleural effusions. Sequence decrease in
severity of the basal areas of atelectasis. Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly, currently without evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
KUB 2012-02-04 00:00:00
ABDOMEN, SUPINE
The distribution of gas in the abdomen is unremarkable. No
edematous areas of bowel are seen. There is no evidence of
obstruction or infarction. Vascular calcification is noted.
.
EKG on admission 2012-02-04 00:00:00: Rate 133, atrial fibrillation with
RVR, occasional PVCs, normal/borderline left axis deviation., LV
hyprtrophy.  normal rhythm, normal/borderline left axis, Q waves
in III, V2-V4. ST segments depressed in I, AVL, V6 but unchaged
from prior EKG.
.
ECHO 2012-02-04 00:00:00: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis,
inferior akinesis/hypokinesis and apical hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
On color Doppler imaging, there is an interatrial shunt
consistent with stretched PFO or an atrial septal defect.
(Images of the interatrial septum were suboptimal in the prior
study).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2012-02-04 00:00:00,
the mid anterolateral wall now appears more hypokinetic and the
anterior apex is now hypokinetic (may have been foreshortened in
the prior study). The aortic valve gradient is similar.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
.
CARDIAC CATH: 2012-02-04 00:00:00:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

demonstrated severe three vessel disease. The LMCA had mild
disease. The LAD had a 90% occlusion before S1 with filling of a
small, diffusely diseased distal vessel via septal collaterals
that was unchanged from 2012-02-04 00:00:00. The LCx had four widely patent
stents with no significant disease in the large major marginal.
The very small marginals before the major marginal and AV Cx
were occluded which was also unchanged from 2012-02-04 00:00:00. The RCA was
known occluded and was not injected; the distal vessel fills via
septal collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
hypertension with SBP of 162 mm Hg and DBP of 76 mm Hg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with patent LCx stents,

unchanged from 2012-02-04 00:00:00.
2. NSTEMI related to collateral insufficiency during rapid
atrial
fibrillation.
.
ECHO 2012-02-04 00:00:00
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Color-flow imaging of the
interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal
defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this
study. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis,
inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis, anteroseptal
hypokinesis/akinesis and apical akinesis. No left ventricular
thrombus identified but cannot exclude. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
septal defect. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2012-02-04 00:00:00,
left ventricular systolic function is now worse. Right
ventricular systolic function is now worse. Tricuspid
regurgitation is now more prominent.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old gentleman with extensive cardiac history including
BMS, CAD, CHF (EF40%), moderate AS 1.0-1.2, 3+ MR, CKD, HTN, HL,
presents with 7-10 days of worsening SOB, edema in legs b/l,
increased weight. These symptoms began with a URI at the same
time. Had one episode of chest pain that resolved with sl nitro.
Pt found to be in Afib with RVR.
.
# Chronic congestive heart failure with acute exacerbation:
patient had increasing weight and pitting edema in lower
extremities and increased shortness of breath prior to
admission. These symptoms began with "URI symptoms" and one
episode of chest pain that was likely a cardiac event. The
patient takes 10 mg lasix daily at home. Was diuresed 2L on
admission to floor but given back almost 1L in response to
hypotension after developing afib/RVR. Lasix was held at that
time. ECHO 2012-02-04 00:00:00 revealed severe AS valve area 1.0-1.2cm2 with
3+ mitral and tricuspid regurg and EF of 20%.
.
# abdominal distension and pain with elevated lactate - unclear
etiology however on 2012-02-04 00:00:00 pt developed abdominal pain and
distension which progressively worsened, KUB without evidence of
obvious pathology. Suspicion for volvulus or some other
intra-abdominal process causing ischemia. Pt developed worsening
hypotension. Pt had been otherwise improving from a
cardiovascular standpoint. Pt declined any surgical intervention
and was made CMO. Pt 2012-02-04 00:00:00 on 2012-02-04 00:00:00.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  Pt was initially admitted to
UPMCE. On day of admission he flipped into AFib around 11pm, with
decreased BP to 70s systolic.  Was given 2.5 mg metoprolol with
no improvement in HR, worsening BP.  Patient has history of
paroxysmal A-fib. Was given 5mg metoprolol with BP drop to MAP
of 50 and minimal improvement in rate. Amiodarone was started
for rate/rhythm control. Cardioversion was attempted x3 200,
300, 300 - unsuccessful. Pt received ketamine and versed during
cardivoersion ettempt with further hypotension after shocks see
hypotension below. The afternoon after cardioversion on 2012-02-04 00:00:00
pt spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. He went back into
afib on 2012-02-04 00:00:00 until he received IV metoprolol for an episode
of ventricular tachycardia, see below, at which point he
converted back to sinus with frequent ectopy. Infectious
processes were ruled out as pt had no growth on blood and urine
cultures and without evidence of localized infiltrate on CXR.
.
#ventricular tachycardia - on 2012-02-04 00:00:00 pt was in Afib but had
roughly 3 minutes of ventricular tachycardia - this was
asymptomatic and pt remained stable with slight decrease in
blood pressure, maintained on pressors see hypotension below. Pt
had no further episodes of sustained VT.
.
# Hypotension: In the setting of 2L diuresis on admission and
recurrence of afib with RVR. Lowest MAPs were in the 50s
immediately after metoprolol, but MAP generally around 60. Held
home antihypertensives (isosorbide, metoprolol, lisinopril,
lasix). Cardioversion was attempted, unsucessful as above but
followed by further hypotension Maps in the 50s. Pt was started
on neosynephrine for MAPs consistently below 55. PICC was placed
on 2012-02-04 00:00:00.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: baseline creatinine is
1.3-1.5. He presented with creatinine of 1.9, creatinine trended
up to peak at 2.4. Likely pre-renal given severe AS and severe
MR. Pt then required pressors for 48 hours which was felt to be
responsible as well. Pt was diuresed successfully and creatinine
remained stable at roughly 2.0
.
# Elevated troponins - likely MI. patient had one episode of
chest pain that resolved with 2 SL nitroglycerin tabs. Patient
has extensive cardiac history. Was found to have elevated
cardiac enzymes in ED. Patient denies any other symptoms with
chest pain including acute SOB, sweating, nausea, vomiting.
Patient's EKG shows some changes since a year ago, but mainly q
waves. The heart axis is more leftward than a year ago. It was
suspected that pt had experienced an MI which explained the
troponin bump and symptoms.
.
# Hypertension: history of hypertension. Held home
antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension.  Is on
lisinopril, isosorbide, lasix at home.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: started atorvastatin 80 (on simva 80 at
home).
.
# oliguria - felt to be secondary to poor perfusion of kidneys
in setting of hypotension requiring pressors, see Morquecho above.
Resolved with successful diuresis in response to lasix.
.
#Hyperkalemia - K of 5.7 on presentation, felt secondary to Morquecho.
Resolved, pt asymptomatic. No ECG changes of hyperkalemia.
.
#hyponatremia: presented with Na of 129. Sodium remained in the
low 130s for several days but improved with optimization of
volume status, see CHF above.
