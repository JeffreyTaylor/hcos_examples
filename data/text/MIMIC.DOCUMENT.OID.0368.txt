History of Present Illness:
80 Russian female with h/o CAD, AF s/p PPM, HTN, CHF (EF
45-50%), CRI (Cr 1.5), lung CA s/p resection in 2012-11-09 00:00:00, chronic
pain who presents to the ED with complaints of progressive LE
pain and weakness over the past several days to weeks. She also
c/o incresing DOE at home, now limited to 2012-11-09 00:00:00 steps. She has
been sleeping in a recliner recently with her husband helping
her with most ADLs.
.
She also complained difficulty urinating recently, as well as
some constipation. The constipation is not new, and it can be 4
days between bowel movements. The urinary difficulties include
both getting to the bathroom in time (due to pain and DOE), as
well as the sensation that she does not completely void. She has
no dysuria. The swelling in her legs is associated with mild
increase in pain and redness, as well as itching. Her back pain
has been worse.
.
She was recently admitted to UPMCE cardiology service and d/c on
2012-11-09 00:00:00. She was dx with CHF and her medication regimen was
adjusted.
.
Cardiac ROS: She describes intermittent chest pain with
activity, marked DOE with minimal activity, positive orthopnea
and PND, and has a h/o claudication, though pain is different
now. She would intermittently hold her BP meds (ie metoprolol)
b/c "my blood pressure was too low" - she was getting systolic
BPs in the 70's over the past few weeks.
.
ED COURSE: In ER, she was found to be hypotensive to 70s/40s,
have a positive UA, lactate 2.1, acute renal failure. She was
started on levophed, gentle IVF given CHF, and levo/flagyl.
.
ROS: No HA, visual changes, hearing changes, trouble speaking,
swallowing, numbness/weakness elsewhere, vertigo. No head, neck
or back trauma recently. No F/C/NS, no cough, no sick contacts.
Ahkari Penn diarrhea or dysuria.

Pertinent Results:
.
ECG: Paced at 75 without obvious change from prior.
.
STUDIES:
.
*CXR 2012-11-09 00:00:00: The central venous line on the right crosses the
midline and presumably terminates within the left
brachiocephalic vein. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable. Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
underlying bowel-containing air is again seen. There is adjacent
compressive atelectasis at the left lung base. The right lung
appears grossly clear. No evidence of pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal position of the central venous line crossing the
midline and terminating presumably in the left brachiocephalic
vein.
.
*PMIBI 2012-11-09 00:00:00: Moderate, predominantly fixed basilar inferior
wall perfusion defect. In comparison to the report from the
prior study, there has been no interval change. LVEF=49%.
.
*TTE 2012-11-09 00:00:00: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function cannot be reliably assessed, but appears to be at least
mildly reduced, with inferior-posterior hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
(2012-11-09 00:00:00+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of 2012-11-09 00:00:00, no major change is evident, but the technically
suboptimal nature of the present study precludes definitive
comparison.
.
*Renal US 2012-11-09 00:00:00: No hydronephrosis, could not tolerate study
to eval renal arteries.
.
*Arterial study 2012-11-09 00:00:00: 1. Heterogeneous bilateral ICA calcific
plaque, however, no associated ICA or CCA stenosis (graded as
less than 40% ICA stenosis bilaterally). 2. Lower extremity
arterial hemodynamics unchanged compared to the 2012-11-09 00:00:00, i.e.,
minimal right-sided tibial disease, left-sided aortoiliac
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented after a progressive decline in health over the
past few months. She presented with complaints of weakness and
hypotension and most likely cause was infection (UTI/urosepsis
and cellulitis given leg findings.) Initially, CVL placed in ED
and CVP >20 in ED. Fluids and levophed used to improve BP with
minimal effect. Her infections were initially covered by vanco,
levo, flagyl to broaden GP as well as possible MRSA from recent
hospitalizations. Then, this was changed to vancomycin and
cefepime. Urine cultures grew enterococus and e.coli. However,
during the course of treatment, patient developed acute renal
failure/oliguria, worsening CHF, and persistent hypotension.
Likely multifactorial on top of chronic renal insuffiency. She
has had poor PO intake, as well as episodes of hypotension over
the past few weeks. She was given fluid boluses with minimal
effect and decreased urine output ultimately to 5cc/hr.
Furthermore, her INR rose steadily and was felt also to be
multifactorial from poor PO intake, worsening liver synthetic
capabilities.
.
Her Primary care physician, Penn. Penn, saw the patient and
her husband. Ultimately, it was decided to make her comfort
measures only as she was rapidly developing multi-organ failure
resistant to treatment. Her husband and family were at bedside
when she passed away at 3:15 AM 2012-11-09 00:00:00.
