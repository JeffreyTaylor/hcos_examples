Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2008-01-16 00:00:00 - Coronary bypass grafting x5: Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse saphenous
vein single graft from aorta to the first diagonal coronary
artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to first
obtuse marginal coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft
from aorta to the second obtuse marginal coronary artery; as
well as reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to
posterior descending coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who presented with a
markedly positive stress test. Cardiac cath showed totally
occluded right coronary artery, as well as a totally occluded
LAD with filling of the distal right circulation via
left-to-right collaterals and filling of the distal LAD from
left-to-left collaterals. There was also high-grade stenosis in
the first diagonal coronary artery, as well as the main
circumflex marginal and two large branches. The
patient was, therefore, referred for coronary bypass grafting.

Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia
Obesity
Arthritis
BPH
Glaucoma

Social History:
Retired photoshop owner. Nonsmoker. Lives with his wife. Rare
alcohol use.

Family History:
Mother and father with coronary artery disease in their 70's.

LUNGS: CTA
HEART: RRR, No M/R/G
ABD: Soft, Nondistended, nontender, normal active bowel sounds

pulses poor but palpable.
NEURO: Nonfocal, No carotid bruits

Pertinent Results:
2008-01-16 00:00:00 ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No sign
of restricted filling due to pericardial restraint.
Dr. Minjares was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and is
being paced.
1. Biventricular function is good
2. Aorta appears intact post decannulation
3. Other findings are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Minjares was admitted to the UPMCE on 2008-01-16 00:00:00 for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to five vessels. Please see operative note for details.
Interaoperatively it was noted that his pericardium was adhesed
to his heart and he was therefore placed on Motrin
post-operatively for one month for Dressler's syndrome.
Postoperatively he was was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. Within the next 4-5 hours,
Mr. Minjares Minjares neurologically intact and was extubated.
Toradol was started for postoperative pericarditis. Later on
postoperative day one, Mr. Minjares was transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. His chest tubes and pacing wires were removed.  He was
ready for discharge to home on post-operative day four.
