Abdomen/Pelvis CT
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases are
clear. There are extensive coronary artery and mitral annular
calcifications. There are multiple fluid-filled dilated loops of
small bowel measuring up to 3 cm in maximal transverse dimension
consistent with small bowel obstruction. A likely transition
point is seen in the right lower abdominal quadrant (series 2,
image 60) with proximal fecalization of small bowel contents and
collapsed loops of ileum seen distally. There is no evidence of
free intraperitoneal air or fluid. The unenhanced liver
demonstrates decreased attenuation in segment IV consistent with
focal fatty infiltration. There is no intra- or extra- hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. The pancreas, spleen, and right
adrenal gland appear normal. Again noted in the left adrenal
gland is a 2.1 x 2.4-cm myolipoma, unchanged in size and
appearance from the prior exam. The right adrenal is normal.
Within the left kidney, there are numerous well-defined
hypodense small cysts, the largest in the lower pole measuring
2.2 x 2.0 cm. The right kidney is unremarkable. The
gastrojejunostomy anastomosis is intact and appears
unremarkable. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta and its branches are
heavily calcified.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is seen in a
partially distended bladder. Calcified fibroids are identified.
There are numerous sigmoid diverticula without evidence of
surrounding inflammation. No free pelvic fluid or
inguinal/pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified.

BONE WINDOWS: No osseous findings suspicious for malignancy are
identified.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal reconstructions were essential for
delineating the anatomy and presence of small bowel obstruction
with transition point in the right lower abdominal quadrant.

IMPRESSION:

1. Small bowel obstruction with a transition point involving the
distal ileum. No evidence of perforation, obstructing mass, or
abscess.
2. Stable left adrenal myolipoma.
3. Multiple simple left renal cysts.
4. Fibroid uterus.
5. Numerous colonic diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis.
6. Stable focal fatty infiltration in segment IV of the liver.

CT Head 2014-02-06 00:00:00
---------------
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, mass, hydrocephalus,or shift of
normally midline structures. No major vascular territorial
infarct is apparent. Dorlisa Nollman-white matter differentiation is
preserved. Areas of low attenuation are seen in the
periventricular white matter, likely reflecting chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. An old lacunar infarct is seen
in the left thalamus, as well as a hypodense focus in the left
paramedian pons, corresponding to the region of diffusion
abnormality noted on the MRI from 2014-02-06 00:00:00. Paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. Dense
vascular calcifications are noted in the cavernous carotid.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  2014-02-06 00:00:00 3:43 AM
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There has been interval development of a moderate
high-density extra-axial collection layering over the right
frontal convexity consistent with subdural hematoma. There is
moderate leftward subfalcine herniation and compression of the
adjacent right lateral ventricle. No major vascular territorial
infarct is identified. There is an old lacunar infarct in the
left thalamus as well as an area of encephalomalacia in the left
paramedian pons. Dense vascular calcifications are noted in the
cavernous carotid. No fracture is identified on bone algorithm
windows. A mucous retention cyst is seen in the left maxillary
sinus.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right-sided acute subdural hematoma causing subfalcine
herniation. Findings were discussed with Dr. Dorlisa Nollman
immediately upon com123 Any St.n of the study. The need for urgent
neurosurgical consultation was discussed.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  2014-02-06 00:00:00 11:22 AM
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Comparison with 2014-02-06 00:00:00, 5:18
a.m. Again seen is an extraaxial subdural hematoma outlining the
right frontal, temporal, and parietal cerebral convexities. It
is similar in appearance and size, with some mass effect exerted
on the underlying cerebral cortex. The study is somewhat limited
by motion, however, there is no evidence of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, acute major vascular territorial infarct. The degree
of subfalcine herniation is approximately the same. The bony
structures are unchanged. Imaged sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear.

Small amount of blood is again seen in lateral ventricles. A
small focus of hemorrhage is also again noted in septum
pellucidum.

IMPRESSION: Continued appearance of right cerebral convexity
subdural hematoma. No new findings.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  2014-02-06 00:00:00 1:08 AM
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Again identified is a high attenuation extra-axial
subdural hematoma layering over the right frontotemporal and
parietal cerebral convexities. It is similar in size to the
prior study and exerts mild mass effect exerted on the adjacent
lateral ventricle. No new areas of hemorrhage are identified.
The degree of subfalcine herniation has decreased over the
interval. The bony structures are unchanged. Imaged paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right cerebral convexity
subdural hematoma with decreasing subfalcine herniation. No
evidence of new hemorrhage.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  2014-02-06 00:00:00 1:28 PM
INDICATION: 83-year-old female with recent small-bowel
obstruction and new subdural hematoma. Please evaluate status of
small-bowel obstruction.

COMPARISON: 2014-02-06 00:00:00.

TECHNIQUE: Continuous MDCT acquired axial images were obtained
from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the
administration of 110 cc Optiray intravenous contrast. Oral
contrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted images were
obtained and reviewed.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Minor atelectatic changes
are noted at the dependent portions of the lung bases. Coronary
artery and mitral annular calcification is again noted. The
liver enhances homogeneously. Again noted in segment IV of the
liver is an irregular area of slightly lower attenuation than
the surrounding parenchyma, adjacent to the falciform ligament.
This likely represents an area of focal fatty infiltration. The
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and right adrenal gland are
within normal limits. Left adrenal myelolipoma is unchanged in
size and appearance from the 123 Any St.us study. Multiple bilateral
renal cysts are again noted, not significantly changed from
123 Any St.us exam. The kidneys otherwise enhance and excrete
contrast symmetrically. The ureters are normal in appearance,
without evidence of hydronephrosis. The patient is status post
Billroth II, and the gastrojejunostomy anastomosis again appears
unremarkable. Nasogastric tube is seen located within the
stomach. There has been interval resolution of small- bowel
obstruction. No dilated loops of bowel are seen. There is no
evidence of free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Extensive
vascular calcifications are again noted within the abdominal
aorta and its branches.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum is moderately
distended. Sigmoid diverticulosis is again noted, without
evidence of diverticulitis. Uterine fibroids are present, some
of which have calcified. A Foley catheter is present within a
partially decompressed bladder. No free fluid is seen within the
pelvis, and there is no evidence of abnormal pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval resolution of small-bowel obstruction.

2. Unchanged appearance of left adrenal myelolipoma.

3. Unchanged appearance of multiple left renal cysts.

4. Unchanged appearance of fibroid uterus with calcification.

5. Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.

6. Unchanged appearance of focal fatty infiltration of segment
IV of the liver.


Brief Hospital Course:
Doser was evaluated in the emergency department at UPMCE on
2014-02-06 00:00:00.  WBC count was elevated at 15.3. Abdominal/Pelvic CT
scan showed a small bowel obstruction with a transition point
involving the distal ileum.  Neurology exam noted not focal
deficits.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial process.
Baseline chest xray was negative. She was admitted to the
hospital.  She was made NPO, IV fluids were started and an NG
tube was inserted for decompression.

At HD 1 she was found on the floor for unwitnessed fall. There
was no change in mental status and no evidence of injury.
Repeat head CT scan showed a right-sided acute subdural hematoma
causing subfalcine herniation.  She was transferred to SICU for
further monitoring. Dilantin was started.

At HD 2 the patient was stable and doing well.  NGT output was
low at 200ml over 24 hours. KUB showed no sign of obstruction.
Repeat head CT showed stable appearance of right cerebral
convexity subdural hematoma with decreasing subfalcine
herniation, with no evidence of new hemorrhage. EEG showed no
seizure activity.

At HD 3 she was afebrile.  WBC count was 12.8.  She remained NPO
with IV fluids while we awaited bowel function. Repeat
abdominal/pelvic CT showed resolution of the bowel obstruction.

At HD 4 she had return of bowel function.  Her diet was advanced
to sips.  Dilantin was continued.  Neurology/Neurosurgery
continued to follow.

At HD 5 she was discharged to UPMCE Health Care in good
condition.  At discharge her dilantin level was 11.6.  She was
to continue Dilantin for 4 weeks until follow up in Neurosurgery
clinic with Dr. Doser.  She was to restart her Plavix and ASA
tomorrow. She has an appointment with Dr. Dorlisa Nollman on 2014-02-06 00:00:00.
She has a repeat head CT scheduled on 2014-02-06 00:00:00 and an
appointment with Dr. Doser after the scan.
