History of Present Illness:
Mr. Siri is a 49M with COPD (FEV1=1.09 33% pred 2014-09-09 00:00:00) on home
O2, dCHF with MR, DM, afib, morbid obesity, and schizophrenia
who presents with SOB. He was just seen in the ER the day prior
to presentation with SOB, but left AMA. Per patient's wife, he
has had increased SOB over the last 2 weeks, being seen at
multiple ERs (UPMCE, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5912**] Siri, UPMCE) but signs out
AMA. Has been using 5L O2 up from baseline 2L NC. Patient
reports cough productive of yellow phlegm that is apparently
new. Fritz Siri wife says he has had chills and low grade temps
to 100.1F.
.
Review of OMR shows many admissions to UPMCE for SOB and he
was recently hospitalized at UPMCE from 2014-09-09 00:00:00 for SOB. During
that admission he was initially managed on the floor with
diuretics, bronchodilators, cefpodoxime/azithromycin, and
steroids for ?exacerbation of CHF and COPD but ultimately he
required ICU transfer and intubation for progressive dyspnea.
His decompensation was felt to be due to flash pulmonary edema
and hospital acquired pneumonia. He was ultimately transferred
back to his rehab facility on 2L of O2, his home dose.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T 98 P 78 BP 128/78 RR 22 O2 100% on
NRB. Initially somnolent but improved with decreased
supplemental O2. Patient was given albuterol and atrovent
nebulizers, solumedtrol 125mg, azithromycin 500mg, and started
on BiPAP. EKG showed no ischemic changes. CXR poor quality and
no obvious new infiltrate. Most recent vitals were 98 88 95/54
17 90% on BiPAP.
.
On initial evaluation in the ICU, patient is somnolent and
reliability of review of systems is questionable. Denies any
chest discomfort, leg discomfort, swelling, weight gain, PND.
Sleeps in a chair at night. Denies any SI or HI at this time.
Denies taking any opiates or other ingestions

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
2014-09-09 00:00:00 CXR:
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with mild to moderate congestion.
Limited study.
.
2014-09-09 00:00:00 ECG:
Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats. QTc interval may
be borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal but it is
difficult to measure. Modest low amplitude T wave changes.
Findings are non-specific. Since the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2014-09-09 00:00:00
atrial ectopy is present.
.
2014-09-09 00:00:00 ECG:
Multiform atrial tachycardia with baseline artifact. Left atrial

abnormality. Diffuse non-diagnostic T wave flattening. Compared
to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2014-09-09 00:00:00 multiple P wave morphologies
suggestive of multiform atrial tachycardia are now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old male with history of severe COPD on home O2, morbid
obesity, DM, A-fib, diastolic CHF, and schizophrenia presents
with SOB.

# Hypercarbic respiratory distress/COPD exacerbation - Patient
has severe COPD and history of medication non-compliance, with
frequent admissions for COPD exacerbation.  His presentation was
felt consistent with COPD flare, and he was admitted to the ICU
and treated with IV solumedrol x 1 dose, levaquin, and nebulizer
therapy, with rapid improvement in his respiratory status.  He
was treated overnight with his home regimen of BiPaP.  He was
transitioned to oral prednisone 60mg po qdaily on the morning
following his admission.
.
He was transferred to the medical floor on 2014-09-09 00:00:00, and continued
on oral steroid with 10 day taper (decrease dose by 10mg
Q2Days).  He will complete a 5 day course of levaquin.  He was
instructed to wear his BiPaP nightly as below.
.
Of note, explicit instructions were given to nursing staff to
titrate supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturations between
89%-92%.  Providing supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen
saturations greater than 92% have been associated with
somnolence in this patient.
.
Patient was counselled for smoking cessation.
.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea - pt was maintained in BiPaP nightly
with settings (IPAP 12, EPAP 5, FLOW RATE 1-10L/min as needed,
he was using 1L/min at discharge).
.
# Altered mental status - Patient's mental status quickly
improved s/p above therapy and BIPAP.  His mental status change
likely to be secondary to hypercarbia, which is chronic for this
patient.  On 2014-09-09 00:00:00 repeat ABGs revealed 7.34/85/50 and then
7.36/85/134 with mentation felt to be at baseline, suggesting
again chronic hypercarbia.  No other source of infection was
identified.  He was otherwise continued on his psychiatric
medications as below.
.
# h/o Schizophrenia/competence - Patient denies any SI on this
admission. Patient's mood depressed in setting of recurrent
hospitalizations and poor health, however subsequently improved.
 Pt was evaluated by psychiatry, who raised concerns for
competence as below.  By report the patient had been evaluated
in the past at UPMCE with concern for competence given history of
repeatedly signing out AMA.  He was evaluated by Dr. Siri
there (test@mail.com) with consesus that outpatient garudianship
should be pursued.  Attempts were made to reach his outpatient
psychiatrist (Dr. Acura Handegard Siri at UPMCE) who is on vacation until 2014-09-09 00:00:00.  Messages were left.
His home regimen of ziprasidone and trazadone was greater than
that on which he was discharged on 2014-09-09 00:00:00 from UPMCE.  He was
continued on a lower dose of risperdal 80mg UPMCE.  Trazadone was
held initially 2014-09-09 00:00:00 concern about somnolence, and restarted at
discharge at 300mg po QHS.  The patient was discussed with his
primary care physician Siri. Fritz Siri, test@mail.com, who
noted concerns with his wife becoming Fritz Siri (easily bullied
by patient), and will re-initiate guardianship proceedings as an
outpatient.  He was instructed to follow-up with his outpatient
psychiatrist (he will need to have an appointment made at
rehab).
.
# chronic diastolic CHF with MR - Patient appeared euvolemic on
admissiom.  His BNP was 734.  His home dose of lasix was
continued.  He was noted to have recurrent hypokalemia in the
setting of vigorous diuresis, for which he received potassium
supplementation (80meq daily).  He was restarted on his home
regimen of potassium re123 Any St.n as below, and his potassium
should be checked on 2014-09-09 00:00:00 and his potassium should be
repleted as needed.
.
# Lower Extremity Skin Changes - He has chronic lower extremity
venous stasis ulcers.  A small ulcer noted on L LE, with
serosanguinous drainage, without evidence of infection.  This
was treated with dry gauze dressing and lidex, changed once
daily, elevation of the lower extremities when in bed, and lasix
as above.
.
In addition, pt has a chronic wound on his left cheek from
picking at it, that oozes frequently.  Dressing changes and
wound care were provided by his nurses.
.
# hypokalemia - pt on chronic potassium re123 Any St.n as an
outpatient, which was held initially, then restarted in setting
of hypokalemia above.
.
# h/o Afib - Patient was not in A-fib on this admission.  He is
currently off his nodal agents.  He was started on lovenox while
being bridged to coumadin.  His INR remained subtherapeutic, and
his coumadin dose was therfore increased from 6mg qdaily to
7.5mg po qdaily, with a single dose of 10mg given on 2014-09-09 00:00:00.
He should continue lovenox until therapeutic INR (2014-09-09 00:00:00) is
acheived.
.
# h/o AVR - Patient was started on lovenox while being bridged
to coumadin as above. Goal INR 2014-09-09 00:00:00.
.
# Type 2 Diabetes - Patient was maintained on good glycemic
control on insulin sliding scale.
.
# Anemia, chronic disease - Pt with low MCV on admission was
concerning for possible iron-deficiency anemia.  Patient was
noted to have significant post-intubation oropharyngeal bleeding
during his 123 Any St.us admission.  An EGD performed in 2014-09-09 00:00:00 was
unremarkable.  B12, folate, retic count, and iron studies on
this admission which were all normal, and his hematocrit
remained stable at 32-34 during this admission.
.
# Relative Thrombocytopenia - Platelet counts on this admission
are similar to prior admission.  Not worked up during last
admission.  Concern for possible impaired marrow production eg
MDS.  No history of splenomegaly.  Patient to followup with his
PCP as an outpatient as needed.
.
# CODE - pt was DNR/DNI based on ICU discussion of goals of
care.
