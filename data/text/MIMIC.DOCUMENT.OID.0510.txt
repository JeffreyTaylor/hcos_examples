History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 y/o with h/o ESRD, A fib, who comes to the
Emergency Department after being found on HD with increasing
shortness of breath. Patient found to be 10L positive, but they
were unable to take enough fluid off so they took off 2L.
Patient describes that over the last few weeks, she has been
feeling a little more short of breath. She reports one "big
pillow" orthopnea and cannot lie flat due to shortness of
breath. No PND. Pt is non-ambulatory so it is difficult to tell
how far she can walk before getting SOB.
She denies any fever, cough, diarrhea, chest pain, chills,
nausea, vomit. Of note, pt was recently admitted for debridement
of her heel ulcers. Also, of note, pt recently had a PMIBI that
was negative for ischemia and showed an EF of 60%.

Pertinent Results:
2014-12-16 00:00:00
MIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left
ventricular cavity size and function. LVEF of 60%.

LEFT DECUBITUS AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS: Again seen is a
left-sided PICC line terminating in the SVC. Large left pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis is again seen. A small
right-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis is seen.
Osseous structures remain unstable. Note is made of a calcified
aorta. Heart and mediastinal contours cannot be adequately
evaluated secondary to the pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
2. Small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis

CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Probable thick secretions within the posterior nasopharynx.
Clinically correlate.

CXR 2014-12-16 00:00:00:
INDICATION: Tube placement.
There has been interval placement of a tracheostomy tube, which
terminates at approximately the level of the thoracic inlet. The
cuff appears slightly wider than the adjacent tracheal lumen
suggesting mild overdistention. There is no evidence of
pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax, and there has otherwise been
no significant interval change in appearance of the chest with
the exception of the tube placement compared to the prior study
of one day earlier.
.
ECHO 2014-12-16 00:00:00:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
2014-12-16 00:00:00 CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal
hemorrhage, or intra- abdominal abscess.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged from the prior
study. Small pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites
fluid. Findings are consistent with anasarca.
3. Heavy coronary and aortic calcifications.
4. Atrophic kidneys with bilateral cysts, consistent with
end-stage renal disease. Some low-density lesions of the kidneys
are not fully characterized.

Brief Hospital Course:
OVERVIEW:  This is a 84 y/o female with h/o ESRD on HD, PAF on
anticoagulation who came in with increasing shortness of breath
and a new pleural effusion.
.
# Shortness of Breath:  The patient developed shortness of
breath prior to transfer to the medical ICU.  On transfer, she
was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The
differential diagnosis of this SOB included cardiac causes (MI,
worseing CHF), and pulmonary (pna, pleural effusion, COPD).  EKG
showed no acute changes and enzymes ruled her out for MI.  BNP
was [**Numeric Identifier 4184**], suggesting CHF, but Echocardiogram revealed EF 50-55%
MR1+, TR 2+.  She did not appear grossly volume overloaded and
HD was continued, though it was occasionally suboptimal due to
hypotension.  Pleural effusions decreased in size with continued
HD and were too small to tap.  In the end, her resp failure was
thought to be due to multiple causes including CHF with
overload, underlying COPD, and deconditioning.  There was no
overt evidence of PNA, though she had an elevated white count
and a stable retrocardiac opacity and was treated with a course
of antibiotics.  It was thought possible that she had early
sepsis and she was treated emperically with vanco, ceftaz and
flagyl.  She had one culture showing proteus (sputum 2014-12-16 00:00:00) but
no other positive culture data.  HD was continued with good
response, but the pt was not able to wean from the ventilator.
HCP was Johnetta Gronowski and felt she would want at least medium term
trach to facilitate weaning.  Failure to wean from vent was
thought to be due to the same underlying causes that led to her
respiratory failure.
- patient is to continue on ventilatory support via trach and is
to transfered to an acute rehab for further wean.
.
# Cardiovascular:
Pump: patient with EF> 50% so CHF likely diastolic. The pt was
on pressors for a majority of her ICU stay, but these were
discontinued days prior to discharge.  Prior to her discharge
she began to become hypertensive and metoprolol was added back
into her regimen.  We control BP with home meds; 1.5L fluid
restriction, low salt diet, daily weights, strict Is/Os.
Patient during her stay continued to gradually get fluid off
through HD with improvement in her pulmonary oxygen
requirements.
- Patient however remains positive throughout her stay in the
ICU and may benefit from further volume diuresis via HD.
.
Rhythm: Pt has A-fib with adequate rate control, stable
hemodynamically;
Patient is to continue amiodarone-metoprolol.  Metoprolol can be
titrated up as possible.  Patient was 123 Any St.usly on coumadin and
was on heparin during this hospitalization.  She has been
restarted on coumadin.  She is currently being bridged to
coumadin.
-she will need daily INR until >1.9, when heparin can be d/c'd.
Thereafter, she will need qod INR until stable and weekly
monitoring thereafter.
.
CAD: neg MIBI as above, ROMI'd at this hospitalization by
enzymes, no EKG changes.  No active issues.  Cont on ASA,
metoprolol.
.
#. Anemia: Chronic issue in setting of chronic renal failure.
Basline mid to high 30s. Cont epo at dialysis.
.
#. Heel ulcers. currently with no evidence of infection; Patient
attended by wound care nurse while in house; vit C and zinc to
continue.
- will need monitoring, wound care
.
#. ESRD: patient on receiving HD Tu,Th,Sat.
- cont nephrocaps and phoslo and epo with HD as above.
- monitor electrolytes
.
# GERD - Continued on protonix 40mg QD
.
#. COPD/Asthma - continued on combivent
.
# FEN: Pt with G-tube 2014-12-16 00:00:00 poor po intake. Consult nutrition re
tube feed recs, Boost.

# Hypotension - The etiology was unclear - she had an
appropriate response to Gronowski stim test, wbc increased, and she
was thought to have early sepsis.  However, she had large fluid
shifts with HD, which caused her BP to decrease most markedly.
As her course and volume status stabilized.  Levophed was weaned
off 4days prior to discharge and her BP remained stable and she
was started on low dose metoprolol and tolerated this well..
- cont metoprolol
.
#MS changes - On transfer to the MICU, she had MS changes.  She
had a negative head CT and it was thought that she had MS
changes due to hypercarbia. The ddx also included TIA b/c the pt
briefly had L sided weakness. She was noted to have some
baseline facial asymmetry, but elevates her palate, brow, and
smile symmetrically.
The MS Johnetta Gronowski when her respiratory status improved
with intubation.
.
## FEN - Probalance at 65cc/hr continuous.
.
## CODE - DNR/DNI. Gronowski designated as HCP. ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4188**] Gronowski -
test@mail.com). The pt is also well known to Dr.
Gronowski, her PCP (who acted as interim HCP for a week early
during this hospital course.
.
## PPX - lansoprazole, pneumoboots, heparin gtt
.
## Contact - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4188**] Gronowski, Gronowski, is HCP.
.
## Dispo - To UPMCE today. Goal is weaning from vent.
