Chief Complaint:
etoh withdrawl, rhabdomyolysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 39 yo male with pmhx HIV (unknown cd4, viral
load)on HAART brought in by police after being found down behind
a dumpster. No records available in computer and ED thinks that
pt gets most of his care at UPMCE. Neurology was initially
consulted for altered mental status which they attributed to
toxic/metabolic issues, etoh intoxication, UTI but recommended
that if he continued to have altered sensorium and not clear
appropriately to consider LP for CNS infection and MRI to r/o
toxo, PML, etc. Head CT was negative. Serum etoh was 229 and he
had an anion gap of 39 on presentation to the ED. He was going
to be admitted to the floor, but the floor team asked for
additional studies to work up his anion gap and he was found to
have a lactate of 8. He was given broad spectrum abx including
vancomycin, levaquin and ceftriaxone. Toxicology was consulted
and recommended checking an osm gap which was 79 by my
calculation. Toxicology recommended giving IVF and if the
lactate  and osmolar gap improved with fluid, then it was
unlikely to be due to ethylene glycol or methanol intoxication.
After 5 liters of IV NS, lactate decreased from 8-->5. Repeat
osm pending currently.  During his ED course, patient was noted
to become tremulous and taccycardic and was thought to be
undergoing withdrawl. He was given a total of 20 mg valium and 2
mg ativan. His cks were also checked and found to be
significantly elevated > 6000 and he was given approx 5 liters
ns (one of the liters was bannana bag). He was then transferred
to the ICU for further management.
.
In the ED, his initial vs were: T 97.8 P 88 BP 148/90 RR 18 O2
sat 100% RA. He was given acyclovir, ceftriaxone, levaquin,
vancomycin. Blood and urine cx were not drawn prior to these
antibiotics. He also received valium po 20 mg and 2 mg IM ativan
as well as 5 liters IV NS and bananna bag.

On presentation to the ICU, his initial vs were: T 97.2 P 124 BP
124/66 RR 17 O2 sat 99% RA. He reported feeling dehydrated,
dizzy, mild headache, whole body feels stiff including neck,
pain in legs from sunburn. Denies cp, sob, abd pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Pt is a 39 yo man with pmhx HIV with unknown cd4 count
admitted here with etoh intoxication, now withdrawl,
rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis, elevated anion and osmolar gap. He
was initially admitted to the MICU given his altered mental
status, and was transferred to the floor after his mentation
improved.
.
# ETOH withdrawl- Patient received total of 30mg Valium and 2mg
Ativan. On CIWA protocol. Continued on multivitamin, thiamine,
and folate. Patient was seen by social work. He did not require
any further diazepam on his last 3 days in house as his CIWAs
were 2010-04-30 00:00:00. At times, it was felt that the patient was
confabulating.

# Altered mental status- On admission, the differential included
toxic/metabolic causes including acidosis, urinary tract
infection, etoh withdrawl. Head ct was negative. Neurology was
consulted in the ED and recommended LP and MRI. LP was hled as
he was agitated and he was treated empirically for meningitis
with ceftriaxone, acyclovir and vanco. His mentation improved
quickly and it was eventually felt that his AMS was primarily
from EtOH intoxication. Cxr, bld/urine cx were negative
infectious source
.
# Tacchycardia- This was likely multifactorial with multiple
possible causes such as etoh withdrawl, pain, volume de123 Any St.n
and anxiety although he has received 5 liters in ED.
-ekg -> sinus tachy
-treated ? UTI -> urine cx negative
- continued to be slighlty tachycardic to the 90s on discharge.
He reported that he was anxious about confronting his partner.
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis with osmolar gap- On admission,
his anion gap was felt likely due to etoh ketoacidosis, lactic
acidosis (? 2010-04-30 00:00:00 Calianna Dinarte) but he has osmolar gap concerning for
other toxic ingestions.
- his lactate improve, his anion and osmolal gaps returned to
123 Any St. with IVFs
.
# HIV- the patient citing confidentiality refused to allow me to
contact his ID specialist or PCP regarding his Aarnavi Hanson regimen or
other medications.
- as such he was asked to make a follow up appointment and
restart his medications.
- started on daptomycin and azithromycin for PPX
.
# UTI- Patient has positive UA.
-f/u urine culture and UA were negative
.
# Aarnavi Hanson pt found down by police which is the likely
cause of his rhabdo. Tox screen otherwise negative. No evidence
of seizure activity that was witnessed.
-his CK was in the 6000 range on admission and continued to
trend down on discharge with IVFs. His Cr was 1.4 on admission
and 0.6 on discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure- thought to be prerenal - improved with
IVFs
.
# Thrombocytopenia- likey due to combination of etoh abuse and
HAART therapy and HIV infection. In addition, he was treated
with chemotherapy
- We did not know his baseline platelet count, and he refused to
give permission to me to contact his PCP/ID specialist.
- he did not require plt transfusions and his plt was in the low
30s on discharge.
.
# Transaminitis: His ALT was 279 and his AST was 376 on
admission and trended down to 95/100, respectively, on
discharge. This was felt to be from EtOH, ? underlying liver
disease and/or medication induced. Bilirubin was not elevated;
1.8 on admission -> 1.1 on discharge. He was asked to follow
this up with his PCP.
.
# L thigh contusion: He was found to have a raised L thigh
contusion/bruise. Given its raised nature, and low hematocrit,
an ultrasound was done to rule out underlying hematoma/abscess.
He did not have fevers, warmth or erythema beyond the area of
desquamation c/w cellulitis. Given his immunocompromised state,
he was given 7 days of clindamycin to prevent infection and
asked to change dressings on this area daily. Surgery was
consulted and did not feel that this was antyhing more than a
contusion/deep bruise.
.
# Discharged : to a friend's house. He did not want to go to a
shelter in lieu of going home.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis
(muscle breakdown) and altered mental status. These problems
have resolved.
.
We also found that your liver enzymes were elevated, that your
platelets are low. These could be from your disease, your
alcohol intake or your HAART medications. Since you did not give
us permission to contact your primary care physician or your ID
physician, Aarnavi Hanson could not corroborate how changed these were from
your baseline levels. As such, I recommend that you make an
appointment in the next week with your primary care doctor to
follow up these tests.
.
You were also found to have a L thigh contusion. Please change
the dressings daily on this and use the antibiotic provided so
that the area does not become infected.
.
Please stop drinking alcohol.
.
If you develop any headaches, cp, sob, fevers, or other
concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or go
to the nearest emergency room.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your PCP Hanson test@mail.com to arrange for a follow up
appointment regarding your recent hospitalization. Since you did
not give us permission to contact your PCP, Aarnavi Hanson will have to do
this.
