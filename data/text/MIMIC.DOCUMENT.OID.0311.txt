HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
woman status post a fall with a right-sided subdural
hematoma.  The patient had an elevated INR secondary to
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.  She was taken emergently
to the OR for a craniotomy for evacuation of this right-sided
subdural hematoma.  A CT scan showed a large right-sided
subdural hematoma measuring 1.5 cm in size with midline shift
and subfalcine herniation.  Laboratories on admission
revealed a white count of 7.5, crit 31.1, platelets 375,000.
Sodium 134, potassium 6.4, chloride 100, C02 24, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 93.  INR on admission was 1.4.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient on physical examination
was intubated and sedated.  HEENT:  The patient's right pupil
was dilated and sluggishly reactive.  Respiratory rate
revealed coarse breath sounds.  Cardiovascular revealed S1
and S2, A paced.  The abdomen was soft, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  She has some left upper extremity
swelling.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She is status post a right subdural
hematoma evacuation without intraoperative complications.
She was monitored in the ICU.  On postoperative check she was
alert and attentive, opening her eyes, following commands
times four, although still intubated.  She had a
postoperative CT which was stable.  Her blood pressure was
kept less than 160 and she was weaned to extubate.  The
patient had bradycardia during surgery so EP came and
interrogated her pacemaker.  She was in the DDD mode and her
pacer was functioning appropriately.

On 2008-02-12 00:00:00, the patient had a repeat head CT which
was stable.  The patient was successfully extubated,
following commands times four.  PT and OT were ordered to
evaluate the patient and the patient remained neurologically
stable.  She was transferred to the regular floor on
2008-02-12 00:00:00.  She was in stable condition.  She was evaluated by
physical therapy and occupational therapy and found to
require a short rehabilitation stay prior to discharge home.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Famotidine 20 mg p.o. twice daily.
2. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. three times daily.
3. Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously twice daily.
4. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily.

   hours as needed for wheezing.

The patient remained neurologically stable.  She was
evaluated by PT and OT and felt to require rehabilitation.

The patient had the surgery on 2008-02-12 00:00:00.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. Button
in two weeks with a repeat head CT.

ADDENDUM:  On repeat head CT, the patient also had a left-
sided chronic subdural hematoma which did enlarge once the
right-sided subdural hematoma was evacuated and that will
require further evaluation with repeat head CT in two weeks
with Dr. Button.
