Attending:Jax Cornstubble
Chief Complaint:
exertional angina and positive ETT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization 2005-06-15 00:00:00
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting x4  2005-06-15 00:00:00 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
DIAG, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA)

History of Present Illness:
65 y/o M with PMH of HTN, CAD, hyperlipidemia and chronic
thrombocytopenia who initially presented to the CMI service 2005-06-15 00:00:00
for elective cardiac cath. The patient had complained to his PCP
of exertional substernal chest pain for the past two weeks. He
describes the pain as occurring when he does heavy lifting or
otherwise exerts himself and resolving with rest.
.
He underwent an outpatient stress-ECHO which showed apical
septal dyskinesis post-exercise, indicating ischemia. The LVEF
was reported as 70%. He presneted for elective admission and
underwent cardiac cath on 2005-06-15 00:00:00 that showed the LMCA had a distal
30% stenosis. The LAD had a calcified 50% ostial stenosis and
80% serial mid stenoses. The LCX had no angiographically
apparent disease. The OM1 had a 50% stenosis. The RCA had a 50%
proximal and a 70% distal stenosis. With these findings it was
decided to proceed with CABG. Given his severe LAD disease he
was started on heparin gtt to be continued until surgery could
be performed. Given that the patient had received loading dose
of plavix, CABG will not occur until 2005-06-15 00:00:00. He is currently chest
pain free.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
2005-06-15 00:00:00 CARDIAC CATH
COMMENTS:
1) Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal 30%
stenosis. The LAD had a calcified 50% ostial stenosis and 80%
serial mid stenoses. The LCX had no angiographically apparent
disease. The OM1 had a 50% stenosis. The RCA had a 50% proximal
and a 70% distal stenosis.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal blood pressure
(133/76).
3) Left ventriculography was not performed given recent echo
assessment
of LVEF (70%).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
.
2005-06-15 00:00:00 PRE-OP CXR
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
2005-06-15 00:00:00 ECHO
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild resting LVOT obstruction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2005-06-15 00:00:00,
there is now a mild LVOT gradient. Severity of mitral
regurgitation appears slightly less. The other findings are
similar.
.
2005-06-15 00:00:00 FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.

CABG x 4. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition. He awoke and was extubated later that same day. He
was transferred to the floor on POD #1. He was seen by general
