Chief Complaint:
left hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left total hip replacement - revision


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Stangelo was working in his
cellar on 2009-07-19 00:00:00 when he tripped and fell on a step
and sustained a left subcapital hip fracture.  As you know, this
was treated with an uncemented Osteonics Omnifit
hemiarthroplasty
on 2009-07-19 00:00:00.  This was performed through an
anterolateral approach.  His postoperative course was
uneventful.
 Over the ensuing months, he did receive treatment from an
orthopedic surgeon in 123 Any St., whereby he was given
viscosupplementation injections of the left knee.  He did not
have any improvement of his knee pain at that time.
Subsequently, in 2009-07-19 00:00:00, he was admitted with pneumonia.  At
that time, his hip was painful and an x-ray revealed subluxation
of the hemiarthroplasty.  Aspiration was positive for infection.

The aspiration white cell count on 2009-07-19 00:00:00 was 35,500
with
97% polys.  The patient was then taken to the operating room by
Dr. Yelina Ferrer who performed a resection of the
hemiarthroplasty, irrigation and debridement, and spacer with
antibiotic cement.  Tissue culture on 2009-07-19 00:00:00 revealed
coagulase negative Staphylococcus as well as propionibacterium
acnes.  The patient was then subsequently treated with
intravenous antibiotics and the spectrum was widened to include
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.  He was discharged on
an antibiotic regimen of vancomycin and ceftriaxone and
demonstrated improvement in his fevers and pain.  He completed
five weeks of intravenous vancomycin.  He developed Clostridium
difficile infection on 2009-07-19 00:00:00 which was treated with
Flagyl.
 For this reason, IV antibiotics were discontinued at five weeks
rather than six weeks.  Mr. Stangelo now presents for assessment
for reimplantation of the hip.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course:
Pt transfered to the ICU for post op care in setting of
hypotension. He was put on low dose pressors for hypotension
thought to be hypovolemic in nature Stangelo surgery and blood loss.
He was noted to have anemia and was transfered a total of 5
UPRBC over the course of 2 days. Pt quickly improved, weaned off
pressors, and BP and HCT stabalized. He was given Vancomycin 1g
UPMCE for septic arthritis. He was tranfered to the ortho service
in stable condition.

The patient was admitted to the ortho123 Any St. surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The

surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

******

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean

and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout

the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity.


Mr Stangelo is discharged to rehab in stable condition with
prescriptions for lovenox and hydromorphone.
