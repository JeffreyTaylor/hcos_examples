ADDENDUM:  This is a continuation of the 123 Any St.usly dictated
discharge summary dated 2010-03-01 00:00:00, an update of the patient's
condition.

Mr. Murrah was initially started on Imodium for high
ileostomy outputs totaling 2-3 liters per day.  This had been
coming down at the time of beginning the Imodium to about 2??????
liters per day upon starting the patient at a dose of 4 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  He received two doses and his output drastically
decreased to less than 100 cc for the day with formed stool
present.  His dose was decreased in half for one dose and
then discontinued altogether.  The patient throughout this
experienced no bloating, no abdominal pain or obstructive
symptoms, and upon discontinuation of the Imodium, his
ileostomy function picked up again with more liquid stool but
still some formed solid stools.  Again the patient was
without obstructive symptomatology.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The following doses/medications have been changed from the
prior dictation:
1. Lopressor increased to 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. No scheduled Imodium.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  If the patient's ileostomy outputs
increase again to the tune of 2010-03-01 00:00:00 liters per day, he would
require very low dose, i.e. 1 mg, Imodium to which he seems
rather sensitive.
