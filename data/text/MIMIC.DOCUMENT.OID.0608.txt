bronchus with formation of granulation tissue. She underwent
rigid bronchoscopy on the day of admission (2005-09-08 00:00:00) showing
almost 95 percent obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. She
was treated with stent removal, debridement of a large amount of

transferred to the MICU from the PACU for further monitoring and
evaluation.
