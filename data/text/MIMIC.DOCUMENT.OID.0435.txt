History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Ms. Laurich is 58 year old female with
history of COPD, Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar disease,
Borderline Personality Disorder, severe pain, depression, RA,
and oxygen use (4L without a clear-cut rationale).  She was
admitted today for chest pain and dyspnea.
.
Ms. Laurich reports that she had the flu last week and began
experiencing diffuse chest pain (10+/10), a non-productive
cough, fatigue, and pain-associated dyspnea over the weekend
that differed in quality from her normal angina.  The pain
intensitifed when she would breath deeply or cough and she had a
reported fever of 102.0, and she denied chills/sweats as well as
any radiating pain to her neck or arms.  Ms. Laurich did not take
her usual nitroglycerin, but instead called Dr. Bertrand Yazzolino
Laurich, her pulmonologist who directed her to get a CXR at
the ED.  Medical records indicate that she described her chest
pain to EMT as left-sided, stabbing, associated with pressure
and dyspnea -- similiar to her normal angina-like symptoms.  Ms.
Laurich, however, disputes this characterization (along with
receiving any pain medications en-route or in the ED.
.
Ms. Laurich also reports a worsening of her chronic diarhrea since
Laurich, 2011-03-07 00:00:00.  She also reports that some blood in her
diarrhea since that time, but denies any change in her PO
intake, reporting that she had a proper dinner last night.
.
In the ED, Ms. Laurich vitals were BP: 115/63 & 102/53, HR: 107 &
90, RR: 16 & 20, O2 Sat: 100% 5L NC & 94% on 3L NC.  She was
also afebrile.  In the ED she received ASA (325 mg),
Nitroglycerin, Kcl (40mEq), Percocet (5/325), morphine (2mg IV),
and Levofloxacin (750mg).  She denied any abdominal pain and
refused a guaiac exam.  On physical exam, no wheezing.  A CXR
identified multifocal bilateral airspace opacities and blunting
of the left costophrenic angle -- consistent with multifocal
pneumonia and a small parapneumonic effusion.  Her EKG was
reassuring, and her cardiac enzymes (CK: 21) were negative. She
also had no events on telemetry and was reportedly chest pain
free before being transfered to Bertrand Yazzolino.
.
After being transferred to Bertrand Yazzolino, she complained of chest pain
and dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pain in the balls of her feet.
She also refused rectal guiac as well as an ABG.  A second CXR
indicated that her cardiac sillihette was stable, that she had
multifocal pneumonia with multifocal hazy opacities in her RUL,
RML, and LLL as well as a blunted left costrophrenic angle.

STRESS ECHO (2011-03-07 00:00:00) Poor functional exercise capacity. No ischemic
ECG changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of possible prior
myocardial infarction without inducible ischemia at the limited
achieved workload. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures
were normal before and after exercise.

CXR (2011-03-07 00:00:00; am) FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were
obtained. The cardiac silhouette is stable in appearance. There
is prominence of the right paratracheal stripe which is new
compared to the prior study and may reflect mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. There are multifocal hazy opacities noted
within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower
lobe. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle
suggestive of a small pleural effusion. The osseous structures
are intact. IMPRESSION: Multifocal bilateral airspace opacities
and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, the appearance of
which is consistent with multifocal pneumonia and a
small parapneumonic effusion. Interval development of prominence
of the right paratracheal stripe which may reflect reactive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A follow up CXR is recommended
following treatment.

CXR (2011-03-07 00:00:00;pm) FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained
with patient in semi-upright position demonstrates again the on
next 123 Any St.us examination demonstrated multifocal parenchymal
densities in the pulmonary parenchyma preferentially in the
right upper lobe and left mid lung field and left lung base.
They persist practically unaltered. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax, and the lateral
pleural sinuses are only mildly blunted. Review of the next
preceding chest examination of 2011-03-07 00:00:00 showed
remarkable absence of any significant parenchymal densities at
that time. IMPRESSION: Bilateral multifocal extensive pulmonary
infiltrates consistent
with inflammatory processes. In light of patient's 123 Any St.us
diagnosis of COPD, consider also possibility of atypical edema
in particular as patient received large dose of fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year old female with history of COPD on 2-4L home
O2, Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar and Borderline Personality
Disorder admitted 2011-03-07 00:00:00 for chest pain and dyspnea after 5
days of viral syndrome with multi-focal pneumonia and
respiratory distress.

1) Chest Pain/Dyspnea:  Patient has history of systolic CHF and
COPD - although according to pulm notes may not be obstructive
and may not actually need O2. At home on 4L NC at all times.
Reportes that chest pain differs from her usual anginal chest
pain and hurts more with deep breaths and coughing.   In
addition, her EKG and cardiac enzyme levels suggested that a
myocardial infarction was not the source of her symptoms.
Likely her symptoms were caused by PNA (bibasilar multifocal
opacities on 2 CXRs) and exacerbated by getting fluids in the ED
(2L NS). Also, may in part, be attributed to anxiety as patient
has extensive psych history.  Levo (750mg) was provided in the
ED and scheduled for 2011-03-07 00:00:00. Upon arrival to the floor she
triggered immediately for low o2 sats on 4L NC and tachycardia.
She was put on venti mask and sats came up. It was felt she had
pulm edema given IVF in ED and CXR with possible edema. She
continued with tachycardia and it was thought this was a
combination of the CHF with BNP 8000 (highest in 2011-03-07 00:00:00 only 800s),
respiratory distress, and anxiety. She may also have taken her
home medications including adderall. Her room was searched and
these were taken from her. Got total of 30mg IV lasix over the
course of the late afternoon/evening as well as ativan and her
home dose of clonipin. HR came down to 120s. Overnight she
continued to have tachypnea with recurrently low O2 sats on 6L
NC so was placed on venti-mask. She continued to be tachycardic
all night with no improvement after ativan and confiscating her
adderall which she had been hiding in her room. An ABG revealed
hypoxia (PO2 61) without CO2 retention. She was given an extra
10mg IV lasix and put out total of 2.3L over the night.
 In the am she continued to be tachypnic, hypoxic, and
tachycardic. She was started on IV vanc for empiric coverage of
HAP given recent hospitalizations. A repeat CXR did not show
pulm edema so no further lasix was given. She was started on
BIPAP. Repeat ABG with PO2 50s. She was transferred to the MICU
for respiratory distress and possible intubation. Of note she
did say she would take intubation "as a last resort". Would not
give us the phone numbers of next of Bertrand Yazzolino sister's
number is out of service.
 She was transferred to the MICU where she was stabilized after
briefly being on BIPAP. A speech and swallow evaluation
confirmed that she was aspirating. The MICU team discussed with
her placing a PEG tube and she refused. She also pulled out an
NGT placed for feeding two times.
  She came back to the floor and was satting 94% on 2L NC which
is her baseline. We attempted to convince her to comply with a
video swallow exam to rule out silent aspiration but the patient
refused. Given that she was high aspiration risk it was felt
that she should not eat, however, the patient threatened to
leave the hospital if she was not given food. Therefore, after
explaining her risk of choking and developing further
pneumonias, a compromise was reached. The patient had a
nectar-thickened diet while in house. She was set up with an
outpatient speech and swallow evaluation (including video
swallow) which she said she would comply with as long as we did
not try to evaluate her in the hospital. She was discharged with
"Thick-aid" to add to her liquids and will see the speech and
swallow team in one week for her evaluation. Her primary care
doctor will discuss these results with her.

2) Anemia:  Patient with history of chronic inflammation (RA) as
well as gastritis likely from NSAIDs reports both bright and
dark blood in stool starting on Jaeya Laurich; attributes blood, in
part, to internal and external hemmorhoids and refused rectal
guiac on mulitple occasions.  Normal MCV, low Fe, low TIBC, low
tranferrin and high ferritin suggestive of anemia of chronic
disease which is associated with both chronic inflammatory
processes and heart failure.  Patient may be suffering from ACD
along with co-existing iron deficiency, requiring both iron
supplementation as well as addressing her underlying disorder.
Stool guaiacs were negative on the floor. Patient was consented
for blood transfusion but was not transfused given volume
overload and stable hcts while on floor.
 In the MICU she was given 1unit pRBCs for a slightly lower hct
than 123 Any St.usly. Her hct continued to be stable throughout her
stay. Her naproxen was held throughout her stay and she was
started on iron which she will take as an outpatient. Her
primary care doctor will follow her blood counts as an
outpatient.

3) Diarrhea: Patient has chronic history of diarrhea with a
question of laxative abuse and anorexia; Had some loose stools
on the floor even after medications were comfiscated and with
recent hospitalizations may have an infection. CDiff tests were
negative.

4) Pain Management/Psych issues: Unclear who is following her
for psych as an outpatient. Will likely need psych consult at
some point given medication regimen is likely not correct
regimen and she has off and on been refusing medical care.
Currently does have capacity per the medicine floor team's
assessment but may need formal capacity assessment in the
future. Also has h/o eating disorders and with laxative abuse
may need eating disorder team consult when more acute medical
issues resolved.
