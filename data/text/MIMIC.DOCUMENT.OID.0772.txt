CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic hypoxemic respiratory failure

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  79-year-old white female with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, presents from
rehabilitation facility following an episode of tachypnea,
hypoxia and obtundation requiring endotracheal intubation.
The patient is status post a recent prolonged hospitalization
from 2011-09-01 00:00:00 to 2011-09-01 00:00:00 for gallstone pancreatitis requiring
open cholecystectomy and choledochoduodenostomy on 2011-09-01 00:00:00 by
Dr. Dimmer with a long hospitalization complicated by E. coli
sepsis, a lower gastrointestinal bleed, with negative
colonoscopy, volume overload, and a postoperative abdominal
abscess, culture positive for vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus requiring CT-guided drainage.  The patient also
suffered C. difficile colitis during this admission.  Toward
the end of her hospitalization, the patient was noted to have
acute tachypnea, pH 7.27, CO2 70, which resolved with minimal
intervention the following day.  The patient was discharged
to a skilled nursing facility on 2011-09-01 00:00:00 on a plan for
linezolid for four weeks for her VRE abscess, and Flagyl for
two weeks for her C. difficile colitis.

At the skilled nursing facility, the patient has done poorly,
with continued lethargy, anorexia and depression.  She was
noted to have decreased sodium to 119 on 2011-09-01 00:00:00, which was
question of serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.  The
patient developed cough on 2011-09-01 00:00:00, for which she was started
on Robitussin, and yesterday she was noted to have hypoxia
with an oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
This morning, shortly after breakfast, the patient was noted
to become more tachypneic and somnolent, having an oxygen
saturation in the 60s on 2 liters, improving to 97% on 100%
non-rebreather.  She became increasingly somnolent, and
became completely unresponsive.  The patient was bag mask
ventilated and referred to UPMCE for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Department, she was afebrile, with heart
rate in the 80s, blood pressure 140/80, oxygen saturation 90%
on 100% non-rebreather.  She was unresponsive to voice and
pain.  The patient was subsequently intubated, with
improvement in her mental status following intubation.  A CTA
of the chest was performed, without evidence of pulmonary
embolism, with scattered ground-glass opacities, slightly
increased right greater than left. Electrocardiogram was
without significant change.  A head CT was negative for acute
bleed or cerebrovascular accident.  After receiving 4 liters
of normal saline, ceftriaxone, Flagyl and lasix, the patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

Upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient spiked a
temperature to 101, and dropped her systolic blood pressure
from 130s to the 80s.  The patient received a 1 liter fluid
bolus without significant change.  She was subsequently
started on dopamine.

chloride 94, bicarbonate 26, BUN 13, creatinine 0.3.  CPK 75,
troponin-i 0.3.  Urinalysis was unremarkable.  Chest x-ray
revealed increasing left-sided effusion, consolidation at the
left base, a large mediastinal mass without tracheal
deviation that was unchanged from that on 2011-09-01 00:00:00.  CT of the
chest was negative for pulmonary embolism, moderate bilateral
pleural effusion, slightly increased from 2011-09-01 00:00:00.  Bilateral
atelectasis, partial collapse adjacent to pleural effusions,
large superior mediastinal mass with calcific density
consistent with thyroid goiter.  Deviated trachea and
esophagus, deviated anterior and to the right.  Calcification
of the coronary arteries, ground-glass opacifications in both
lungs, with central lobular emphysematous changes mostly at
the bases.  CT of the head:  No acute bleed, chronic small
vessel ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary/thoracic:  The patient was initially admitted
with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  As stated
above, CTA showed no evidence for pulmonary embolism.  The
patient was gradually weaned from the ventilator.  The
patient's left-sided pleural effusion was tapped on 2011-09-01 00:00:00,
which revealed a 700 cc pleural effusion which was
transudative and sterile.  The patient was extubated on 2011-09-01 00:00:00.  However, on 2011-09-01 00:00:00, while receiving a bath, the
patient again developed sudden acute hypoxia, respiratory
acidosis, apnea, and generalized unresponsiveness, requiring
emergent reintubation on 2011-09-01 00:00:00.

On 2011-09-01 00:00:00, the patient underwent a percutaneous
tracheostomy, complicated by a tear of the posterior trachea.
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room, and
required open sternotomy with surgical repair of her trachea,
along with placement of bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal
tubes.  Because of the tortuosity of her large substernal
goiter, she had a partial thyroid resection.

Following this procedure, the patient was managed on AC
ventilation, with eventual removal of her chest and
mediastinal tubes.  The patient continued to wean from the
ventilator on AC and, at the time of this dictation, is
tolerating pressure support for approximately 12 hours per
day.  The patient was bronchoscoped on an almost daily
regimen by Dr. Charis Brawand of Interventional Pulmonology both
for secretion clearing and checking placement of the
endotracheal tube.  The endotracheal tube position was
changed multiple times.

At the time of this dictation, the patient is scheduled to
undergo placement of a customized tracheostomy tube obtained
by Dr. Charis Brawand on 2011-09-01 00:00:00.

2.  Cardiovascular/hemodynamics:  The patient was weaned off
pressors by 2011-09-01 00:00:00.  The patient's amiodarone was
discontinued secondary to concerns for 123 Any St.itating a
myopathy.  An echocardiogram in late 2011-09-01 00:00:00 revealed basal
septal left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction
greater than 55%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  The
patient was restarted on her outpatient doses of Captopril,
on low doses of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.  In the
second week of 2011-09-01 00:00:00, the patient's blood pressure began to
trend to the 90s, with heart rate in the 110s, along with
poor urine output.  There were no electrocardiogram changes,
and the patient did not complain of chest pain or shortness
of breath.  The patient's poor urine output is currently
being managed with aggressive fluid boluses and
resuscitation.  She remains otherwise hemodynamically stable.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was initially covered
with broad spectrum antibiotics, including ceftazidime,
Flagyl, as well as linezolid.  All blood cultures remained
negative, though her sputum did grow Klebsiella pneumoniae,
with urine showing pseudomonas.  Her antibiotic therapy was
tailored to Zosyn, for which she received a seven day course.
The patient did develop a rash on Levaquin, which she was
being treated for a urinary tract infection.  Following the
tear of her trachea, the patient was begun on a 14 day course
of empiric vancomycin for coverage of her history of
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, as per Dr.
Dimmer, the Thoracic Surgery attending.

4.  Neurological:  The etiology of the patient's recurrent
respiratory decompensations was unclear.  Jerelly Dimmer the fact that
her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not felt to be
very severe, a diagnosis of a potential respiratory muscle
myopathy was entertained.  While CKs were negative, the
patient was evaluated by Neurology.  The patient had a
negative tensilon test.  An electromyogram was also
consistent with a myopathic process with a moderate to severe
axonal polyneuropathy noted.  At the time of this dictation,
the differential diagnosis includes critical care myopathy
vs. drug-induced myopathy.  Because of concern for
drug-induced myopathy, linezolid and amiodarone were
discontinued.  All other medications were longstanding.  The
patient is currently scheduled to undergo a muscle biopsy by
Dr. Dimmer in a combined operating room procedure on 2011-09-01 00:00:00.

5.  Gastroenterology:  The patient has a history of lower
gastrointestinal bleed during her last hospitalization, with
a negative colonoscopy.  The patient has remained OB negative
during this hospitalization.  She had multiple C. difficile
screens, which have been negative.  An abdominal CT done on
2011-09-01 00:00:00 revealed no change in her abdominal fluid
collection.

6.  Hematology:  The patient developed thrombocytopenia to
the 100s during the early part of her hospitalization.  The
etiology was unclear, but was felt to either be drug-related
vs. thrombocytopenia sepsis.  It has since resolved.  The
patient required intermittent transfusions of several units
of packed red blood cells.

7.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on Synthroid.
Given her periods of hypotension, an ACTH stimulation test
was performed, which was negative.

8.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine remained well within
normal limits.  However, as stated in the cardiovascular
section, her urine output continued to be poor through the
second week of 2011-09-01 00:00:00.  She was given aggressive fluid
resuscitation with some improvement in her urine output but,
at the time of this dictation, is currently receiving
intravenous fluid boluses.  A fractional excretion of sodium
was calculated and was found to be 0.1 and negative of
pre-renal insufficiency.

9.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was
briefly on total parenteral nutrition at the time of her
tracheal seal, but is currently now tolerating tube feeds.
She will need to undergo placement of a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube either by Radiology or by Dr.
Dimmer.

An addendum will be completed for this hospitalization at the
time of discharge.
