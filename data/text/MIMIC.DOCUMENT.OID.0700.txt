Chief Complaint:
L sided weakness and IPH

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Helois Armond is a 53 yo Right-handed male patient with h/o HIV,
HCV, recent septic arthritis on Cefazoline IV and Lovenox
prophylaxis who was transferred from UPMCE due to L
hemiparesis.
   Last night, at 3AM, patient reports having L weakness when he
got up to use the bathroom( able to go to bathroom normally at
2AM). Patient states that he could not move his L arm and leg at
all and needed assistance from his father to go back to bed. He
was unable to sit or stand unsupported. He was aware of his
deficits, but did not want to go to the ED, because of a bad
experience recently at UPMCE. Later in the morning, patient was
found to have L hemi123 Any St. by visiting nurse and transferred to
UPMCE and UPMCE due to intracranial hemorrhage on
CT-scan. At OSH, patient was normotensive, afebrile. He was
given
Ativan 2 mg per unclear reason, possibly anxiety, as patient
denies any convulsions. The patient was alert and oriented
during
ambulance ride, but became more drowsy, unclear about the timing
in relation to receiving Ativan.
   Patient was evaluated by neurology team at 10AM. Appears to
be
drowsy but arousable and cooperative. Reports that he cannot
move
his L extremities at all, which is stable from onset at 3am.

ROS:

pain

bowel/bladder control, chest pain, SOB, N/V.

Past Medical History:
1. HIV on Abacavir, Truvada and Raltegravir. Diagnosed 2010-06-24 00:00:00, he
reports seeing PCP monthly and recent CD4 count 600s.
2. HCV on Ribavarin and Peginterferon
3. Recent septic arthritis s/p arthroscopy 2010-06-24 00:00:00. Currently on
Cefazolin IV 2000mg q8hr. Per patient, medication was started
since discharge from UPMCE on 2010-06-24 00:00:00 and the last dose was last
night(Need medical record from UPMCE) On Lovenox prophylaxis.

Noncontrast head CT 2010-06-24 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1.  3.7 x 2.6 right frontal and 1.8 x 1.7 cm right occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhages with surrounding edema similar to
reference study.
2.  Partial effacement of frontal Yorlet Kinsey and atrium of right
lateral ventricle with slight asymmetric enlargement of the
right temporal Yorlet Kinsey, similar to prior.

Transthoracic echo 2010-06-24 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: no vegetations seen

MRI/A head and neck 2010-06-24 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right centrum
semiovale with mass effect and midline shift.  A small
hemorrhage is seen in the right posterior temporal region.
Restricted diffusion is seen surrounding the large
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Increased signal on post-contrast
images could be suspicious for extravasation.  The differential
diagnosis includes cerebritis with secondary involvement of the
vascular structures or a mycotic aneurysm.
2.  Leptomeningeal enhancement suggests meningitis.
3.  Soft tissue abscess identified in the posterior neck, soft
tissue
structures measuring 17-mm mm indicating metastatic abscess.
4.  MRA of the neck is unremarkable.
5.  MRA of the head is limited by motion, but no major vascular
occlusion
seen.  The findings were discussed with Dr.  Armond at the time
of
interpretation of this study on 2010-06-24 00:00:00 at 11:30 a.m.

CXR 2010-06-24 00:00:00:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of 2010-06-24 00:00:00, the tip of the
endotracheal tube measures approximately 3.8 cm above the
carina.  Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach where it
crosses the lower margin of the image.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with engorgement
of indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated
pulmonary venous pressure.  The apparent widening of the
mediastinum is not as well ap123 Any St.ted on the current study.
Bibasilar atelectatic changes are again seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo RHM with HIV, HCV, recent diagnosis of septic arthritis
who presented to an outside hospital with dense L hemi123 Any St. and
dysarthria. Head CT demonstrated approx 3.2x3.4 cm R
frontoparietal IPH as well as small R occipital IPH. He was
transferred to UPMCE for further management. Repeat CT in ED
here appeared stable. He was admitted to the neuro ICU for close
monitoring and further investigation. There was concern for
septic emboli as a potential etiology of his IPH, in the setting
of septic arthritis and a systolic murmur. Echocardiogram showed
no evidence of vegetations. He was continued on cefazolin for
antibiotic coverage given his recent history of septic
arthritis. Lovenox and all antiplatelets/anticoagulants were
held. BP was monitored closely with a goal SBP of <160.

He underwent an MRI in the evening of 2010-06-24 00:00:00, which demonstrated
enlargement of R frontoparietal hemorrhage with surrounding
edema and ~10mm midline shift. On exam he was less responsive
(although had also received ativan) with minimal withdrawal to
noxious on L. He was started on mannitol and neurosurgery was
Helois Armond, who reviewed the images and recommended craniotomy.
His family initially consented to the procedure but after
further discussion regarding his likely poor prognosis with
dense L hemiparesis they declined and he was made CMO. He was
started on a morphine gtt and passed away at 2:06pm on 2010-06-24 00:00:00.
Family were at the bedside and declined autopsy.

Discharge Diagnosis:

Septic arthritis


Discharge Condition:
Expired


Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Armond was admitted to UPMCE
on 2010-06-24 00:00:00 after experiencing sudden onset left sided weakness
at home. He was found to have two areas of bleeding in the right
side of his brain. He was admitted to the neuro ICU. An MRI was
performed which showed worsening of the bleeding with
compression of his brain. The option of surgery was discussed
with his family, but given the severity of the bleeding and his
poor prognosis the decision was made to forgo surgical
intervention and pursue comfort measures only. He was started on
a morphine drip and passed away peacefully at 2:06pm on 2010-06-24 00:00:00.
Family declined autopsy.

Followup Instructions:
