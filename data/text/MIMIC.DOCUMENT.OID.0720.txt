Chief Complaint:
Rib pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Stress MIBI


History of Present Illness:
71 y/o F w/ metastatic breast ca, w/ bone involvement, on
tamoxifen, who presents with worsening right rib pain.
.
She reports that rib pain has been a chronic problem, but has
been worse over past one week. The right side is worse, but she
also reports left sided rib pain and chest wall pain. She does
not report any trauma or heavy lifting or turning that seemed to
123 Any St.itate the pains. She was recently started on percocet for
pain which did help, but she has had to take it around the clock
without full relief.
.
ROS: denies n/v/f/c. no chest pain. + shortness of breath-
secondary to not able to take in full breaths from pain in right
side; No associated rash; + constipation.
.
In ER, given oxycodone 10mg, flexerill 10mg, and 10mg oxycontin.
However continued pain, therefore admitted for pain control


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Glaucoma
3. Breast cancer
4. Rib pain
5. Atrial fibrillation
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Initially diagnosed in spring of 2010-05-29 00:00:00 with a
dimpling in her right breast and a positive mammogram.
Excisional biopsy demonstrated infiltrating and intraductal
carcinoma which was greater than 2 cm and she subsequently went
for a right modified mastectomy and axillary dissection. She had
negative margins and 1 positive lymph node. The tumor was ER
positive and she was subsequently stage 2, N1 disease.
Subseqeuently received adjuvant CMF chemotherapy, followed by 5
years tamoxifen. Had long disease free interval, with subsequent
recurrent disease w/ bony involvement in 2010-05-29 00:00:00. Started on femara
at that point with good response. On progression from this she
was placed on aromasin in 2010-05-29 00:00:00 but did not do well with this,
with increased bone pain. Most recently placed back on tamoxifen
since 2010-05-29 00:00:00.

Social History:
Lives at home in 123 Any St. w/ husband, functional of ADLs. Former
smoker for
approximately 50 pack years, quit 10 years ago.  Rare social
alcohol.

Pertinent Results:
CXR 2010-05-29 00:00:00: PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an
opacity within the left lung base with associated volume loss
consistent with atelectasis/consolidation. Small left pleural
effusion is present.  The cardiomediastinal contour is stable.
The pulmonary vessels demonstrate mild cephalization, however
there is no frank edema. Mild loss of height is seen in
mid-thoracic spine vertebral body as well as mottled appearance
and fractures involving multiple ribs.
.
TTE 2010-05-29 00:00:00: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve is not well
seen. Mild to
moderate (2010-05-29 00:00:00+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to suboptimal
image
quality, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RIB FILMS 2010-05-29 00:00:00: Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures and
osseous metastatic disease involving the ribs.  Possible acute
fracture of lateral left sixth rib.
.
CT T-SPINE 2010-05-29 00:00:00: CT scan of the thoracic spine which was
obtained on 2010-05-29 00:00:00, and employed contrast administration
intravenously.  The study was reported by myself and Dr.
Vesper as revealing "diffusely abnormal appearing vertebral
bodies in the thoracic spine as seen on the prior MRI scan
consistent with metastatic disease.  A focal lytic lesion in T5
vertebral body has progressed since 2010-05-29 00:00:00.  Anterior wedging of
T12 with an associated central lucency extending to the superior
endplate suggests pathological fracture. Heterogeneously
enlarged thyroid gland.  Correlate sonDrena Vesper."  Comparison
with the prior study of 2010-05-29 00:00:00 reveals likely progression
of diffuse metastatic disease of the thoracic spine.  While the
present study appears to be of higher spatial resolution than
the prior examination, there has been some progression of
compression fractures, including nearly all thoracic vertebral
bodies, most notably at T7, T8 and T12.  However, there does not
appear to be retropulsion of pathologic fractures into the
central spinal canal.  The T5 lytic lesion is not as clearly
discernible at this time, suggesting there may have been some
interval reactive sclerosis.  There are probable small bilateral
pleural effusions, slightly more evident on the left side, as
well as multiple small wedge-shaped areas of soft tissue density
within the posterior lung fields.  These pulmonary lesions were
not present on the prior spinal CT scan but were seen, at least
in part, on a recent torso CT scan.  It is suggested that these
pulmonary issues be reviewed
with the chest CT service, and if deemed necessary, a followup
chest CT scan be obtained. Finally, there is no overt sign or an
epidural mass on this study, although in this regard, MR
scanning is more efficacious at detecting such an abnormality.
CONCLUSION:  Apparent progression of what is likely diffuse
osseous metastatic disease, with the appearance of multiple
compression fractures as noted above.

2010-05-29 00:00:00 TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-05-29 00:00:00,
the mitral
deceleration time is now shorter suggestive of more severe
diastolic
dysfunction/elevated left atrial pressures. Significant
tricuspid
regurgitation is now detected (suboptimal visualized in prior
study).
Significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in now
detected (unable to
assess in prior study).


Brief Hospital Course:
71 y/o F w/ metastatic breast ca, w/ bone involvement, on
tamoxifen, who was admitted with worsening chest wall pain.
.
The patient was intially admitted to the oncology service for
pain control.  She was intially managed on the floor with oral
narcotic pain regimens. Rib films revealed multiple chronic and
acute rib fractures.  Given persistently poorly controlled pain
despite uptitration of narcotics, CT of her T-spine was
obtained; this study revealed multiple vertebral compression
fractures.  Patient was fitted with an abdominal binder for
support with ambulation.  On 2010-05-29 00:00:00 the patient developed an
episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular resonse,
and developed pulmonary edema requiring intubation and
transferred to the UPMCE.
.
1. Respiratory failure: Due to pulmonary edema secondary to
hypertension and atrial fibrillation with underlying diastolic
heart failure.  She was diuresed on a lasix gtt with
improvement.  She was extubated on 2010-05-29 00:00:00.  She did well, and
was transferred to OMED on 2010-05-29 00:00:00, however, became quite anxious,
hypertensive and developed recurrent pulmonary edema requiring
transfer back to the ICU on 2010-05-29 00:00:00; her respiratory status quickly
normalized with diuresis as well as control of her anxiety and
blood pressure. She continued to improve o nthe floor, with IV
lasix 20mg UPMCE
.
2 Hypertension, Diastolic heart failure:  Patient was on regimen
of Diovan and Toprol at time of admission.  These were
discontinued on the floor as her narcotics were uptitrated.
After extubation, she developed another episode of hypertension
in the setting of anxiety and was noted to have persistantly
elevated SBP, therefore her Diovan was restarted on 2010-05-29 00:00:00.  She
was transferred to cardiology for optimization of her cardiac
regimen. Beta blocker was discontinued and her diovan was
uptitrated.
.
3 PAF: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  Her INR was supratherapeutic at 3.5 at time of
admission on home dose of 4.5 mg qHS.  On 2010-05-29 00:00:00 the patient
developed Afib with RVR, developed pulmonary edema requiring
intubation.  While in the ICU, her coumadin was discontinued due
to anticipated procedures.  Several regimens for rate control
were trialed including diltiazem gtt, digoxin; the patient
flipped in and out of NSR and afib for several days, frequently
dropping her BP and requiring Neo while in Afib.  EP was
consulted. She was loaded on Amio; she converted to NSR and
remained there for the remainder of her hospitalization with
intermittant brief periods of asymptomatic PAF, .
Coumadin was restarted on 2010-05-29 00:00:00 and she reached therapeutic
levels prior to d/c.
.
4 Pain control: The pain team was consulted.  The patient was
controlled with dexamethasone, tylenol, lyrica, tizanidine,
lidocaine patch, and PRN dilaudid.
.
5 Anxiety: The patient has significant anxiety which exacerbate
her HTN and atrial fibrillation.  She was given ativan PRN with
good relief.
.
6 Metastatic breast cancer: The patient was continued on
tamoxifen.  She will follow up with her primary oncologist for
further management.
.
7 Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea on 2010-05-29 00:00:00.  She was
started empirically on PO Flagyl with improvement of her
symptoms.  C Diff was negative x2.  She will complete a 7 day
course of flagyl.

On the day of discharge, patient is feeling improved.  She has
had good success with physical therapy, and her breathing feels
improved.  Her blood pressure is well controlled and she is in
NSR.
