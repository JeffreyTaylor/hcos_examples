History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old gentleman with a history of metastatic
esophageal adenocarcinoma (HER-2 positive), s/p esophagectomy,
s/p 2 cycles of cisplastin and 5-FU with last chemo on
2006-06-23 00:00:00, currently with a J-tube, who presents with cough and
fever.

In brief, with regards to his metastatic esophageal cancer he
underwent esophagectomy in 9/2006-06-23 00:00:00.  He subsequently was noted to
have metastatic disease to the brain for which he underwent a
craniotomy. He has had several anastomotic dilations for
stricture/dysphasia which have been complicated by aspiration
pneumonia. His last dilation was 2006-06-23 00:00:00. This admission was
also complicated by a pnemonia with radiographic evidence of a
RLL opacity. He also underwent laparoscopic jejunostomy feeding
tube placement as well as biopsy of an esophago-gastric conduit
and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.  Unfortunately the
esophago-gastric anastomosis biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
Since this discharge, he has had recurrent episodes of coughing
and increased sputum production. His tube feeds have been
decreased in an attempt to improve his symptoms w/ notable
decrease in the amount of regurgitated fluid.

For the past week, he has noted increase in cough and sputum
production. He has been increasingly tired. Today, a family
member took his vitals and noted HR 125 and RR 28 prompting
referral to the ED by his oncology fellow. He also felt
subjectively febrile. He reports always coughing and choking w/
eating. He denied abdominal pain, chills, diarrhea or
constipation, chest pain or palpitations or any other symptoms
that were concerning to him.

In the ED, initial VS were:  101.0 131 101/61 2 90% 3L.  A chest
xray revealed a RLL opacity concerning for pna. He was given
cefepime and tylenol. A request for ICU admission was made in
setting of tachycardia and hypotension. He arrived in the MICU
where he was stabilized on BiPap and then transferred to the
floor.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chills, recent weight gain. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure,
palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies
dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies rashes or skin changes.

PERTINENT IMAGING

1. CXR (2006-06-23 00:00:00)
IMPRESSION:  There is continued opacification of the right lung
base, possibly reflecting a combination of pleural effusion with
atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.  Small right
pleural effusion is unchanged.

2. VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW (2006-06-23 00:00:00)
Single aspiration event with thin barium.  For details, please
see report by the speech and swallow division on OMR.

3. Upper GI Series (2006-06-23 00:00:00)
No evidence of fistula formation.

4.  CT Abdomen and Pelvis (2006-06-23 00:00:00)
  No bowel obstruction. No reflux of contrast administered via
the J-tube
into the duodenum or proximal jejunum.  No CT explanation for
patient's
presentation.
  Bilateral pleural effusions, increased on the right since
2006-06-23 00:00:00.  The
small left effusion is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 year old gentleman with a history of metastatic
esophageal adenocarcinoma (HER-2 positive), s/p esophagectomy,
s/p 2 cycles of cisplastin and 5-FU with last chemo on
2006-06-23 00:00:00, currently with a J-tube, who presents with cough and
fever.
.
Aspiration pneumonia: The initial differential of his cough
included aspiration pna vs pneumonitis vs fistula vs post
obstructive pna.  Pt reported chronic coughing/choking w/ eating
suggesting aspiration. A possible fistula was suggested during
recent endoscopy (2006-06-23 00:00:00) which was covered by metal stent.
Given ulcerated and friable esophagus noted, new or recurrent
fistula possible. Patient was initially started on Ceftriaxone
and Metronidazole (day 1 = 2006-06-23 00:00:00) IV to cover for aspiration
pneumonia.  CXR showed RLL opacity but there was a question of
chronicity as this has been seen on prior imaging.  GI was
consulted in regards to a possible T-E fistula.  He had a
swallow study as well as upper GI series and CT abdomen, none of
which saw evidence of a fistula.  There was some concern for
reflux of his tube feeds exacerbating his risk for aspiration,
however the CT abdomen showed no evidence of reflux of tube
feeds into the esophagus.  The swallow study showed one
aspiration event with thin liquids and new PO recommendations
were made.  Nutrition was also consulted and made
recommendations re: tube feeds.  See below for changes made to
diet and tube feeds.  The patient was clinically well after
being placed on I.V. antibiotics.  The GI service as well as
thoracic surgery saw him and did not feel he would benefit from
further aggressive intervention.  Given his past history of TB,
he was ruled out via induced sputums.  One of these sputums grew
gram negative rods, so he was switched to Zosyn.  The organism
was identified as Achromobacter.  He was on IV antibiotics for 7
days and transitioned to Levofloxacin based on sensitivities.
He will complete 7 days of Levofloxacin for a total of a 14 day
course.
.
Metastatic Esophageal Adenocarcinoma (HER-2 positive):
Metastatic to brain with extention to gastric-esophageal
anastamosis. S/p chemoradiation, partial esophagectomy,
craniomety and multiple anastomotic dilations for
stricture/dysphasia symptoms.  Due to have CT torso in 2006-06-23 00:00:00 with
anticipated discussion for further surgical intervention versus
restarting chemo.  Plan as per Dr. Jailen Renoll.  Patient will have
appointment scheduled for within 1-2 weeks.
.
Atrial fibrillation: Sinus Rhythm. Patient was on amiodarone 200
UPMCE as an outpatient as well as metoprolol 25 UPMCE.  During this
hospitalization, he had brief episodes of afib with RVR to the
120s/130s.  We uptitrated his metoprolol to 50 UPMCE and these
episodes resolved.  He will f/u with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1046**] Holston of UPMCE
for further management.
.
Recurrent DVT/PE: H/o RLL PE, right axillary DVT and LUL PE.  He
was continued on lovenox.
.
Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine daily.
.
Anxiety:  Continued ativan 0.5 mg qHS for insomnia.
.
Rheumatoid Arthritis: Continued prednisone, oxycodone and
sennosides.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Patient has follow-ups with UPMCE PCP as well as his Oncologist,
Dr. Jailen Renoll.  His risk for readmission is significant given
his morbidities relating to esophageal cancer treatment.
Patient was satisfied with the new swallow recommendations as
well as new tube feed formula.  He is a poor candidate for more
invasive surgical interventions at this time and this was
explained to him by GI as well as Thoracic surgery.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Holston,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at UPMCE.  You presented to
the hospital because of cough and difficulty breathing secondary
to pneumonia.  You were admitted and placed on broad spectrum
antibiotics. You will need to continue antibiotics when you
leave. We did imaging to rule out concerning pathology in your
esophagus as well as at the site of your J-tube. You were
evaluated by Nutrition Services as well as Speech Therapy who
recommended some changes to your tube feeds as well as
swallowing technique.

Please make the following changes to your medications:
- Please STOP Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg twice a day
- Please START Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg, take twice a day,
until your next primary care physician Jailen Renoll.
- Please START Levofloxacin 750mg by mouth once daily for 7 more
days starting today, 2006-06-23 00:00:00, last day is 2006-06-23 00:00:00

Please continue with your other home medications as prescribed.
