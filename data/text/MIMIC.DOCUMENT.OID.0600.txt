CT reviewed at that visit. Per Dr.Altheda Mccorkle note: Prior
surgery with a plate lying anterior at the C4 through C6 levels.
The screws at C5 are slightly inferior placed. There is probably
nonunion at C4-C5. There are two completely extruded screws
inferior to that plate probably coming from the C4 and C5 areas.
They are in close contact with the esophagus and potentially
causing the symptoms of dysphagia.
The risks and benefits of undergoing surgical intervention were
discussed with the patient. He now electively presents for ACDF
revision.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt electively presented and underwent a revision of his 123 Any St.us
ACDF. Surgery was without complication and he tolerated it well.
Please see operative report for details, but of note there was a
hypopharyngeal fenestration discovered during surgery likely
caused by free floating hardware. Given the injury to his
pharynx he remained intubated for 48 hours.

on 2012-09-16 00:00:00 the patient was safely extubated after being seen by
ENT. During extubation his dobhoff was accidentally removed. ENT
made two separate attempts to replace it fiberoptically was they
were not successful. He had a temperature to 101 overnight.
Chest xray showed no signs of pneumonia. He was started on
Unasyn to continue until JP drain was removed.

On 2012-09-16 00:00:00 the patient was stable and was transfered out of the
ICU. On 2012-09-16 00:00:00, patient reported some discomfort overnight and
anxiety. He was started on xanax. ENT to evaluate and remove JP
drain.

On 2012-09-16 00:00:00 patient was complaining of right lower extremity pain
and swelling, on exam we noted 1+ pitting edema and ordered a
doppler ultrasound which showed a leaking UPMCE cyst and no DVT.


On 2012-09-16 00:00:00, patient underwent video swallow which showed no
definitive leak. Full liquids were started and patient had no
evidence of leak overnight.

On 2012-09-16 00:00:00, drain was removed, patient continued to have a nonfocal
intact neurologic exam and was discharged home with instructions
