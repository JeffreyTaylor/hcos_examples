Service:  GREEN GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old elderly lady
underwent an open cholecystectomy and common bile duct
exploration for type I Mirizzi syndrome three weeks prior to
admission.  On 2010-07-11 00:00:00, one day prior to admission,
she had a normal T-tube cholangiogram without antibiotic
coverage.  She was seen by Dr. Obst in his office and
approximately two hours later removed the T-tube without
incident.  After the removal of the tube, the patient
developed progressive nausea and chills and right sided
abdominal pain as reported by her daughter.  She presented to
the UPMCE Emergency Department
hypotensive to 80s systolic and acidotic leading to
intubation and institution of pressor support.  Her white
count at the time of admission was 12 with a total bilirubin
of 3.6.  AST and ALT were both above 500 with an alkaline
phosphatase of 334.  Her amylase and lipase were both in the
normal range.

On examination at the time of admission, Mrs. Holliann
Holliann Obst abdomen was soft with mild right upper quadrant
guarding.  CT examination showed no collection and a mildly
dilated common bile duct.  Ascending cholangitis secondary to
seeding at the time of cholangiogram with stricture at the
T-tube site with or without a retained stone was the
diagnosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Breast cancer
3.  High cholesterol
4.  Diabetes mellitus
5.  Hypothyroidism
6.  Multinodular goiter

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Breast lumpectomy in 2010-07-11 00:00:00 and a
thyroidectomy in 2010-07-11 00:00:00.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol
2.  Glyburide
3.  Synthroid
4.  Lipitor
5.  ASA

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On 2010-07-11 00:00:00, Mrs. Obst was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close
management of her respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious
status.  She was seen by the ERCP service/fellow and she
received an emergency MRCP for ascending cholangitis.  This
study showed altered papilla anatomy, dilated common bile
duct and question of common hepatic duct stricture.  There
was no small leak at the site of the cystic duct/T-tube
track.  The ERCP resulted in 10 cc of purulent aspirate and a
10 French x 8 cm stent was placed.  After this procedure,
Mrs. Obst continued to be monitored closely in the
Intensive Care Unit where her cardiovascular status was
monitored using a Swan-Ganz catheter.

By hospital day #3, Mrs. Obst was showing clinical
improvement from her ascending cholangitis.  On this day, she
started to wean off the ventilator and her white count
declined to 5.7.  The rest of Mrs.Obst Surgical
Intensive Care Unit course was characterized by progressive
weaning from the ventilators and from dobutamine and other
medications used to support her cardiovascular status.
Intravenous antibiotics consisting of Flagyl, ceftriaxone and
ampicillin were continued.  The patient was extubated on 2010-07-11 00:00:00 and on 2010-07-11 00:00:00 she was transferred to the
patient floor out of the Intensive Care Unit and placed on
Levaquin.  Her status continued to stabilize and improve on
the floor and her condition at the time of discharge was very
good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Very good

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Ascending cholangitis

Per consultation with the physical therapy service, discharge
of the patient to a rehabilitation center was suggested, as
the patient lived alone and would not be able to, at the time
of discharge, successfully complete all of her necessary
activities of daily life.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Dr. Obst and this should be done in two
weeks after discharge.
