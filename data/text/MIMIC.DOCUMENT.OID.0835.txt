THIS IS A DICTATION FROM THE HOSPITAL COURSE FROM 2005-01-17 00:00:00 THROUGH 2005-01-17 00:00:00.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Patient is a 39-year-old male
with a history of HIV, not on HAART, no history of
opportunistic infection, who presented with weeks of
worsening dyspnea.  The patient refused to see his primary
doctor, but the patient's ex-noted that he was becoming
increasingly dyspneic over the month prior to admission.  His
mother, who had not seen the patient for about a month, noted
that he was increasingly short of breath on the phone.  On
the day of admission, the patient complained of dizziness,
dyspnea with minimal exertion.  The patient's ex-roommate
called EMS, who brought the patient to the Emergency Room.
Of note, the patient was seen at UPMCE
Emergency Room several weeks prior to this presentation with
shortness of breath and malaise.  He was sent home without
any therapy.

In the Emergency Department, the patient became increasingly
hypoxic on 100% nonrebreather, with peripheral oxygen
saturation to be 86%.  The patient was intubated, and placed
on a sepsis protocol.  He was aggressively volume
resuscitated and an arterial line was placed after
intubation.  The patient became hypotensive with systolic
blood pressure in the 70s, and was started on a Levophed
drip.  The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics
and was transferred to the UPMCE Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV.  Unknown CD4 and viral load on admission.  The
patient was diagnosed about one and a half years ago.  He has
never been on HAART therapy secondary to concern about side
effects.  He denies any history of opportunistic infection.
2.  Congenially absent pyoid.
3.  Depression.

ALLERGIES:  Soap causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Levoxyl 150 mcg po q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unable to be obtained.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives alone, used to have a
roommate. Patient admits to a 25 pack year tobacco history,
and quit two weeks prior to admission, secondary to shortness
of breath.  Patient admits to a history of alcohol use and
quit two weeks ago as well.  The patient is sexually active
only with men.

ST changes.  Chest x-ray:  Diffuse bilateral hazy
opacification, right greater than left.  Differential
diagnosis included atypical infection versus noncardiac
pulmonary edema, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Our impression was that
this was a 39-year-old gentlemen with HIV, presenting with
fevers, shortness of breath, for one month, now with diffuse
pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure.  The patient was also hypotensive
requiring pressors.  The patient was thought to have a
pneumonia with septic physiology.

1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  The patient was intubated
on admission, and was managed with adult respiratory distress
syndrome type strategy with low lung volumes, increasing PEEP
to decrease FIO2 as tolerated.  While intubated, the patient
needed heavy sedation to stop him from pulling large tidal
volumes and causing >......<trauma.  On 2005-01-17 00:00:00, the
patient underwent a bronchoscopy with BAL, which was positive
for PCP by immunofluorescent staining.  The patient was
started on Bactrim and steroids to complete a 21 day course.
The patient initially had an improving respiratory distress
after being on the ventilator for five days.  He was
eventually weaned off sedation, and extubated on 2005-01-17 00:00:00,
after five days of mechanical ventilation.  The patient was
initially on a 100% nonrebreather after being extubated,
which was weaned to 3 liters nasal cannula.  However, the
patient subsequently developed increasing oxygen requirement,
and was found to have marginal oxygen saturations in the high
80s on 100% nonrebreather.  A repeat chest x-ray done on
2005-01-17 00:00:00 revealed persistent diffuse air space disease,
possibly worsened from before.  On 2005-01-17 00:00:00, the patient
was re-intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  On
re-intubation, the patient required two recruitment maneuvers
with PEEP of 35 with improvement of his oxygenation.  The
patient once again appeared to have an adult respiratory
distress syndrome type picture, possibly worsened compared to
his prior intubation.

An esophageal balloon was transfused on 2005-01-17 00:00:00, revealing
that his optimal PEEP to obtain a transpulmonary expiratory
pressure of 0 was a PEEP of 12.  The patient's FIO2 was
gradually weaned to 50%.  The patient was aggressively
suctioned for copious amounts of >.......<sputum via his
endotracheal tube.  On 2005-01-17 00:00:00, the patient was weaned to
pressure support ventilation and on 2005-01-17 00:00:00, the patient
did well on this spontaneous breathing trial and was once
again extubated.

From 2005-01-17 00:00:00 to 2005-01-17 00:00:00, the patient had
progressively decreasing oxygen requirement, and prior to
leaving the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was on a 50%
face tent with adequate oxygenation.

2.  Sepsis:  The patient was hypotensive on admission,
requiring pressors for support.  The patient was aggressively
resuscitated with intravenous fluids in the Emergency Room,
receiving about 7-8 liters of intravenous normal saline.  The
patient's hemodynamics as per the sepsis protocol improved,
and was off pressors by 2005-01-17 00:00:00.  After it was determined
that the source for the sepsis was likely PCP pneumonia, as
all other culture date remained negative, the patient was
taken off broad spectrum antibiotics and placed on Bactrim
and steroids, to be continued for a 21 day course.

When the patient was re-intubated for hypoxic respiratory
failure on 2005-01-17 00:00:00, his antibiotic coverage was once again
broadened by adding vancomycin and Ceftriaxone to cover for a
possible ventilator >......<pneumonia, however, follow-up
culture date and repeat BAL was once again only positive for
PCP by immunofluorescence and all other culture data was
negative.  Therefore, the patient was taken off vancomycin
and Ceftriaxone and continued on the Bactrim.

The patient's hemodynamics markedly improved after extubation
on 2005-01-17 00:00:00, and the patient started auto diuresing with
very brisk urine output, with maintaining his blood
pressures.

3.  Anal rectal herpes infection:  The patient was started on
acyclovir, as cultures of his anal rectal lesions were
positive for herpes simplex type 2.  The patient is to
continue on a course of acyclovir for several months as
dictated by the Infectious Disease Department.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was placed on an intensive
insulin regimen to maintain normal glycemia during his
Intensive Care Unit course.  Towards the end of his Intensive
Care Unit course, the patient was not requiring any insulin
to maintain normal glycemia and regular insulin sliding scale
was discontinued.  The patient was continued on Synthroid for
hypothyroidism.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had rising liver function
tests, amylase and lipase during his hospitalization.
Possible differential diagnosis for his elevated LFTs and
pancreatic enzymes included Bactrim causing intrahepatic
cholestasis and pancreatitis, common bile duct stone, or AMI
infection.  During his Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient
also admitted to having hepatitis C infection, but did not
want us to tell his parents about this. Further imaging was
deferred, as the patient was not complaining of abdominal
pain and his LFTs, amylase and lipase were stably elevated.
Hepatitis A and B serologies were checked, along with
hepatitis C viral load, toxoplasma and CMV antibody.  These
were all pending at the time of transfer out of the Intensive
Care Unit.  Fungal isolator blood cultures had been ordered
several times during the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay
and were all pending.

6.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was
placed on tube feeds while intubated.  After extubation, the
patient was slowly started on a house diet with Boost
supplements, and electrolytes were repleted as needed.

7.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was continued on a proton pump
inhibitor, which was increased to twice daily secondary to
heartburn type symptoms.  Once the patient was getting out of
bed and was more active, subcutaneous heparin was
discontinued.

8.  Intravenous access:  The patient had a triple lumen
catheter central line while intubated which was discontinued
after extubation.  He thereafter, had his A line discontinued
once his oxygenation stabilized.  A midline was placed for
intravenous access.

9.  Communication:  The patient's mother would visit almost
on a daily basis, and was frequently updated on her sons
clinical status.

THIS IS THE END OF THE DICTATION OF HOSPITAL COURSE ON
PATIENT Carisma Foskey FROM 2005-01-17 00:00:00 THROUGH 2005-01-17 00:00:00.
