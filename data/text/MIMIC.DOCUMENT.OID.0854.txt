Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
Patient presented with a hematocrit of 21 down from her baseline
of ~35. Gastroenterology was consulted and reported that this
was a likely diverticular bleed given her history of
diverticulosis on colonoscopies in the past. She was to be
treated conservatively with transfusions and monitoring. She
received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells following
admission and had an appropriate HCT bump to 31.6. Serial HCTs
on 2010-04-03 00:00:00 revealed stabilized of her HCT at ~30 prior to
transfer to the floor.  Her initial episode of chest pain in the
ED was not repeated following resuscitation with PRBCs. She had
a rule out for MI with three serial sets of cardiac enzymes with
downtrending CKs and normal troponins throughout. Concerning her
chronic kidney disease, at presentation she was at her baseline
Cr of approximately 1.3 and this fell to 1.1 on morning prior to
transfer out of MICU. Given her unknown volume status, her home
antihypertensives were initially held and after assurance of
stable hemodynamics, she was restarted on lisinopril. Concerning
her diabetes, she was managed with a lower dose of lantus given
that she was NPO when presenting to the unit. After
stabilization of her HCT, she began a diet of clears that was to
be advanced as tolerated. In the MICU the patient had no bowel
movements and was hemodynamically stable throughout her stay in
the MICU. She was feeling well when transferred out of the MICU.
