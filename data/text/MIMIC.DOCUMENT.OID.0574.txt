History of Present Illness:
62 yr old male with 3VD, CHF 20-25% with 3-4+ MR, bilateral
carotid stenoses s/p L ICA stent now awaiting CABG/MVR who
presented with chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pt states

has had these episodes of chest pain x 2 weeks.  He has also
noted that his lower ext swelling has gotten worse over the past
few days as well.  +2-pillow orthopnea, no PND.
Two days prior to admission, pt presented to 123 Any St.
complaining of lower abd pain, described as a sharp pain across
his lower abdomen, associated with nausea, vomiting and dry
heaves.  LFTs, amylase and lipase were found to be elevated.

pathology.  Pt has no hx of gallstones, no hx of alcohol use; he
has been taking tylenol (6 extra strength tabs/day).  Pt states
that his abd pain went away after some fluids.

** Chest X-Ray:

.
** RUQ U/S:
1. No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
2. Simple right renal cyst.
.
** Cardiac Cath:
1. Resting hemodynamics on IABP revealed significantly
elevated right (RA mean 19 mm Hg, RVEDP 21 mm Hg) and left (PCWP
mean 22
mm Hg) sided filing pressures. The C.I was significantly reduced
(1.2
L/imn/m2).
2. IABP was placed: Augmented DP 140, Unloaded systolic 90,
Unassisted
systolic 100, mean BP 90.
3. Selective coronary angiography of only the left system
revealed a 80%
ostial LM, 100% proximally occluded LCX, 90% mid LAD stenosis,
80%
distal LAD stenosis. The RCA was known to be T.O and was not
engaged
(RCA was filling viw left to right collaterals).
4. Successful stenting of the LM with two overlapping Cypher DES
(3.5x13
and 3.5x8mm, postdilated to 3.75) (See PTCA comments).
5. Successful stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.5x18mm Cypher DES

postdilated to 3.75 (See PTCA comments).
6. Successful stenting of the distal LAD with a 2.5x8mm Cypher
DES (See
PTCA comments).
7. Abdominal aortography revealed mild distal disease with no
critical
lesions in the iliacs and common femorals.
.
** Chest CT:
1) Bronchiectasis and peribronchial opacity that is most
prominent within the posterior right lower lobe with associated
small effusions. This finding is suggestive of pneumonia.
Atelectasis is a less likely consideration. A similar lesser
amount of opacity is seen within the posterior left upper lobe.
2) An intraaortic balloon [**Year/Month/Day 4516**] is in place with its distal tip
below the carina. The inflated balloon in place at the origin of
the celiac axis.
3) Unchanged enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
4) Emphysema.
5) Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion.
.
** ECHO:
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include diffuse hypokinesis
with anteroseptal and apical akinesis, basal to mid inferior
akinesis and basal inferolateral akinesis. No apical thrombus
seen (cannot definitively exclude). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline preserved. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Mitral regurgitation
increases to moderate to severe (3+) with the intra-aortic
balloon [**Year/Month/Day 4516**] off. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. EF < 15%
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 yr old male with severe 3VD, MR, CHF now s/p L ICA
stent, awaiting CABG admitted for chest pain and shortness of
breath
.
1. CAD, chest pain:  Given the pt's chest pain and shortness of
breath, a CTA was done and ruled out PE.  Pt was initially
scheduled for elective cath with stenting of the LAD to
determine whether this would improve his EF.  If his EF
improved, then the plan would be to pursue MVR and CABG.  Given
his presentation of recurrent chest pain his elective cath was
moved up.  On admission, EKG was noted to have old TWI in the
inferior leads and a troponin of 0.03 so heparin was started
given his extensive cardiac hx.  Pt went to cardiac cath on
hospital day #3 which revealed 80% LM, 90% LAD, 100% LCx and
100% RCA.  Pt then underwent PTCA with cypher stent placed to
80% ostial LM lesion and cypher stent x 2 to LAD.  Due to a
severely depressed cardiac index, a balloon [**Year/Month/Day 4516**] was placed and
the pt was started on Dobutamine.  During cath, pt received 60mg
of IV lasix and he diuresed 2L.  In CCU, pt continued to diurese
another 8L with lasix and he was weaned off the dobutamine and
IABP.  The cardiac surgery team evaluated the pt and determined
that he was not a surgical candidate at the time due to his
concurrent tobacco abuse.  They recommended smoking cessation
and medical management.  He was continued on ASA, plavix,
beta-blocker, ACE-I, imdur and statin.
.
2. Roggenbuck, [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20-30%:  Pt's CHF is multifactorial including
ischemia (3VD) and severe MR.  As above, pt was maintained on
dobutamine and an IABP in the CCU for aggressive diuresis and
diuresed approximately 10L.  He was evaluted but CT surgery but
was not a surgery candidate at the time.  He was loaded on
digoxin in the CCU and continued on BB, lasix and
spironolactone.  A repeat echo after his cath showed a further
decreased EF of <15%.
.
3. Elevated LFTs/amylase/lipase: Pt admits to a hx of lower abd
pain associated with nausea and vomiting however, the location
of the pain was not typical for pancreatitis and pt was able to
tolerate po's.  Other etiologies included medication-related,
especially lipitor, though would not expect elevated pancreatic
enzymes.  Also possible would be a passed gallstone, RUQ U/S
negative.  Pt with neg hepatitis panel, EBV, toxo, CMV IgM in
2005-01-06 00:00:00 when being evaluated for heart transplant and were
negative again when rechecked.  All enzymes trended down and
there was still no clear etiology of his elevated LFTs on day of
discharge.
.
3. ARF: Urine lytes indicated that the pt was pre-renal
secondary to poor forward flow.  His creatinine improved over
his hospital stay as his cardiac medications were adjusted to
increase flow to the kidney.
.
4. Hyponatremia: Likely 2005-01-06 00:00:00 CHF and it resolved over the
hospital stay.
.
5. DM: Pt was on an insulin drip in the CCU and then continued
on his home dose of NPH while on the floor.
