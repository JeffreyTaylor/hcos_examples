Attending:Candra Spoelhof
Chief Complaint:
Left Total Knee Replacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Total Knee Replacement


History of Present Illness:
57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for
severe bilateral arthritis S/P R TKR in 2007-02-17 00:00:00; CAD S/P MI
(remote); recurrent DVT and PE and atrial fibrillation, on
Coumadin; hypertension; CHF, diastolic and systolic; obstructive
sleep apnea, on BiPAP; severe COPD on 4L home O2; history of
heavy tobacco abuse; systemic lupus now in remission; diabetes;
hepatitis C; colon cancer (resected); and peripheral neuropathy.
 He is being admitted for an elective left total knee
replacement, but given his complex medical problems, it was felt
he should be admitted to medicine pre-operatively.  When he had
his right TKR in 2007-02-17 00:00:00 he was transferred to medicine post-op for
management of fluid overload and anticoagulation.  He had a COPD
exacerbation 2007-02-17 00:00:00 that was treated with Abx.  His current
surgery was supposed to be done 2007-02-17 00:00:00, but when admitted pre-op
was found to have PNA, treated with ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime.
 Surgery was rescheduled to 2007-02-17 00:00:00.
.
On review of systems here he denies cough, fever, chills,
vomiting, constipation, orthopnea, increased dyspnea on exertion
or dysuria.  He does use 4L home O2, but has no change in his
requirements.  He has chronic knee pain and neuropathy for which
he takes methadone every 6 hours.

Pre-Op ECG (2007-02-17 00:00:00):
Atrial fibrillation with single wide complex beat, possibly
ventricular.
ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2007-02-17 00:00:00
the wide
complex beat is new.

Pre-Op CXR (2007-02-17 00:00:00):
FINDINGS: Comparison made to 2007-02-17 00:00:00. Moderate cardiac
enlargement
is unchanged, without evidence of increased pulmonary
vascularity, or
pulmonary edema. Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged cardiomegaly.

Final Report
LEFT KNEE 2007-02-17 00:00:00
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Total knee replacement.
FINDINGS:
Three views of the left knee are compared to the prior study
from 2007-02-17 00:00:00.
These demonstrate interval placement of total left knee
arthroplasty in near
anatomic alignment without hardware complication at this time.
Surgical
staples are present. There are post-surgical changes in the soft
tissues.
Small joint effusion is present.

.
2007-02-17 00:00:00: Lower extrem u/s: negative for DVT (123 Any St. report)
.
CXR (2007-02-17 00:00:00):
There is interval improvement of pulmonary edema with still
present right
perihilar opacity as well as minimal left perihilar opacity,
most likely
representing residue of the infection. Attention on the
subsequent study is recommended to exclude the possibility of
developing infection. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal
silhouette is stable. No ap[** Location **]ble pleural effusion is
present, although note is made that the left costophrenic angle
was excluded from the field of view. There is no pneumothorax.

CXR (2007-02-17 00:00:00):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2007-02-17 00:00:00, there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal elevation of
pulmonary
venous pressure. The perihilar opacities persist, most likely
representing
residual of infection.
Impression: No evidence of acute pneumonia or pleural effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
57yo man with extensive past-medical history including CHF,
COPD, Afib on Coumadin and history of difficult peri-operatively
in the past, admitted pre-operatively in preparation for left
TKR.

#. Left Total Knee Replacement: Prior to the surgery, warfarin
was discontinued and heparin gtt was started. The patient was
sent to surgery on 2007-02-17 00:00:00 for Left Total Knee Replacement.
There were no complications during the surgery. Post-operatively
the patient's recovery in the PACU was complicated with fevers
to 103, rigors, elevated HRs to 110s and SBP to 180s with brief
O2 desaturation to 70s that returned to the low 90s about 7
hours post-operatively. There was a question of whether the
etiology was sepsis vs. withdrawal (Benzo/EtOH - there was no
history of EtOH recently per patient and wife) vs. Neuroleptic
malignant syndrome vs. PE. PE did not seem likely as the patient
did not show signs right heart strain on ECG. As a result the
patient was transferred to the MICU where esmolol was started
and the patient's BP/HR improved. Labs were sent and the patient
was placed on CIWA scale, on which he consistently had a score
of 0. Once the patient was stabilized, the patient was sent back
to the floor where he continued to have fevers to 101.
Pan-cultures were sent, all of which have been negative to date.
No antibiotics were started, and the patient defervesced on his
own. The fevers were thought to be due to possibly a combination
of post-operative fevers and atelectasis. The patient had a drop
in his hct from his baseline of 32. Hemolysis labs were done,
which were negative, and the surgical site did not indicate a
hematoma. Subsequently, the patient's hct began to rise with hct
on discharge of 25.2. The patient's hct will need to be
monitored during rehabilitation, and transfusion may be required
if the patient's hct falls below 24. The patient is on
long-standing methadone. For adequate pain control
post-operatively, the patient was started on Dilaudid 1mg q6prn.

.
#. Diastolic CHF:
The patient takes high doses of furosemide at home TID. The
patient has had difficulty peri-operatively with fluid overload
in the past, thus careful monitoring of his fluid was done
during this surgery. Post-operatively he appeared euvolemic. At
discharge, his home dose of Lasix was re-started, which he
seemed to tolerate well. His home medications of carvedilol and
isosorbide were continued. Captopril dose was reduced in half to
6.25 TID from 12.5 TID. The patient may be up-titrated to his
home dose of captopril in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Afib/History of PE & DVT/anticoagulation:
The patient suffers from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and also
has a history of PE and DVTs. The patient's warfarin was stopped
1 day prior to admission. On admission he was started on heparin
gtt, which was discontinued on the day of surgery.
Post-operatively heparin gtt was restarted and continued while
the patient was bridged to coumadin. The patient was discharged
on his home dose of coumadin on 17.5mg. At discharge, the
patient had INR of 1.5, and as a result the patient was started
on lovenox 100mg UPMCE. Lovenox should be discontinued once the
patient reaches his goal INR of 2007-02-17 00:00:00 which should be checked at
his rehab.
.
#. Diabetes: During the UPMCE hospital course, the patient's
metformin and glipizide were held and the patient was started on
a Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale. At discharge, the patient was
restarted on metformin and glipizide. He should have his sugars
checks at the rehab.
.
#. Hypertension
The patient was continued on home doses of carvedilol and
isosorbide dinitrate. Captopril was reduced in half as stated
above. The captopril may be up-titrated to his home dose in the
outpatient setting.

#. COPD: At baseline, the patient is on 4L of 02 at home. The
patient required the same amount of 02 during the hospital
course and the patient's home nebulizers and bronchodilators
were continued.
.
#. Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient suffers from sleep
apnea, and had brought his home Bipap machine, which he used
during the course of his hospital stay.
.
#. Insomnia: The patient suffers from insomnia and was continued
on his home dose of tanazidine and oxazepam.
.
#. SLE: The patient suffers from SLE, and was continued on his
home dose of plaquenil.
.
Patient was Full Code during this admission, and his wife was
the main person of contact.

stabilized. Once you were brought back to the floor, you
continued to have fevers, but they subsided. An infection was
not thought to be the cause of your fevers and you did not need
antibiotics. By discharge you were not having fevers and you
were feeling better. You were also restarted on all your home
medications at home dosages. Your pain was in control.
