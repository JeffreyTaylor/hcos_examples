Cardiac Echo 2005-03-14 00:00:00:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2005-03-14 00:00:00, the
severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
.
CXR 2005-03-14 00:00:00
Lung volumes are maintained following tracheal extubation.
Extensive
bilateral pulmonary consolidation is heterogeneous and also has
varied in
radiodensity to different degrees in separate areas over the
past two days. I suspect much of the abnormality is edema, but
pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumonia could be making a
contribution. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable and small
bilateral pleural effusions have developed since the earliest
studies on 2005-03-14 00:00:00. Transvenous right atrial and right
ventricular pacer leads in standard placements. No pneumothorax.

.
EKG 2005-03-14 00:00:00:
A-V sequentially paced rhythm with intrinsic A-V conduction and
right
bundle-branch block configuration. Compared to the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2005-03-14 00:00:00 there is no diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Azpeitia is a pleasant 87-year-old woman with CAD, CHF,
HTN, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer, moderate-severe AS who
presented to UPMCE on 2005-03-14 00:00:00 with acute respiratory distress.
Due to her poor respiratory status she was intubated in the
emergency department and admitted to the medical intensive care
unit. On 2005-03-14 00:00:00, her respiratory status had improved and she was
successfully extubated. On 2005-03-14 00:00:00, she was transferred to the
cardiology service. Her brief hospital course was notable for:
.
# ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS:  Acute pulmonary edema was
suspected as the most likely etiology of the patient's acute
respiratory distress, in setting of diastolic dysfunction and
moderate-severe AS.  Initially, there was concern for myocardial
infarction however, she was ultimately ruled out with three sets
of negative cardiac enzymes. There was also concern for
pneumonia and initially Ms. Azpeitia was put on antibiotics.
However, due to lack of fever, leukocytosis, and marked clinical
improvement, antibiotics were discontinued on 2005-03-14 00:00:00.  In the
MICU, Ms. Azpeitia was diuresed with 60 IV lasix x 1, and on
2005-03-14 00:00:00 was restarted on her home regimen of 80 mg PO lasix. An
arterial line was placed on 2005-03-14 00:00:00 without incident, for close
BP observation, and this was discontinued on 2005-03-14 00:00:00, prior to
transfer to the floor. She was successfully extubated on 2005-03-14 00:00:00.
.
Upon arrival on medicine floor, Ms. Azpeitia was started on
Torsemide (eventually uptitrated to 40mg UPMCE) with good urine
output and diminishment of rales on lung exam.  (Patient was
diuresed with caution in light of mod-severe AS).  SP02
continued to be 92-95% on 2L nasal cannula.  She was also
started on Lisinopril 20mg QD for better BP control and
afterload reduction.  Better BP control will help with pulmonary
edema, but without valvular repair, this issue cannot be
entirely corrected.  Both the family and the patient are aware
of this.
.
# HYPERTENSION: During her hospitalization, the patient was
noted to have labile blood pressures ranging from hypo to
hypertensive. Hypotensive episodes occured in the setting of
getting propofol for sedation while intubated, and hypertensive
episodes occured primarily in the settings of anxiety, and after
extubation.  In the MICU, Ms. Azpeitia was initially started on
captopril, but this was changed to Lisinopril on the medicine
floor.  Her home clonadine was stopped; home Lopressor was
switched to Carvedilol for better alpha blockage.  Torsemide
40mg UPMCE was started as above.  Ms. Azpeitia was also given
lorazepam prn anxiety.
.
# Azpeitia: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9 in the
setting of diuresis.  It trended down to 1.0 on day of
discharge.
.
# CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease. No history of chest
pain and cardiac biomarkers were present.  EKG did not reveal
any ST wave changes, though it did show some pacing
irregularities.  ASA and simvastatin were continued.  Ms.
Hopson Azpeitia was discharged on ASA, simvastatin, and ACE-I.
.
# MODERATE-SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS:  Ms. Azpeitia had increasing
dyspnea prior to admission, but no known history of chest pain
or syncope.  And ECHO from 2005-03-14 00:00:00 shows an LVEF of 55% and an
aortic valve area of 0.8cm2.  Ms. Azpeitia prefers medical
management of AS and does not want surgery.  Her Imdur was
stopped during admission and she was diuresis cautiously as AS
makes her preload dependent.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Levothyroxine was continued at 50mcg daily.
.
# RATE:  Ms. Azpeitia has a history of Afib and sick sinus
syndrome s/p PPM.  Pacemaker was interrogated by EP during
admission and some changes were made.  Ms. Azpeitia should
follow up with Device Clinic in 1 month and Dr. Lassie Grissman on
2005-03-14 00:00:00.  She was discharged on Amiodarone and Carvedilol.
.
#GOUT:  After aggressive diuresis, Ms. Azpeitia complained of
symptoms consistent with gouty flare in left big toe.
Colchicine was started at 0.6mg QD and pain begam to subside.
Colchicine was continued on discharge.  Outpatient management of
gout is deferred to PCP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Azpeitia,

It was a pleasure taking care of you on this admission.  You
came to the hospital because you were having shortness of
breath.  In the Emergency Department your oxygen level was found
to be very low and your blood pressure very high.  You were
intubated (put on a ventilator) and sent to the intensive care
unit.  We think that you had trouble Azpeitia because your
blood pressure was high which, in relation to your other cardiac
issues, ultimately caused fluid to accumulate in your lungs.
.
The following changes were made to your medications in order to
ensure better control of your blood pressure in the setting of
your aortic stenosis.  We also started a medication to help with
your gout.
1.  STOP taking Imdur 60mg daily
2.  STOP taking Lopressor 50 mg twice a day
3.  STOP taking Lasix 80mg daily
4.  STOP taking Clonidine
5.  START taking Carvedilol 12.5mg twice a day
6.  START taking Lisinopril 20mg daily
7.  START colchicine 0.6mg daily (for gout)
8.  START Torsemide 40mg twice a day
.
At the rehab facility you will also receive Colace and Senna (to
help you move your bowels), Tylenol as needed for pain, oxygen,
and Heparin three times daily to prevent blood clots.
.
You will need to have your chemistry (electrolytes) checked in
one week because of some of the medications we are starting.
.
Please keep all of your doctors' appointments.  Please take all
of your medications as prescribed.
.
Weigh yourself every day and call your doctor if you gain more
than 3 pounds.
.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop
shortness of breath, chest pain, severe headache, bright red
blood in your stool, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
fever or any other concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your PCP Azpeitia. Azpeitia at test@mail.com to make an
appointment in 2005-03-14 00:00:00 weeks after you are discharged from the
rehabilitation facility.

You will be called by the Device Clinic for an outpatient
interrogation of your pacemaker one month after discharge.
