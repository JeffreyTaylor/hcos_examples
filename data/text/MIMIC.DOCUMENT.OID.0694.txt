Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Kurland was admitted and underwent a successful TURP on
2009-11-10 00:00:00.  He was transferred to the floor post-operatively.  He
had no pain control issues and onlly required 1 dose of
morphine.  In the early morning of POD1 he was triggered for a
systolic blood pressure of 88 when he had 123 Any St.usly been
averaging 100-110.  Later that day the patient became somnolent
and hard to arouse.  On exam he withdrew and localized to pain
bilaterally, but would not wake up.  His vital signs were stable
and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.  His medication
list was reviewed and he had received a total of 450mg of
amitriptyline and 3.0mg of klonopin.  At this point, multiple
attempts were made to contact his primary care physician to
verify his home medications and their doses.  He was triggered
again by the nursing staff for mental status changes.  A
complete work-up was initiated at this time including full labs,
ABG, CXR, EKG, and a neurology consult.  CXR revealed low lung
volumes otherwise normal.  The ABG and labs were normal.  His
EKG and cardiac enzymes were normal.  During this work up his
systolic blood pressure dropped to a low of 78.  He was bolused
with normal saline, pan-cultured, and ampicillin and gentamicin
were started empirically for possible sepsis.  At this point his
mental status was improving, he was arousable, was talking in
Russian, and able to follow simple commands like squeezing
fingers and opening his eyes.  Neurology evaluated the patient
and they were finally able to get in touch with a staff member
from Dr.Damarien Kurland office and his medication list was reviewed,
which revealed that the patient stated he was taking
amitriptyline 150mg TID when in reality he was only supposed to
be taking 25mg UPMCE.  They felt that his hypotension and
somnolence were most likely secondary to TCA overdose in the
light of his work-up coming back negative and his slight
improvement in mental status.  Due to TCA overdose causing
arrythmias, he was transferred to the intensive care unit for
close cardiac monitoring overnight.  His foley catheter was
replaced prior to transfer to the ICU.  His ICU course can be
reviewed below.  On POD2 in the ICU his mental status was back
to baseline.  His labwork and EKG's remained normal.  His foley
was discontinued and he voided without difficulty.  He was
tolerating a regular diet and ambulating without difficulty.
His medication list was reviewed with the patient and a Russian
interpreter.  He was told of his need for close follow up with
his primary care physician.  Damarien Kurland was given a correct list of his
medications and their correct dosing and instructed to carry
this with him at all times to prevent any confusion in the
future.  He was instructed on his follow up with Dr. Daylani Baumgarth.  His
only questions were about his activity level and his
prescriptions which were answered accordingly.  He is discharged
in good condition.

UPMCE Course 2009-11-10 00:00:00:
1. Decreased mental status: Differential included toxic
encephalopathy from TCA overdose (patient quoted physician wrong
home dose), metabolic from infection (sepsis) though he is
afebrile with a stable WBC count. Stroke is less likely given
relatively normal neuro exam. Seizure less likely. Hypoperfusion
from hypotension possible.
- consulted toxicology, who suggested monitoring with serial
EKG's to ensure QRS duration less than 100ms, no indication for
activated charcoal as last dose was at 9AM, and bicarb drip only
indicated if QRS greater than 100ms. Therefore, q2h EKGs were
performed with QRSs 88-90ms. His TCA was held and on the
following morning, patient's mental status was back to baseline
and no events were noted on telemetry.  Patient had an EKG with
normal QRS intervals.
- Patient also was treated for possible infection with one dose
of ampicillin and gentamycin.  Urine and blood cultures ordered
and showed no growth at day 1. Patient improved so rapidly from
the suspected TCA overdose that he recieved no further
antibiotics.
.
2. Relative Hypotension: Differential included medication
effect, hemorrhage, sepsis.  Hypotension resolved with IVF
boluses and holding of TCA.
.
3. BPH s/p TURP: continued home meds and pyridium.  Continuous
bladder irrigation was held to evaluate urine output.  Patient
was voiding after foley removal on discharge.
.
4. Ambulation: Patient was able to ambulate around unit
unassisted prior to discharge home.
.
5. Depression: Home doses were resumed on discharge.
