PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs.  Heart rate of 96; blood
pressure of 148/78.  Her abdomen had trace tenderness in the
left lower quadrant, but otherwise her examination was
benign.

LABORATORY:  On admission, demonstrated a hematocrit of 29.9,
476 platelets, PT of 12.4, PTT of 22.2 and INR of 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was then admitted to the
Medical Service.  A GI consultation was obtained and the
patient was transfused twice.  The patient was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation of her
bleeding.

A colonometry was performed on the 2006-04-07 00:00:00, which
demonstrated multiple diverticula with large openings into
the sigmoid colon, descending colon and transverse colon.
The patient underwent the procedure by Interventional
Radiology.  The patient underwent this procedure by
Interventional Radiology for embolization, but was not
actively bleeding on the 2006-04-07 00:00:00, and then was referred
to the General Surgery Service.

By the time she was seen by the General Surgery Service, she
had been transfused with five units of packed red blood cells
with her hematocrits having dropped to 16.8 and having been
recovered to 26.4 as of 1 a.m. on 2006-04-07 00:00:00.  The patient
underwent a tagged red blood cell scan demonstrated a right
sided source in the colon and the patient was then taken to
the Operating Room on the 28th for an extended right
hemicolectomy by Dr. Aurore Tycz.  During the operation, she
received three liters of crystalloid and had a urine output
of 1000 cc and estimated blood loss of 200 cc.  It was noted
that the transverse colon was filled with blood and there
were multiple diverticula and the colon was opened to notice
suspicious diverticula plus/minus ulcer with mass inside, in
the excised portion.

The patient was then transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  Postoperatively, the patient was stable and she
received multiple boluses of lactated Ringer's and packed red
blood cells during her unit stay, but otherwise her unit stay
was unremarkable.  She was extubated and then transferred to
the floor on 2006-04-07 00:00:00.

On 2006-04-07 00:00:00, the patient went to the bathroom and noted
blood in the toilet which was non-witnessed.  She had a Foley
catheter placed, was bolused with 1500 of lactated Ringer's
and serial hematocrits were taken.  Her serial hematocrits
over the remainder of the day remained in the low 30's
between 31 to 33, and while the patient was tachycardic at
113 but responded to boluses and her heart rate decreased to
the high 90s as her admission vital signs were notable for.

Urinalysis demonstrated a few bacteria, 2006-04-07 00:00:00 white cells and
the patient has been started on Ciprofloxacin during that
time.  EKG demonstrated the possibility of multi-focal atrial
tachycardia with no ST or T wave changes.

The patient continued to pass bloody stools but had five
serial hematocrits drawn with no change even with hydration.
It was felt that she was passing all the old blood that had
been seen during the operation.  The patient's diet was
advanced.  Her CVL was discontinued.  The Foley catheter was
again discontinued and her intravenous fluids were Heparin
locked.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  She will be discharged with follow-up scheduled with Dr.
Gattuso in one to two weeks.
2.  Follow-up with her primary care provider as soon as
possible.

her urinary tract infection.
