Admission Date:  2013-09-13 00:00:00       Discharge Date:  2013-09-13 00:00:00

Date of Birth: 1995-09-07 00:00:00 00:00:00       Sex:  F

Service:  UPMCE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
woman who has a past medical history dominated by severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with OSA, as well as
CAD, and CHF.  The patient was brought to the emergency
department this AM by her son, after she awakened with severe
shortness of breath.  She was discharged from UPMCE (UPMCE
in 123 Any St.).  Two weeks ago, doing well overall, with
increased activity level and no chest pain or resting
dyspnea.  She denied recent fever of chills.  She has a cough
at baseline.

She was last hospitalized in late 2013-09-13 00:00:00 with fatigue and
later chest pain; she underwent catheterization and stenting
of 90% lesions of RCA and left circumflex.  She went to the
UPMCE for rehabilitation as above.  She was doing well and
continued to do well at home.  She denies nausea, vomiting,
or chest pain with present illness.  She was found to be
febrile in the emergency department with striking
leukocytosis and new right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest
x-ray.

Chest x-ray also was consistent with mild CHF.  The tachypnea
and desaturation had responded to repeated medications and
increased oxygen.  In the emergency department, she was
initially treated with nebulizers with some mild improvement,
however, she acutely worsened with increasing shortness of
breath, increased systolic blood pressure to the 200s and
heart rate to the 130s sinus tachycardia.

EKG showed ST segment depression in the lateral leads.  She
was given aspirin, IV Lopressor, nitropaste, morphine, and 40
IV Lasix with good response.  The ST segment depression
resolved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with 100 plus pack
year smoking history, resulting in multiple hospitalizations.
2.  OSA.  The patient has documented sleep apnea.  The
patient is on home oxygen and CPAP.  The patient reports not
using the CPAP due to relative intolerance.
3.  She has both restrictive and obstruction defects on PFTs
and she has been dependent on oral steroids.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She has a history of diabetes
mellitus requiring treatment in the early 2013-09-13 00:00:00.  She is
maintained on insulin b.i.d. with a sliding scale.
5.  Glucose control has been fair at best over time.
6.  Coronary artery disease.  Noteworthy for myocardial
infarction and PTCA in 2013-09-13 00:00:00.  She had echocardiogram in the
mid 2013-09-13 00:00:00 showing good function, but with worsening
exertional chest pain in 2013-09-13 00:00:00.  She underwent endotracheal
MIBI with an anterior defect as identified on catheterization
to have 100% LAD lesions for which PTCA was performed.  She
ultimately redeveloped a restenosis of the stent placement
complicated by Dfib.  ETT MIBI on 2013-09-13 00:00:00 showed a good EF
and equivocal EKG changes with anginal symptoms.  She
underwent catheterization and angioplasty of two vessels, RCA
and proximal LAD in 2013-09-13 00:00:00.  She developed unstable
coronary syndrome in 2013-09-13 00:00:00.  She underwent repeat
catheterization and another PTCA of the right (PDA).  Latest
dobutamine MIBI showed inferior ischemia.  Most recent
cardiac intervention as described above.
7.  Osteoporosis with recurrent back pain and dorsal
compression fractures.  She has had bilateral hip fractures
and THRs, hospitalized twice for rehabilitation at UPMCE in 2013-09-13 00:00:00 and earlier this year times two, last at
UPMCE.
8.  Chronic pain.  She is on Percocet for chronic pain.
9.  Anxiety disorder.
10. Depression.
11. Longstanding chronic abdominal pain.
12. Chronic constipation.
13. Hypercholesterolemia, status post bilateral cataract
surgery with limited vision in one eye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
The patient is an obese Cushingoid woman lying semiupright in
bed at rest.  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 108, blood pressure 174/74,
temperature 101.6, oxygen saturation 91% on three liters.
SKIN:  Scattered abdominal striae and few resolving
ecchymoses.  HEENT:  No overt sinus tenderness.  EOMI:
conjugates and grossly full.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Mild
nasal congestion.  Oropharynx:  There is normal, but,
however, dry mucosa.  NECK:  Supple, slightly reduced range
of motion.  CHEST:  Dorsal kyphosis with very faint breath
sounds throughout; coarse scattered wheezes and rhonchi
especially anteriorly; reduced breath sounds in the right
round ligament with no obvious consolidation, but harsh
crackles extreme base, no egophony.  HEART:  Regular, normal
S1 and S2.  No obvious gallops.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur
at the upper lobe and upper right sternal border.  PMI
slightly laterally displaced.  Hyperdynamic.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
obese, diffuse minimal tenderness less than baseline, loud
bowel sounds, no overt masses are ap123 Any St.ted.  EXTREMITIES:
Striking distal wasting, no edema.  No acute joint
inflammation.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is dozing, but
arousable and responsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data showed a white count of
216.5, hematocrit 30.9, platelet count 497,000.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 25, BUN 15,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 100.  ABG on three liters was 7.5,
38, 60.  CK was 94.  Troponin I less than 0.3.  Urinalysis
negative for nitrite, negative for leukocyte esterase, 3 to 5
white blood cells, no red blood cells, many bacteria, 6 to 10
squamous cells.  Chest x-ray disclosed new right basilar
consolidation, no overt CHF, small pleural effusion.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at a 120 beats per minute, left
axis deviation, which was old.  A second EKG disclosed sinus
tachycardia at 125 beats per minute, new 1 mm ST segment
depressions in V4 through V6.  A third EKG showed that the ST
depressions now resolved and the heart rate had decreased to
110.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was noted to have acute onset
of dyspnea with fever and evidence on examination and chest
x-ray of likely new right lower lobe pneumonia against the
backdrop of severe COPD/OSA and CHF.  The patient showed
initial improvement in the emergency department, but worsened
this afternoon, suggestive of pulmonary edema superimposed on
pneumonia.  She was also noted to have lateral EKG changes.

The patient was admitted to the MICU for stabilization and
further evaluation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  by systems.

PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have an acute
decompensation secondary to a combination of right lower lobe
pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and
CHF.  She was treated for COPD exacerbation with steroids and
nebulizer treatments.  She was treated for a presumed
community-acquired pneumonia with Levofloxacin.  PE was
thought to be unlikely due to the patient's wheezing and
evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray.

On 2013-09-13 00:00:00, the patient was changed to PO steroids.  She
was administered CPAP as tolerated.  She remained in the MICU
until 2013-09-13 00:00:00, when she was then transferred to the
floor.  Chest x-ray done on 2013-09-13 00:00:00, the day of
discharge, revealed an interval improvement in the
collapse/consolidation in the lung bases and improvement in
her heart failure.

CARDIAC:
A.  Ischemia.  The patient was initially noted to have ST
segment depressions, 1 mm V4 through V6.  The EKG changes
resolved.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled times three and she
ruled out for myocardial infarction.   The patient was
continued on aspirin and statins.

B.  Pump.  The patient was aggressively diuresed in the ICU.
She continued on her ACE inhibitor.  She was then put on her
outpatient Lasix dose of 40 mg PO b.i.d.  On 2013-09-13 00:00:00,
the patient had undergone blood transfusion with two units of
packed red blood cells.  She developed mild CHF following the
transfusion, administered 80 mg IV Lasix.  As noted above,
chest x-ray done on 2013-09-13 00:00:00, the day of discharge, noted
improvement in the patient's CHF.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially had a low-grade
temperature with a leukocytosis and evidence of right lower
lobe consolidation.  She was administered Levofloxacin for
treatment of a community-acquired pneumonia.  She will
complete a 14-day course of Levofloxacin.  She was also
initially administered Vancomycin for right lower extremity
cellulitis.  The Vancomycin was discontinued on 2013-09-13 00:00:00.
Since the right lower extremity skin changes were attributed
to steroids, rather than infection, blood, urine, and sputum
cultures were sent.  All cultures were no growth to date.
Sputum was contaminated with polymicrobial growth.

GI:  The patient has a history of constipation and chronic
abdominal pain.  She was treated with Protonix, Reglan, and
the bowel regimen, which consisted of Colace, Senna, and
Lactulose.  The patient continued to be constipated during
her hospitalization and this issue should be addressed in the
rehabilitation facility.  Administration of narcotics should
be limited.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient has diabetes mellitus.  She continued
on her outpatient insulin regimen.  She was given 70 units
NPH in the morning, 10 units at night, and she was placed on
a sliding scale.

PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has history of anxiety and
depression.  She continued on her Zoloft, Risperdal, and
Klonopin.

PAIN CONTROL:  The patient has a history of chronic abdominal
pain and chronic narcotic use.  She has history of bilateral
hip fractures and total hip replacement.  Pain control was
with Percocet.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
initially given clears, diet, but then advanced to diabetic
diet.  The nutrition service followed the patient during her
hospitalization.

HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was administered 5000 units
subcutaneous heparin b.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis.  On 2013-09-13 00:00:00, she was noted to have a hematocrit of 27.2.  She was
transfused two units of packed red blood cells.  The
hematocrit should be maintained over 30 due to her history of
coronary artery disease.

On 2013-09-13 00:00:00, the day of discharge, the hematocrit was
37.2.

PT:  The patient was seen by the Physical Therapy Department
during her hospitalization.  She should continue to work with
physical therapy while at rehabilitation.

The patient is full code.
