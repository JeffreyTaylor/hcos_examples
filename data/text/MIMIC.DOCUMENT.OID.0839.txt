HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Bera is a 71-year-old
male with an extensive cardiac history.  His last cardiac
catheterization was 2006-12-31 00:00:00 during which he had a stent to his
D1 and presented with unstable angina.  Patient describes
stable angina as substernal chest pain with walking "one city
block".  He states his chest pain was relieved with rest.
Today the patient describes sudden onset of substernal chest
pain at rest while having a bowel movement around 2 pm.

Per patient report and wife, had an ETT at Dr.Destina Bera office
on Friday that was within normal limits.  Today, his chest
pain was 2006-12-31 00:00:00 consistent with 123 Any St.us angina associated with
nausea, dry heaves, positive shortness of breath, and perfuse
diaphoresis.  The patient called EMS, his wife was not home.
His blood pressure at the time was 168/92 with a pulse of 90.
Patient had missed his am medications.  The patient was given
aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin, albuterol, and his chest
pain decreased to 2006-12-31 00:00:00.  At the outside hospital Emergency
Department, the patient was started on Plavix, Integrilin,
and Heparin, intravenous nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, and
Lopressor.

His electrocardiogram showed anterior ST elevations, and he
was taken to the catheterization laboratory.  At the
catheterization laboratory, he was shown to have a complex
bifurcation stenosis at the left anterior descending
artery/D1.  Balloon angioplasty was performed to the D1 and
left anterior descending artery with residual 30% stenosis in
each.  Patient was chest pain free status post procedure.  He
was then transferred to UPMCE
for further management.

At UPMCE, the patient was
asymptomatic with no chest pain, no shortness of breath, and
his vital signs were stable.

performed for dyspnea on exertion, patent LIMA to the left
circumflex, patent saphenous vein graft to the PDA, 80%
stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery.
The patient had balloon angioplasty, but no stenting of this
lesion as the stent could not be passed.  Cardiac
catheterization on 2006-12-31 00:00:00 performed for continued
dyspnea on exertion.  The patient had PCI of the left main
into the diagonal with atherectomy and stenting of a long
segment of disease from the distal left main to a major high
first diagonal branch and proximal left anterior descending
artery.  The [** Location **]usly treated mid left anterior descending
artery on 2006-12-31 00:00:00 was widely patent.  The patient had PTCA of
ostial left anterior descending artery, pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 7.

the outside hospital to greater than 50 at UPMCE.  Of note, the outside hospital
laboratories were at 4 pm and the UPMCE laboratories were at 8 pm.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS:  When performed by the EMT, the
electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle
branch, left axis deviation, 123 Any St. elevations in the
anterior leads and 2-123 Any St. elevation in the inferior and

72 with a right bundle branch block, ST elevations V1 and V2
with 123 Any St. elevations in II, III, and aVF, V4 through V6
and aVL with 123 Any St. depressions.  At UPMCE, sinus with a normal axis and normal
intervals, no bundle branch block, 1-123 Any St. depressions in
the lateral leads, 123 Any St. depressions in the inferior leads
and borderline left ventricular hypertrophy.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 71-year-old male with
recurrent myocardial infarction secondary to stenosis, plaque
of the left anterior descending artery territory.  The
patient is status post angioplasty to the left anterior
descending artery and D1.  Electrocardiogram changes
resolving.  The patient is chest pain free.  The patient is
transferred to the UPMCE CCU
for closer monitoring, groin hematoma status post
catheterization, history of bleeding.

1. From a cardiac standpoint, the patient was continued on
Integrilin for 18 hours, aspirin, and Plavix.  Heparin was
held secondary to the groin hematoma.  The patient was given
initially metoprolol 5 mg IV x3 for a heart rate normal sinus
in the 90s.  He was then given 75 mg po Lopressor.  He was
started on Captopril 12.5 tid and a nitroglycerin drip to
keep his blood pressure between 110-120 systolic and to
decrease preload and therefore cardiac stress.  His CKs were
continued to be cycled.  Daily electrocardiograms were
checked, and he was continued on his statin.

From a pump standpoint, the patient had an echocardiogram on
the 6th that showed decreased ejection fraction of 35-40%.
Of note, the patient's last ejection fraction was 50% on
2006-12-31 00:00:00 with this echocardiogram showing severe hypokinesis
of the left ventricle, anterior wall, and septum.  From the
rhythm standpoint, patient was continued on Telemetry with
normal sinus rhythm.  He was placed on Lopressor UPMCE.

On Telemetry, he was noted to have NSVT, highest 4.  EP was
consulted as this patient has a known low ejection fraction
and myocardial scarring along with NSVT.  The EP consult,
they performed a signal average electrocardiogram which was
positive by 2006-12-31 00:00:00 criteria with a QRS of greater than 114 and a
LAF of greater than 38.  It was decided that the patient
should follow up after discharge on the 29th at 1:10 pm to
have more formal EP studies.

2. Renal:  History of chronic renal insufficiency with
baseline creatinine of 1.2-1.6.  The patient was given
postcatheterization hydration at 75 cc of normal saline per
hour.  He was also treated with Mucomyst 600 po x2 and his
magnesium was repleted for a magnesium of 1.0, he received 4
grams of magnesium sulfate x1.  His magnesium corrected to
1.5 on 2006-12-31 00:00:00.

3. Neurologic:  The patient was noted to be agitated on
evenings and required Ativan prn and a few doses of 1 mg of
Haldol for agitation.  He however, had no episodes of DT's or
withdrawal seizures.  He was placed on a CWA scale, but never
had a CWA level of greater than 10.

The patient was discharged to home on 2006-12-31 00:00:00.  He had no
further episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath.  He
had worked with Physical Therapy and ambulated well without
decrease in sats and was able to walk stairs without
significant elevation in blood pressure or heart rate.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Imdur 60 q day.
2. Metoprolol 100 qid.
3. Captopril 12.5 tid.
4. Folic acid 3 mg UPMCE.
5. Plavix 75 q day.
6. Atorvastatin 50 q day.
7. Allopurinol 100 q day.
