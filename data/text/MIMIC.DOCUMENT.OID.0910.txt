Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Atenolol / Lisinopril

Attending:Jaquaisha Mangos
Chief Complaint:
Endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2005-10-11 00:00:00 - Redo sternotomy, Aortic valve replacement(21mm St.
Delna Doble Regent Mechanical)/Closure of aortic abscess (Patch
pericardium)/Ascending Aorta Replacement(28mm Gelweave graft).


History of Present Illness:
66M w h/o bicuspid aortic valve, s/p mechanical AVR (on
Delna Doble)
in 2005-10-11 00:00:00 at UPMCE.  The ascending aorta was noted to be 4.5cm at
the time, and was not replaced.  He had an episode of
enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis in 2005-10-11 00:00:00.
Enterococcal endocarditis was again diagnosed in 2005-10-11 00:00:00
with
concern for aortic valve ring abscess on echo.  The patient
was evaluated for the source of his enterococcal bacteremia and
mild ischemic colitis and several polyps were found. A
polypectomy was performed. An EGD found mild gastritis and he
was
started on Pantprazole. The patient was discharged on ampicillin
and gentamicin on 2005-10-11 00:00:00.
He was admitted on 2005-10-11 00:00:00 for preoperative workup and cardiac
cath.  Cardiac cath did not reveal obstructive coronary lesiosn.

On admission, the patient exhibited gait instability and
neurology was consulted.  It was determined that the patient was
experiencing vestibulopathy secondary to gentamycin.  MRI
revealed very small microembolic infarcts which were attributed
to his time off 2005-10-11 00:00:00 resulting in subtherapeutic INR, or,
less likely, septic emboli.  Gentamicin was discontinued and the
patient was discharged home on ampicillin, which will continue
until surgery.  ID has continued to follow him as an outpatient
with weekly blood cultures.  The patient returns for heparin
bridge preoperatively.

Pertinent Results:
2005-10-11 00:00:00 ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is probably present.
An aortic annular abscess is seen. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Post bypass
S/P AVR with 21 Delna Delna Doble mechanical valve prosthesis and graft
placement.
The patient is now on an Epi drip @.04 mcg/kg/min,Nor
epinephrine @.14 mcg/kg/min
The mean gradient across the aortic valve is 16,with a cardiac
index of 2.6
The valve is well seated,with no paravalvular leak.
The ejection fraction is estimated at 35%

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Doble was admitted to the UPMCE on 2005-10-11 00:00:00 for surgical
management of his aortic valve endocarditis. Heparin was started
as a bridge to surgery as he had stopped his 2005-10-11 00:00:00 five days
prior to admission. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. On 2005-10-11 00:00:00, he was taken to the operating room where he
underwent a redo sternotomy, a mechanical aortic valve
replacement, an ascending aorta replacement and closure of an
aortic abscess with patch pericardium. Please see operative note
for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated.

He continued to make steady progress and was discharged to home
on postoperative 2005-10-11 00:00:00 with [**Location (un) 6061**] Infusion for
com123 Any St.n of his IV antibiotics. His 123 Any St. will managed by
Dr. Jaquaisha Mangos as per preoperatively. He will follow-up with Dr.
Jaquaisha Mangos, his cardiologist and his primary care physician and
infectious disease as an outpatient.
