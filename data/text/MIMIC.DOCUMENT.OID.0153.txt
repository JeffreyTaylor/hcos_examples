CXR:
2009-08-12 00:00:00: There is stable cardiomegaly. The lung volumes are
preserved. There is no significant interval change in
predominantly basal and subpleural interstitial abnormalities
consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis. There are no acute
focal consolidations.

2009-08-12 00:00:00: Increased interstitial markings are again demonstrated.
The cardiac silhouette is prominent as before. Mediastinal
structures are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Barrera is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
right-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, COPD,
interstital lung disease, DM 2, and CRI admitted for hypoxia and
a RLE ulcer.

1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Most likely etiology to dyspnea and hypoxia
are fluid overload in setting of severe right sided heart
failure and pulmonary hypertension, as well as increasing
ascites.  The patient was diuresed with lasix gtt and then po
lasix during admission.  In addition, the patient underwent a
therapeutic paracentesis with 4 liters of ascites taken off with
significant improvement in symptoms.  Of note, the patient was
not on spironolactone, which he may benefit from in terms of
managing his ascites.  At discharge, the patient was at baseline
on 4 liters nc supplemental O2, which is his home requirement.
On discharge, he was also instructed to continue his lasix,
albuterol, and home O2.

2. CHF: Patient with significant pulmonary hypertension and
right-sided heart failure on last TTE with preserved EF.  The
patient was continued on lasix during admission.  On discharge,
he was instructed to continue with his lasix regimen.

3. RLE ulcer: On admission, the patient was treated empirically
with vancomycin, which was converted to PO antimicrobial therapy
during admission.  As the patient has a significant allergy to
PCN and sulfa, he was started on a 7 day course of levofloxacin.

4. COPD/Interstitial lung disease: Currently stable. Followed by
Dr. Barrera as outpatient.

5. Upper GIB: Patient with one episode of coffee ground emesis
in the ED. His hematocrit has been stable and he has been guaiac
negative since admission.  Of note, the patient has a prior
episode of coffee ground emesis during his last admission to
UPMCE in 2009-08-12 00:00:00.  At that time, the patient was evaluated by GI
and declined an EGD.  Given the the patient's significant right
heart failure and congestive hepatopathy, he may likely have
varices although this cannot be confirmed without EGD.  He was
initially started on an IV PPI for potential bleeding ulcer,
which was converted to PO PPI on discharge.  The patient had
negative stool guaiacs and his hematocrit remained stable during
admission.

6. Coagulopathy: Patient with INR of 1.5 during admission,
likely secondary to malnutrition and hepatic congestion.
Received 10 mg po vitamin K x2 during admission.

7. Ascites: Patient with SAAG of 1.1 with TP>2.5 suggestive of
congestive hepatopathy. He does have >250 WBC (PMN 21) on
ascitic fluid analysis, although this is in the setting of a
traumatic tap (RBC 2009-08-12 00:00:00).

8. CKD: Creatinine at baseline during admission.

9. OSA: Continued on CPAP at night during admission.

10. Prophylaxis: Patient treated with DVT prophylaxis during
admission.

prescribed.
