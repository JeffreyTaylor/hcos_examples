History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Yeatts is a 64-year-old female with a PMH significant
for Celiac Disease, hemorrhoids, old CVA (2010-03-30 00:00:00), hypertension,
hypothyroidism, and known cecal AVM who was recently admitted to
UPMCE (2010-03-30 00:00:00) with a large GIB 5 days prior to this
admission. At that time her Hct was 19, NGL negative, transfused
several units of blood to bring her Hct up to 35. No colonoscopy
performed given her overall good clinical stability and
discussion about risks/benefit of procedure. Patient was
discharged home yesterday and was doing well until the day of
admission to this hospital, when she had several episodes of
BRBPR, associated with lightheadedness, but no CP/SOB. Also
complained of some lower abdominal cramping discomfort that was,
at worse, 2010-03-30 00:00:00 in severity and felt better after having a bowel
movement. Bleeding occurred in the setting of her bowel
movements. She had been on Aggrenox for an old CVA, but this was
held in the middle of 2010-03-30 00:00:00, several days before her last
admission.
.
Patient has a history of LGIB in 2010-03-30 00:00:00, found to have large AVM
on c-scope that was clipped. No subsequent scopes or bleeding
until now.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: 98.4, 89, 152/71, 18, 96% RA. The Hct
was 36.5. On rectal exam by ED resident, hemorrhoids were noted,
and there was BRB in the vault but no active source seen. GI was
consulted. Three PIVs (two 16g and one 18g)were placed and the
patient was typed and crossed by blood bank for 4 units PRBCs.
.
On arrival in MICU, she had no complaints and appeared fairly
stable. On further ROS at time of admission she denied chest
pains, dyspnea, fevers/chills, nusea, vomiting, diarrhea.

Brief Hospital Course:
INITIAL ADMISSION AND BRIEF MICU COURSE:

The patient was admitted to the MICU in stable condition. GI
advised starting Golytely with plan for colonscopy in the AM on
the day after admission. On the night of admission, however, her
hematocrit dropped to 28 and she was noted to have voluminous
blood from the rectum.  General Surgery and IR were consulted
simultaneously given the volume of bleeding, and it was felt
that waiting for a tagged RBC scan would be unsafe so the
patient was taken emergently to the IR suite. NGL negative. 4
units pRBCs and one unit of platelets were transfsued
immediately via the Level One.  No source of bleeding was
identified on angio. The patient remained HD stable and returned
to the MICU with the sheath in the R femoral artery left in
place in case of rebleeding.  GI performed a colonscopy the next
AM w/o finding obvious source, concern for bleeding from small
bowel. She returned to the IR suite; again no source could be
identified. Within one hour of patient returning to floor,
abdomen became exquisitely tender, pt was already being
transfused upon return then dropped BP.  Pt required 8u pRBCs, 3
FFP, 3 platelets.  A stat CT ABD/PEL revealed a large
retroperitoneal hematoma, and the blood presure transiently
dropped to the 70s. The patient had an epiosde of emesis with
likely aspiration. Vascular and IR were consulted, no
intervention thought to be warranted as patient had stabilized.
A left subclavian cordis line was placed.  In total, the patient
was transfused 13 units PRBCs before her Hct stabilized at 29.
On Hospital Day 3, the patient was feeling better, without
further rectal bleeding. She had a productive cough with
evidence of aspiration on the CXR, sputum with GPCs and GNRs,
and she was started on a course of IV Levaquin/Vancomycin before
transfer to the general medical floor on the evening of 2010-03-30 00:00:00
.
.

ADDITIONAL HOSPITAL COURSE AFTER TRANSFER FROM MICU TO GENERAL
MEDICAL UPMCE:

In summary, Mrs. Yeatts is a 64-year-old female with known
recurrent BRBPR, and recent complication of retroperitoneal
bleed after IR angiography procedure during GI bleed workup, and
new aspiration PNA, who was afebrile with stable hematocrits for
nearly 2 days by the time she was transferred from MICU to
general medical floor on 2010-03-30 00:00:00.
.
# GI Bleed /BRBPR: Prior to this admission Mrs. Yeatts had a
known history of cecal AVM per records, as well as
diverticulosis. She had gross blood noted in ED on rectal exam.
It was thought that her known AVM was the likely source although
it was unable to be definitively located on both colonoscopy and
repeat angiography. Rectal bleeding had subsided by time of
transfer to the medical floor. As above, her second
interventional radiology angiography was complicated after
sheath removal and sudden blood pressure drops, hematocrit drips
and RLQ / right inguinal and flank pains. NGT placed on 2010-03-30 00:00:00 for
aspiration concerns and airway protection after an emesis
episode with coughing. This was due to a confirmed
retroperitoneal bleed. She needed IVFs,pressor support for BP
control, about 13 Units of blood and several bags of platelets
and FFP to stabilize. She had been on Aggrenox for CVA history
but this was held as of 2010-03-30 00:00:00 after presentation to an outside
hospital prior her re-admission only days latter to UPMCE for
recurrent BRBPR. GI team followed patient while she was in
hospital and recommended another follow-up outpatient
colonoscopy in 8 weeks time.  The patient wished to resume her
care with her prior GI physician Yeatts. Yeatts here at UPMCE so
she was asked to set up a follow-up appointment within a few
weeks of discharge.

Left subclavian trauma line placed for about 2 days and then
removed and she also had IV access with 2 large guage PIVs up
until 2010-03-30 00:00:00 and she was switched to one IV. Team kept an active
type and cross. She was kept NPO immediately after the large
blood loss and GI/RP bleeding over 2010-03-30 00:00:00 -2010-03-30 00:00:00 but was then
started back slowly on clears, then she had a video swallow
study that confirmed no major aspiration issues so she was
advanced to a regular PO diet with gluten restrictions in place
for her Celiac Disease. Nutrition consult assisted with helpful
diet recommendations and she tolerated a regular diet very well,
although she limited some of her intake due to her worry that
some of her loose stools from Celiac Disease would worsen. She
was reassured that she was on a gluten free diet and that she
needed to preserve her nutrition as much as possible given her
deconditioned state. She had been placed on UPMCE IV Protonix
during her active bleeding but this was transitioned to an oral
40mg Protonix tablet several days prior to discharge. Admission
Hct was 36.5 and nadir was to 27. If she was not given back
multiple transfusions so rapidly in setting of heavy GI/RP
bleeding her hematocrit would have likely plunged much lower,
much quicker. By time of discharge her Hct was stable for days
at about the 31-34 range.
.
#Retroperitoneal bleed: As above, hematocrits have been stable
and climbing. Abdominal pain at RLQ continues to improve slowly.
Able to sit up in chair and ambulate with a walker. She was
reminded not to lift any heavy objects >10-lbs. or to do any
straining/strenuous activities for 2-3 weeks. PT/OT worked with
patient and she progressed slowly. RP bleed should eventually
fully reabsorb and this was explained to patient. As she was
clinically stable the team felt there was no need to repeat CT
again, and she can discuss timing of repeat imaging, if any, at
her outpatient follow-up with PCP Citori Yeatts/or Dr. Yeatts, her GI
physician here at UPMCE.
.
# Prior CVA: She had a right thalamic capsular stroke with
short-lived resultant left sided ataxic hemiparesis in 2010-03-30 00:00:00. Now
she ambulates well at baseline with slight unsteadiness at times
from her RLQ discomfort but has been given a walker to be used
for better stability. She was taken off of Aggrenox 3/22 per
records and was asked not to restart her Aggrenox or aspirin.
Despite sudden drops in her blood pressure due to hemorrhage in
retroperitoneum while in the ICU, she has no signs of any
lasting mentation deficits. A&Ox3 and no focal deficits on
neurological exam for the entirety of her hospital course.
Physical therapy followed patient during hospitalization and
felt she was stable for discharge back to her UPMCE
facility with some home services and use of a walker for
ambulation while she fully recuperates.
 .
# Hypertension: Blood pressures slightly elevated to 140-160s
systolic ranges for a few days after transfer out of the ICU.
The medical team was purposefully allowing more laxity due to
recent bleeds. She was continued on her usual home Valsartan and
Norvasc was initially held but gradually added back and the dose
was slowly uptitrated to her usual 10mg daily dose, which is the
dose she was discharged on. Blood pressures on day of discharge
were predominantly normotensive in the 118-140/50-70s range.
.
#Aspiration PNA: Per notes and patient reports, Mrs. Yeatts
has a chronic cough at baseline in recent months. Sputum
production and coarse rhonchi with progressive cough occurred
soon after she had an aspiration event. CXR infiltrates all
appeared new from prior comparisons and her cough flared up
within minutes after she had an  aspiration on 2010-03-30 00:00:00. Sputum
production but no hemoptysis. No CP, mild SOB with improving
oxygen requirement now. She weaned quickly from 4L to 2L NC and
is now comfortable on room air with oxygen saturation levels in
the mid-90s. Sputum culture confirmed Streptococcal pneumonia.
She was given 10 days of IV vancomycin and levaquin with
improvement in her breathing and cough. She was also given nasal
saline spray and guaifenisen for more cough suppression.
Shortness of breath and cough markedly improved by time of
discharge and she had no fevers or leukocytosis so she was not
placed on any extended oral antibiotics at discharge. She will
plan to see her PCP on Thursday, 2010-03-30 00:00:00 for close follow-up.
.
# Chronic facial neuralgia: Chronic issue, symptoms for > 1
year. Most painful around forehead area. Continued on Tylenol
and avoided NSAIDs/Motrin due to GI & RP  bleeding.
.
#Right lower extremity swelling: On 2010-03-30 00:00:00 the team noticed that
her right lower extremity was a little more swollen and there
was asymmetry. Given her immobility she was certainly at risk
for DVT. Fortunately, lower extremity ultrasound showed no
evidence of any DVTs. Edema is on same side a her large RP bleed
which may explain the swelling.
.
#Cellulitis left forearm: After her IV was pulled out on 2010-03-30 00:00:00
she had an erythematous 2" diameter circular area over her left
antecubital region with some tenderness, and some purulent fluid
at prior IV site. She was given local bacitraicin ointment and
continued on her usual IV Vancomycin and Levaquin through the
weekend, prior to discharge. On day of discharge the area was
nonedematous, and there was no additional expressible discharge
and erythema had abated so an additional oral antibiotic was not
added.
.
# Hypothyroidism: She was continue on her usual home dose of
Levoxyl therapy daily.
.
# Glaucoma of left eye: She was continued on home eye drop
routine daily with
Cosopt drops to left eye twice daily and she also got her
nightly left eye Latanoprost drops as well. No loss of vision or
report of any visual changes while in the hospital.
.
# Celiac disease: Stable, gluten free regular diet continued.
She had some loose stools which were likely due to her Celiac
condition. However, given her recent hospitalizations and
antibiotics a C.difficile assay was collected and was negative.
If results return positive, team will notify PCP.  Citori Yeatts above, she
was followed by the inpatient nutrition service as well.

.
# Code Status: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient

Discharge Condition:
Stable. Alert and oriented to person, time and place. No
apparent distress.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at UPMCE.
.
You were admitted after having some bloody bowel movements. You
continued to have dropping levels of red blood cells and
required multiple blood transfusions. You had an interventional
radiology procedure to try to find the bleeding source in your
GI tract. After having a sheath placed and then removed from a
major blood vessel in your groin area you had a complication
called a retroperitoneal bleed with some bleeding into your
right lower abdominal region. This eventually stabilized after
additional blood transfusions, IVFs and medications to help keep
your blood pressure from dropping.
.
Shortly after having a colonoscopy you experienced some nausea
and vomiting which may have been from bloating post-colonoscopy
or from increased abdominal pressure from some internal bleeding
you had. This vomiting episode unfortunately involved some
aspiration which is when droplets of digestive contents and
vomit can go down the wrong passage way and end up in the lungs.
This led to a cough, fevers, and a pneumonia that was identified
on chest x-ray.  Therefore, you were placed on antibiotics which
helped you to recover. Later in your hospital course you also
had some redness over your left arm where an IV had been placed.
This was concerning for a local skin infection but improved
within 48 hours. Please continue to cover it with Bacitraicin
ointment topically for 1 week.
.
Please follow-up with all of your appointments as outlined
below. Also, please be sure to have a repeat colonoscopy in
about 8 weeks time.
.
Lastly, please do not lift any heavy objects greater than 10 lbs
for at least 2 weeks time after being discharged. If you
experience any acute worsening abdominal pain, enlargement or
spread of the bruising over your right flank/lower abdomen,
