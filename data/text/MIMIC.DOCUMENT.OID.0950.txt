Chief Complaint:
s/p head-on collision bicyclist vs bicyclist

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
laceration repair right brow


History of Present Illness:
49M transfer from 123 Any St. s/p bicycle accident (head-on
collision with another bicyclist). He was helmeted and there was
a possible LOC, brought to 123 Any St. where patient was initially A
+ O x 3, workup there included CT head showing ICH, right
orbital fracture, overlying laceration concern raising for open
fracture.

At OSH, the pt became somnolent and less responsive after
receiving pain meds (dilaudid 1mg IV), and was intubated
electively for airway protection. He received Td and Ancef 1g IV
at OSH. Reportedly only able to visualize counting fingers w. R
eye at OSH prior to intubation During transport had difficulty
sedating with propofol, titrated up to maximal dosing, switched
to versed and fentanyl on arrival for better sedation. FAST was
negative in the ED.

Pertinent Results:
CXR 2013-06-01 00:00:00: No acute intrathoracic process.

CT Torso 2013-06-01 00:00:00: 1. Slightly anteriorly displaced fracture of the
body of the right scapula. 2. Small amount of free fluid in the
pelvis without evidence of visceral organ, bowel or mesenteric
injury. 3. No pneumothorax.

CT C-spine 2013-06-01 00:00:00: 1. No fracture or malalignment.

CT head 2013-06-01 00:00:00: 1. Interval slight progression of the right
anterior temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage adjacent to a
sphenoid fracture consistent with intracerebral contusion. On
attending overread, this was read as "The anterior temporal
abnormality appears to be an epidural hematoma." 2. Unchanged
and two small foci of right frontal lobe intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Redemonstrated are fractures of all four walls of
the right orbit and all four walls of the right maxillary sinus.


Repeat CT head 2013-06-01 00:00:00: 1. Slight increase in size of small
epidural hematoma overlying the right temporal lobe, now
measuring 7 mm, 123 Any St.usly 5 mm. 2. Small right frontal lobe
contusion, stable. No new intracranial hemorrhage seen. 3.
Multiple facial fractures with associated hemorrhage, stable.

CT sinus/max/face/mandible 2013-06-01 00:00:00: Fractures of the right orbital
superior, lateral, and inferior walls are unchanged with stable
5-mm depression of the inferior orbital wall. The right inferior
rectus muscle is not involved. There is a hemorrhage within the
right frontal sinus with fracture of the posterior wall.
Fracture and slight widening of the frontozygomatic suture is
stable. Small focus of air and hematoma seen adjacent to a
minimally depressed right superior orbital wall fracture,
unchanged. Subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue swelling over
the right face remains stable. The globes are intact. A small
epidural hematoma overlying the right temporal lobe and
contusion of the right frontal lobe is also stable, and better
described on same-day head CT. Communited fractures of the right
aspect of the sphenoid sinus /optic strut region are also seen.

R arm xrays: Three views of the right elbow demonstrate no
evidence of acute fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.
Apparent lucent and slightly expansile lesion in the proximal
shaft of the radius measuring 2 cm in diameter has well-defined
geographic margins favoring a non-aggressive lesion. However, if
symptoms are localized to this region, a bone scan may be
considered for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
 Mr. Wagoner was admitted to the Trauma SICU after being seen by
ophtho in ED where they verified no entrapment (forced duction
intact), an intraocular pressure 22 on R, 10 at L, and a
question of intraretinal hemorrhages. They determined that it
was difficult to rule out traumatic or compressive optic
neuropathy given poor view of optic canal, with a poor view of
optic nerve. He remained intubated and hemodynamically stable
after admission to the ICU. For his head injury, he was placed
on dilantin. His vent was weaned as tolerated over that day. He
became hypotensive with precedex so this was discontinued. Over
his first hospital day, he continued to be quite sensitive to
sedation/pain control. On 2013-06-01 00:00:00, his vent settings were weaned
and he was subsequently extubated. His R frontal laceration was
repaired by plastic surgery and he was noted to have a R facial
nerve paralysis, mostly in the frontotemporal branch as well as
the zygomatic branch. This was thought to be likely from a
contusion of the nerve, but possibly a transection of the more
distal portions of the frontal branch.
 He was transferred to the floor on 2013-06-01 00:00:00. Upon transfer to the
floor, he was reevaluated by Opthamology who did not note any
major acute injury and recommended follow up with his
ophthalmologist for visual field testing given his retinitis
pigmentosa. He will continue on his dilantin for 1 week with
follow up in Neurology in 1 month.
  His vital signs are stable and he is afebrile.  He is
tolerating a liquid diet/soft  but continues to report pain upon
jaw movement. Over the last 24 hours, he has reported new onset
of double vision.  Opthalmology was consulted and he has a
follow up appointment this week.   He was evaluated by OMFS for
jaw mal-occlusion and will follow-up with his dentist.    He has
an appointment  with Plastics in 3 days for removal of sutures.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you struck another
cyclist while riding your bike. You sustained facial injuries.
You were seen by Plastic surgery, and the oral-maxillary
surgeons.  You are now preparing for discharge home with the
following instructions:

SINUS PRECAUTIONS

Because of the close relationship between the upper back teeth
and the sinus, a communication between the sinus and the mouth
sometimes results from surgery. This condition has occurred in
your case, which often heals slowly and with difficulty. Certain
precautions will assist healing and we ask that you faithfully
follow these instructions:

1. Take the prescribed medications as directed.

2. Do not forcefully spit for several days.

3. Do not smoke for several days.

4. Do not use straws for several days.

5. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least 2 weeks, even
though your sinus may feel ??????stuffy?????? or there may be some nasal
drainage.

6. Try not to sneeze; it will cause undesired sinus pressure. If
you must sneeze, keep your mouth open.

7. Eat only soft foods for several days, always trying to chew
on the opposite side of your mouth.

8. Do not rinse vigorously for several days. GENTLE salt water
swishes may be used. Slight bleeding from the nose is not
uncommon for several days after the surgery. Please keep our
office advised of any changes in your condition, especially if
drainage or pain increases. It is important that you keep all
future appointments until this condition has resolved



Followup Instructions:
Follow up with Plastic Surgery to have your sutures removed.
