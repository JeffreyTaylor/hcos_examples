Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ortho123 Any St. surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. ICU Course:
# s/p left hip replacement:  Patient tolerated the procedure
well per Ortho although he did have significant blood loss and
fluid shifts. He had a RIJ placed in the OR the postition of
which was confirmed on presentation to the UPMCE. Post-op Hct
stable at 33.2. He received ancef for 24 hours after the
procedure. Was intubated on admission to unit. He was cautiously
weaned from the vent and from Propofol given his prior history
of difficulty with extubation and altered mental status. Opiods
were avoided in management of the patient's pain. He was given
small fentanyl boluses for pain through the night. He was
extubated in the morning without difficulty. The JP drains
contained serosanginous fluid, and on POD1 the patient was
started on enoxaparin 40mg Sc daily. Pain management was an
issue given the patient's underlying hepatic dysfunction. The
acute pain and the chronic pain services were consulted
regarding a lumbosacral block. It was decided that in place of a
lumbosacral block, the patient's Dilaudid PCA would be increased
to dose to .24/6m and his long-acting oxycontin PO 10 mg Q6H.
The patient was successfully extubated upon leaving the UPMCE.
.
# EtOH Cirrhosis - Blood transfusions and insult of surgery
would contribute to higher likelihood of post-op hepatic
encephalopathy.  Patient does have history of grade 1 varices as
well. Mental status was monitored through UPMCE course and the
patient did not have hepatic encephalopathy on exam. Lactulose
was started after the patient was extubated. His home nadolol
was initially held 2005-06-29 00:00:00 low BP, but this was restarted after
extubation.
.
# Pancytopenia - History of thrombocytopenia 2005-06-29 00:00:00 cirrhosis as
well as pancytopenia, (which on 123 Any St.us workup by Heme/Onc was
felt to medication, portal sequestration).  Macrocytic anemia
consistent with history of alcohol and cirrhosis. CBC was
monitored with a goal of keeping platelets > 10 or 50 if acute
bleeding. Through his course in the UPMCE, the patient had an
active type and screen. No transfusions were required
post-operatively in the UPMCE.
.
# Crohn's disease - Stable, not having diarrhea. Continued with
azathioprine when taking POs.
.
# HTN - Initially held lisinopril for now pending fluid shifts
and post op hypotension.
.
# COPD - Documented h/o COPD in OMR but on no home medications.

# Ascending aortic aneurysm: Stable on recent Echo. VS were
monitored.
.
# Depression: Home duloxitine was continued.

2. Asymptomatic post-operative anemia - POD 2 Hct 21.1 ->
Transfused 2 units PRBCs

3. Medicine consult for co-management

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#2.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is TOUCHDOWN weight bearing
on the operative extremity with POSTERIOR and TROCHANTER OFF
precautions.

Mr. Fross is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
