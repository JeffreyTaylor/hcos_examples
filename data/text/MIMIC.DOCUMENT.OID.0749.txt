CXR (2005-07-25 00:00:00):
The patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass
grafting.
Borderline cardiomegaly stable.  Lungs clear.  No pulmonary
edema or pleural effusion.
.
Echo (2005-07-25 00:00:00):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal.  There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (estimated LV ejection fraction ?40%).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and
inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. No definite thrombus seen
(cannot definitively exclude). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2005-07-25 00:00:00, left ventricular systolic function is
now significantly impaired.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABG and PTCA, who
presented with ACS s/p cath, transferred to CCU for medical
managment.  His hospital course for this admission is as
follows:
.
1 Ischemia: ACS likely from inferolateral MI from vein graft
occlusion to OM or to RCA, s/p cardiac cath, no interventions,
currently pain-free.  We stopped intergrillin and heparin since
no acute thrombosis found s/p cath.  We continued ASA 325',
plavix 75', and lipitor 80' initially, and plavix was
discontinued on 2005-07-25 00:00:00 given the pt didn't have any stents
placed.  We started low dose bblock and ACEI initially with
metoprolol 12.5mg'' and lisinopril 5mg', and titrated up to
25mg'' and 10mg', respectively, as BP and HR tolerated.  He was
discharged home on toprol XL 50mg PO qday.  Echo on 2005-07-25 00:00:00
showed  moderately depressed LV systolic function (estimated LV
ejection fraction ~40%), with resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis,  We followed his Hct closely and with goal
to keep Hct >30.  Given patient became hypotensive on NTG, we
avoided NTG and symptomatically control pain with MSO4 (pt
didn't have much pain s/p cath and didn't take any pain meds in
the hospital, and pain free since day 2 of his hospital stay).
.
2 Pump: echo on 2005-07-25 00:00:00 s/p cath showed estimated LVEF
approximately 40% with resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis.  He was continued on ACEI and bblocks.
.
3 Rhythm: continued monitor on tele; remained NSR
.
4 HTN: We started low dose bblock and ACEI initially with
metoprolol 12.5mg'' and lisinopril 5mg', and titrated up as BP
and HR tolerated to 25mg'' and 10mg', respectively. He was
discharged home on lisinopril 10mg PO qday and toprol XL 50mg PO
qday.
.
5 Hyperlipidemia: checked lipid panels which showed total
cholesterol 115, TG 106, HDL 43, LDL 51; and continued lipitor
80mg'.
.
6 Prophylaxis: SC heparin (discontinued once patient started
ambulating), bowel regimen, Getsemany Abendano
.
7 FEN: cardiac diet
