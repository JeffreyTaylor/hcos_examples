Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Patient has been consistently febrile, initially started on
vancomycin and zosyn for presumed pneumonia, sputum cultures and

blood cultures positive for yeast. She was treated with
meropenam, vancomycin, flagyl, and then on 2007-09-19 00:00:00 caspofungin
added. She continues to be febrile. Since 2007-09-19 00:00:00 blood cultures
have been negative, sputum continues to grow yeast.

GI: On 2007-09-19 00:00:00 she was noted to have rise in her LFT's and
abdominal
tenderness, she was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy
and found to have an ischemic colonic perforation. R colectomy
and ileostomy placement was performed at that time. She is still

not receiving feeds through the G tube.

Heme: Initially anemic, now hct has been stable in mid-20's.

Neuro: Pt when admitted on 2007-09-19 00:00:00 was noted to follow commands and

express pain. She was on her home regimen of paxil for anxiety.
On day of admission she was started on propofol for agitation,
it
caused hypotension and it was weaned. She was at that time noted

to be sedated but still following commands. On 2007-09-19 00:00:00 she was
switched to a versed drip. On 2007-09-19 00:00:00 she was unarousable, versed
stopped and only given morphine PRN. She was noted on 2007-09-19 00:00:00 to
follow commands and "awake and alert." 2007-09-19 00:00:00 went to the OR, and
afterwards was treated with propofol and fentanyl. On 2007-09-19 00:00:00 she
was noted to have minial movement of her LUE and none of her
RUE,
but moved both lower extremities in response to pain. On 2007-09-19 00:00:00
she
was reported to be "following commands" and responding to
painful
stimuli. She has been on a fentanyl drip until 2007-09-19 00:00:00, when she
was
switched to a fentanyl patch. On 2007-09-19 00:00:00 fentanyl patch was d/c'ed
and she has only been receiving fentanyl prn dressing changes.
Today, it was noted that despite being off sedation for several
days, she has not been awake or following commands initially
However this status has continues to improve and patient had
remained afebrile on trach trial up to 5 hours, she will need
continued wound care to incision with wet to dry dressing
