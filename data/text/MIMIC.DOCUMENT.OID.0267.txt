Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, lip and tongue swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84yo w/PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (hemi123 Any St. in 2012-04-09 00:00:00),
diastolic heart failure, HLD, PVD refered from UPMCE rehab
after bolus fluids for Roudebush given poor PO intake and elevated Cr
on labs (felt to be pre-renal) and lasix held yesterday. However
after fluids bolus of 1L, pt became hypoxic to 85% w/crackles. K
elevated to 5.5 at UPMCE rehab, got kayexalete. She was then
given 60mg lasix w/out much improvement despite diuresis at
which point transferred to UPMCE. Pt has had gradual decline in
MS (somnolent, but no confusion). Also developed large tongue
and protruding lower lip concerning for angioedema in setting of
chronic ACEI use. However, per report swelling developed slowly
since her recent ED admission on 2012-04-09 00:00:00 during which she was
started on augmentin. Other than this she has had no medications
but has been on enalapril for extended period (duration
unknown).

Of note, pt was hospitalized ~1 mo ago for PVD, failed LLL
angioplasty and stent intervention for ischemia which failed and
amputation under consideration for chronic non healing ulcer. Pt
has been on oxycodone for pain which has resulted in sedation
and consequently poor PO intake. Pt now has Cr of 3.3 (baseline
2.0) on labs. Also had bought of cellulitis for which she
presented to ED on 2012-04-09 00:00:00 which was treated w/augmentin and
cellulitis improved.

In ED, arousable, follows comands, VS 98.4 74 139/59 20 97% 4L,
now on 2L 96%. Diffuse crackles throught; no lower extremity
edema,benign ab exam. Replaced foley with stable inguinal
hematoma (firm indurated, no erythematous or warm there for 2012-04-09 00:00:00
days). Elected not to image given ok VS and no abnormalities on
exam, hemotoma has been stable. On CXR pt had retro-cardiac
opacity, given recent outbreak of RSV at nursing home, pt was
given Vanc/Cipro (HCAP).

On the floor, appears in NAD however does have swelling of the
lower lip, Roudebush and eyes. Has difficulty pronouncing words
given lip and tongue swelling. Denies pain but does say that her
foot bothers her. States that her breathing is fine, no chest
pain, no abdominal pain

CXR 2012-04-09 00:00:00:
There is severe cardiomegaly associated also with bilateral
hilar enlargement, findings that might be consistent with
complex valvular problems as well as cardiomyopathy. There are
most likely present bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
evidence of pulmonary edema. Calcified right pleural plaques are
redemonstrated. There is no evidence of pneumothorax

TTE 2012-04-09 00:00:00:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Mild
functional mitral stenosis from annular calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo w/PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (hemi123 Any St. in 2012-04-09 00:00:00),
diastolic heart failure, HLD, PVD refered from UPMCE rehab for
hypoxia after receiving IVF, along with tongue and lip swelling
for the last few days concerning for angioedema.

ANGIOEDEMA: the patient was seen by the allergy consult team
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2562**] Kiairra Skovron) who thought this was consistent with angioedema,
she was started on dexamethasone 4mg q8hrs and H2 blockers.  her
symptoms improved and she was sent to the regular medical wards
from the ICU.  Her steroids were tapered to 2mg po q8hrs on 2012-04-09 00:00:00
and stopped completely on 2012-04-09 00:00:00.

PULMONARY EDEMA: She improved with blood pressure control.  Her
home lasix of 40mg po daily was restarted on 2012-04-09 00:00:00 as she had
some rales at the R base of her lung and mild shortness of
breath.  Her O2 sat was 95% on room air.  Her creatinine had
improved.  In addition for BENIGN HYPERTENSION her ACEi had been
stopped as noted above and she was started on hydralazine 25mg
po q6hrs, her nifedipine was increased to 60mg po bid (from 40mg
po bid) and her imdur was increased from 30mg po daily to 60mg
po daily.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: urine electrolytes consistent
with a pre-renal cause but given recent angiogram this also
could be related to contrast nephropathy.  Her renal failure
improved with time and blood pressure control.  Her creatinine
at discharge was 2.3 (baseline 2-2.2).  Chem 7 should be checked
in the next 5-7 days to ensure stability.

TOE ULCERATION, PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: non infected toe
ulceration.  She had a recent angiogram and will f/u with
podiatry and vascular surgery (appointments have been made)

URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Started on PO cipro on 2012-04-09 00:00:00. She has
completed a 5 day total course.

POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURE: on 2012-04-09 00:00:00, this was treated with
vancomycin until it returned as 1/2 bottles from one set of coag
negative staph.  At this point she did not have a PICC or mid
line or any other foreign body.  She was afebrile and had no
white blood cell elevation, her vancomycin was last dosed on
2012-04-09 00:00:00 (1 gram IV), this was likely a contaminant so
antibiotics were discontinued.

DIABETES TYPE II: the patient was on pioglitazone as an
outpatient, given pulmonary edema this was stopped.  While inpt
on steroids she was treated with an insulin sliding scale, on
discharge she was switched to glipizide xl 2.5mg po daily, this
can be further adjusted as an outpatient.

For her history of CVA with chronic left sided hemiparesis and
depression as well as iron and B12 deficiency anemia, the
patient continued on her home med regimen.
