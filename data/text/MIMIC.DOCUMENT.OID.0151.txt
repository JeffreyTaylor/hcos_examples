Attending:Lanelda Koelmel
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 yo M with h/o CHF c/o dyspnea and 23lb wt.
gain in last 10 days.  The patient was discharged from UPMCE 10
days ago.  He has been followed closely by VNA and his
cardiolgoist.  His lasix doses have been progressively increased
but his weight has been going up and he has been having
worsening SOB.  Denies CP, SOB, fevers, chills.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 94 125/69 24 83%4L. O2 sat's
improved to the high 90's on NRB. BNP >3000. He received a total
of lasix 80mg IV x 1 and had 1900cc urine output.
.
In the MICU, the patient was started on Bumex IV 2mg prn dosing
for goal I/O of 1-2L negative daily with good effect. He was
restarted on spironolactone as well and has continued to diurese
with improvement in his symptoms. His verapamil was transiently
stopped on 2007-11-25 00:00:00, and patient subsequently developed atrial
tachycardia, thought to be MAT,(which it was not)and was started
on a dilt drip and digoxin loaded. Dilt was transitioned to PO
verapamil, and he has been continued on the dig. HR appears to
be well controlled at this time. Additionally, he developed
increased erythema of his left lower extremity at the site of
his prior cellulitis, and blood cultures from that day grew coag
neg staph 2 out of 2. He was initially started on Vanc IV and
this was changed to tetracycline as a result of the patient's
allergies. He is currently on day 3 of 7.
.
The patient reports he is feeling much better, though not quite
to baseline. His SOB is much improved and he feels his ascites
is reduced. He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, headache,
chest pain, diarrhea, dysuria, melena or hematochezia. He does
report abdominal distention which is improved. Has 2 pillow
orthopnea at baseline and denies PND 2007-11-25 00:00:00 using BiPAP at night.
Additionally, denies stroke, TIA, DVT, PE, joint pains,
hemoptysis or exertional buttock or calf pain. He does report a
chronic dry cough which is at his baseline.

Physical Exam:
Vitals - T 97.3 BP 100/55 HR 83 R 20 92% on 4L NC
General - well appearing male, sitting up in chair in NAD
HEENT - NCAT, PERRL, oropharynx clear, dry MM
Neck - supple, JVP elevated to angle of jaw (though has 4+ TR)
CV - distant heart sounds, RRR, faint 2007-11-25 00:00:00 murmur at

posteriorly on left, 1/2 up on right
Abdomen - distended, nontender, soft, + BS
Ext - b/l venous statsis changes/PVD, 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally, well-healed scar over left shin at site of prior
cellulitis, no open areas
.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
2007-11-25 00:00:00 CXR - No significant change with persistent
cardiomegaly and likely bibasilar effusions/atelectasis. No
overt CHF.
2007-11-25 00:00:00 KUB - Gas distended stomach. No evidence of
obstruction.
2007-11-25 00:00:00 Ct Abdomen - Slight interval increase in small right
pleural effusion and intra-abdominal ascites. Otherwise, stable
CT appearance of the abdomen and pelvis.
2007-11-25 00:00:00 Port abd - No dilated air-filled loops of bowel to
suggest obstruction
2007-11-25 00:00:00 CXR - A single portable view of the chest is compared
to prior examination dated 2007-11-25 00:00:00. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is enlarged, but stable. Current examination reveals
increasing patchy opacities at the bases bilaterally, right
slightly greater than left. Also, blunting of the right
costophrenic angle is noted, suggesting pleural effusion.
Probable underlying copd.
2007-11-25 00:00:00 CXR - Cardiomegaly and residual CHF with small
effusions. Interval improvement compared with one day earlier.
.
EKG 2007-11-25 00:00:00: Rhythm is sinus tachycardia with atrial premature
complexes. There is borderline low voltage in both the limb
leads and precordial leads. There is an RSR' pattern in lead V1
as well as right axis deviation. There are diffuse ST-T wave
changes. Overall configuration suggests pulmonary disease. When
compared with prior tracing of 2007-11-25 00:00:00 the rate has increased,
though it is quite similar to tracing of 2007-11-25 00:00:00.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CHF, acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction - Patient admitted
with SOB likely 2007-11-25 00:00:00 to CHF exacerbation, has severe diastolic
dysfunction with pulmonary hypertension and severe TR.
Difficulty balancing diuresis and renal function as an
outpatient. He was initially started on Bumex IV with signficant
diuresis.  He was then transitioned to PO Lasix and has
continued to diurese on this regimen.  Appears to maintain even
Is/Os on Lasix 80mg PO BID. He will be discharged on this
regimen with follow up to determine the most appropriate
long-term regimen for him.  His baseline oxygen requirement is
4L NC satting 88-92%. Additionally, he uses BiPAP overnight.  He
is satting low-mid 90s on 3L NC at the time of discharge. He was
continued on his Metoprolol at 12.5 UPMCE, Spironolactone was
added at 25mg PO daily.  He was also discharged on Verapamil.
His weight was 207.6 pounds on discharge.
.
# Atrial tachycardia: Some concern that patient was having MAT
while in the MICU, however, unable to find evidence of MAT in
patient's ECG. He appears to be in an atrial tachycardia.
Verapamil was increased to 180mg daily, and he was continued on
Metoprolol 12.5mg UPMCE.  He was rate controlled with HR in the
80s on this regimen.
.
# COPD/Interstitial Lung Disease: Recent admission in early
2007-11-25 00:00:00, patient had workup for worsening ILD. Echo readings of
severe pulmonary hypertension (not new), worsening dilated RV,
and worsening TR found. Patient had a trial of sildenafil
however, it was stopped secondary to side effects of
hypotension, tachycardia, and dizziness. No plan for further
sildenafil.  He was started on prn inhalers and continued on his
home oxygen regimen. He will require continued outpatient
pulmonary follow-up.
.
# ID/Cellulitis: During his recent hospital admission (dc'd
2007-11-25 00:00:00), patient completed a 7 day course of clindamycin for L
shin cellulitis. During his stay in the MICU, patient developed
by report increasing erythema of his L shin and spiked a fever.
He was initially started on vancomycin for positive blood
cultures. These subsequently grew GPC/coag neg staph. No further
positive blood cultures. He was transitioned to tetracycline for
his cellulitis. He received 4 days.  His antibiotics were
discontinued as he did not appear to have further evidence of
cellulitis, remained afebrile and had no leukocytosis. Baseline
erythema of PVD remained unchanged for the duration of his
admission.
.
# CAD: Clean coronaries on cath in 2007-11-25 00:00:00.  Continued on
Metoprolol, Verapamil, Atorvastatin.
.
# Anemia: Baseline appears to be around 35. Range of 32-39
during admission with no evidence of bleed. Last iron studies in
2007-11-25 00:00:00 showing iron 53, TIBC 368, Ferritin 40, TRF 283. Likely
secondary to chronic kidney disease.
.
# Hypothyroid: Pt complaining of cold intolerance. TSH found to
be 11. Free T4 1.1. Likely subclinical hypothyroidism.  Started
low dose thyroid supplementation on discharge. Patient should
follow with PCP.
.
# Coagulopathy: INR elevated at 1.4 since 2007-11-25 00:00:00. Unclear
etiology. AST wnl, ALT slightly elevated at 45. 2007-11-25 00:00:00 be
nutritional though albumin is 3.6. Can be monitored as an
outpatient.
.
# DM: On oral medications at home. On ISS during admission.
Restarted on home regimen on discharge.
.
# CKD: Baseline creatinine is 1.6-1.7. Slight increase in
creatinine to 1.9 during admission, likely a result of
aggressive diuresis. Stable over several days.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a worsening of your heart failure.  A
significant amount of fluid was removed, and you are now back to
your baseline weight with improvement of your breathing.

It is very important that you take your Lasix (furosemide) as
directed. This should keep the fluid from re-accumulating.  In
