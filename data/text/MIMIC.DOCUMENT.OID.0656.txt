History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old male with a history of hypertension, type
II DM, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, and
polysubstance abuse who presents from an OSH s/p cardiac cath
for further management of his coronary disease. Per report from
UPMCE, Mr. Bobbitt was admitted on 2009-10-20 00:00:00 with
epigastric discomfort that subsequently developed into chest
pain radiating to the jaw and left shoulder. Per the patient, he
has been having intermittent abdominal pain associated with
nausea and vomitting for approximately 2.5 weeks to 1 month. The
abdominal pain is in the epigastrium, not associated with eating
or with position and is non-radiating. The abdominal pain has
resolved since being in the hospital.
.
On the evening of 2009-10-20 00:00:00, he reports that his abdominal pain,
was accompanied by 8 out of 10 substernal chest pain. The chest
pain radiated to his jaw and left shoulder. This pain lasted for
approximately 1 hour and resolved in the ED at UPMCE. He
does not recall 123 Any St.itating factors for this chest pain. But
does report that his roommate informed him that he had "passed
out" for an unknown period of time on this same evening. The
patient does not recall this event.
.
At UPMCE, he was found to have a Utox positive
for cocaine and benzos. From review of records, his cardiac
markers were negative x 1, and it is unknown whether there were
any EKG changes. Per report, he was advised to undergo a cardiac
cath, but the patient was initially reluctant, until today, the
patient finally became agreeable to the procedure. On cardiac
cath at UPMCE, he was found to have 95% RCA, 90% LAD, and
90% LCx disease. He was transferred to UPMCE for further
management of his coronary disease, originally for plans for
PCI.
.
On arrival to the UPMCE cath holding area, he reported having
5/10 chest pain. He was given SL NTG x 2, lopressor IV 5 mg x 1,
and NTG gtt. He became hypotensive to SBP 60s and was given IVF
NS 400cc which brought up his blood pressure to SBP 130s. He was
restarted on NTG gtt for persistent chest pain. No EKG findings
noted at the time. Per evaluation by Dr. Aixa Catasus, he was
transferred to the CCU with plans for CABG. He currently denies
chest pain. He does report that he has 2009-10-20 00:00:00 diffuse HA that
started earlier today since being started on the nitro gtt.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  2009-10-20 00:00:00 8:20 AM
Two views. Comparison with 2009-10-20 00:00:00. A slight interval change in
streaky density of the left base consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. No pleural fluid is identified. The right lung
remains clear. The patient is status post median sternotomy and
CABG as before. There is a homogenous density in the
retrosternal space consistent with postsurgical change. The bony
thorax is grossly intact.
