HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old
female with end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes.
She also has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular
disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with chest pain.

The patient felt chest pressure while walking and had
associated shortness of breath and emesis.  She did have
relief with rest.  On admission, she did also note that her
blood sugars were running higher than normal.  She did have a
stress test five years ago as a possibility for transplant
option which was normal.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was given aspirin,
ceftriaxone, Lopressor, and was chest pain free.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Her past medical history includes)
1.  Type 1 diabetes with associated retinopathy and
neuropathy.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  End-stage renal disease (hemodialysis dependent).  Her
hemodialysis schedule is on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
5.  History of hypothyroidism.
6.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of the bilateral lower extremities.
7.  Status post amputation of her right foot.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient moved here from 123 Any St. and
lives with her mother in Chris Ek.  She does not smoke.  She
does not drink alcohol.  She does not use intravenous drugs.
She does ambulate with a cane.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to CLINDAMYCIN (which
gives her diarrhea), LEVAQUIN (which gives her
gastrointestinal upset), and ZEMPLAR (which gives her a
rash).

1.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  NPH insulin 26 units subcutaneously in the morning with

subcutaneously of regular and 4 units subcutaneously of NPH.
4.  Tums by mouth three times per day.
5.  Epogen 13,000 units with each dialysis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient's review of systems was
positive for diarrhea for four days.  No hematochezia.  No
orthopnea.  Positive for chest pain (as in History of Present
Illness).  Positive for a dry cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's physical
examination revealed she was a pleasant female in no apparent
distress; although she did look malnourished.  The patient's
vital signs revealed her temperature was 98.5 degrees
Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 79, her blood pressure was
133/68, her respiratory rate was 16, and her oxygen
saturation was 94% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed multiple large cystic lesions on
her face and under her chin that were confluent.  There was
no warmth, but there was positive pigmentation.  The
patient's pupils were equal and reactive.  The oropharynx was
clear.  Her chest examination revealed the lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  There was a 2/6 systolic
murmur at the right upper sternal border.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive bowel
sounds.  Extremity examination revealed no edema.  Her right
foot had a partial amputation.  Her left foot had a dorsalis
pedis pulse of 1+.  She had good capillary refill on the
right.  Neurologic examination revealed her cranial nerves
were intact.  Her strength was grossly intact and symmetric.
She did have decreased sensation in her lower extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
laboratories on admission revealed her white blood cell count
was 17.5, her hematocrit was 38.9%, and her platelet count
was 344,000.  The patient's sodium was 138, potassium was
3.8, chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 32, blood urea nitrogen
was 23, creatinine was 6.3, and her blood glucose was 46.
Her troponin was 0.3 and CK/MB was 2.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient's chest x-ray
showed cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution.  No
effusions or consolidations.

The patient's electrocardiogram revealed 1-mm ST depressions
in V4 through V6 and there were T wave inversions in leads I,
V3, and V4 and minor changes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
and eventually was sent for cardiac catheterization.  The
cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 35%
and 3-vessel disease (including 100% occlusion of the right,
80% left anterior descending artery, and 100% posterior
descending artery).

The patient was then referred to Dr. Janic Volney for
coronary artery bypass grafting.  While awaiting surgery, the
patient's Plavix was held and had no complications.

On 2007-11-18 00:00:00 the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
the distal left anterior descending artery, and a saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery.

The surgery was performed by Dr. Janic Volney with Dr.
Ek and Chris Ek (PA-C) as assistants.  The
surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia
with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 91 minutes and a
cross-clamp time of 64 minutes.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
with two atrial and two ventricular pacing wires with one
left pleural chest tube and dobutamine, Levophed, and
propofol drips.  The patient was in a normal sinus rhythm.

Over the postoperative night, the patient was extubated
without complications.  She remained on her dobutamine drip,
and the Levophed drip was weaned as tolerated.

By postoperative day one, the patient was to have
hemodialysis and her Plavix restarted.  Following dialysis,
her chest tubes were discontinued without incident.  The
patient's dobutamine was weaned off over this day.  By
postoperative day two, the patient was started back on her
beta blocker.

Throughout the early postoperative period (over the first two
days postoperatively), the patient was on an insulin drip for
tighter control of her blood sugars.  On postoperative day
five, the patient was finally off of her insulin drip and her
blood sugars were maintained with NPH and sliding-scale.  The
patient continued during that time to receive regular
hemodialysis at the bedside.

On postoperative day six, the patient was transferred to the
regular floor and was continued on vancomycin and gentamicin;
especially for the lesions on her face.

By postoperative day seven, the patient was switched to by
mouth medications for the pustule lesions on her face; this
medication was Keflex.  She had her pacing wires discontinued
without incident on this day, and the plan was for her to be
discharged to rehabilitation the following day.

On postoperative day eight, the patient was doing well.  She
did receive an additional course of hemodialysis on this day.
It was felt that she was ready and stable to be discharged to
rehabilitation for further continuation and recovery from her
cardiac surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's discharge
examination revealed her vital signs to be stable with a
temperature of 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was
96, her blood pressure was 140/67, her respiratory rate was
20, and her oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.  In
general, the patient was alert and oriented times three.  In
no apparent distress.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  Her wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  The
patient's legs revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Her
wounds were clean, dry, and intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's
laboratories on discharge revealed her white blood cell count
was 15,000.  Her hematocrit was 29.3%, and her platelet count
was 370,000.  The patient's sodium was 132, potassium was
4.9, chloride was 94, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen
was 40, creatinine was 7, and her blood glucose was 113.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING ON DISCHARGE:  A chest x-ray
showed very small bilateral pleural effusions, but no signs
of infiltrate.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was to be discharged to
rehabilitation today (2007-11-18 00:00:00).
