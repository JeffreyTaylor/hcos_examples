History of Present Illness:
Briefly, pt is a 78 year old male admitted from a UPMCE with
persistent leukocytosis and a febrile epsiode. Pthad WBC of 30
on 2012-03-06 00:00:00 and was started on levaquin for presumed urinary tract
infection, although his urine culture was polymicrobial in
nature. His WBC had trended down to 8, but yesterday he had a
fever to 100.7 and his WBC increased to 12.1.  Pt is largely
non-verbal and was unable to participate in the interview.

Of particular note, pt was 123 Any St.usly admitted in
2012-03-06 00:00:00/2012-03-06 00:00:00 after he sustained a fall complicated by
C1/C2 fractures and bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages, now
s/p G-tube placement. This hospitalization was also complicated
by bradycardia to the 30s, with baseline HRs in the 50s in
atrial fibrillation. Donepezil was held due to AV nodal effects
and TTE was unremarkable with a normal EF >55%. Cardiology was
consulted and considered pacemaker placement at the time.

In the ED, initial VS: 98.8 72 110/74 20 96% 2L. He was given
acetaminophen and IVFs. Repeat labs showed a leukocytosis to
13.8 without a bandemia and a mild transaminitis. RUQ U/S showed
2cm non-obstructing gallstone without gallbladder wall edema or
pericholecystic fluid (CBD not visualized). CXR was without
consolidation concerning for PNA. U/A showed significant blood,
but only 14 WBCs and small leuk esterase with no bacteria (on
levofloxacin). Vitals on transfer were: Temp: 98.7, Pulse: 80,
RR: 18, BP: 118/84, O2Sat: 97, O2Flow: RA.

On the floor, he is non-verbal and is difficult to assess any
pain or discomfort.

The patient developed increasing secretions on the floor
complicated by cardiopulmonary arrest. He was intubated and
resuscitated with return of spontaneous circulation after two
rounds of chest compressions. He was transfered to the ICU, then
made CMO and transfered to the floor after extubation.

Past Medical History:
-atrial fibrillation with bradycardia; being considered for
pacemaker placement
-Parkinson's disease c/b dementia
-BPH with urinary retention, indwelling foley in place from UPMCE

-HTN
-hyperlipidemia

nasal bone fx, and b/l intraparenchymal hemorrhage (2012-03-06 00:00:00
2012-03-06 00:00:00)
-s/p G-tube placement

Social History:
Lives in 123 Any St.usly lived with
wife in the community. No tobacco or EtOH use per records. Per
nursing at Kalep Cielo pt is able to occasionally answer yes/no
questions, although not appropriately.

Family History:
unable to obtain

                            **FINAL REPORT 2012-03-06 00:00:00**
   URINE CULTURE (Final 2012-03-06 00:00:00):    NO GROWTH

CXR 2012-03-06 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral views of the chest are
obtained. The lungs appear clear without focal consolidation,
effusion, or pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable with unfolded
thoracic aorta again noted. Bony structures appear intact. There
is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION: No signs of pneumonia

CT Head w/out contrast 2012-03-06 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolution of the 123 Any St.usly noted frontal contusions.
2. Focal area of increased attenuation in the left temporal
region,
extra-axial in location, which may relate to the adjacent part
of the left transverse sinus or small subdural hemorrhage.
Consider close followup to assess stability and to exclude
hemorrhage in this location. Study limited due to motion-related
artifacts.

RUQ US 2012-03-06 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation of the liver and gallbladder due to
difficulty with
patient positioning and interference with existing feeding tube.

2. Distended gallbladder with a 2.0 cm gallstone. No
pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening seen. The
patient could not be evaluated for sonKalep Cielo Kalep Cielo sign.
Aside for gallbladder distention, no definite secondary signs of
acute cholecystitis, but exam is suboptimal. HIDA scan could be
considered for further evaluation.

EEG 2012-03-06 00:00:00
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because
of continuous spike and wave and polyspike and wave discharges,
ranging
from 2012-03-06 00:00:00 Hz, some of which correlate with myoclonic jerk of the
body on
video. These findings are consistent with myoclonic seizures,
and in
the setting of post-anoxia, portend a very poor prognosis. Over
the
course of recording, generalized epileptiform discharges
persisted
without clear improvement.

MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST 2012-03-06 00:00:00
1. No acute infarct.
2. Generalized cerebral volume loss with changes of chronic
small vessel
ischemic disease.
3. Numerous microhemorrhages in bilateral cerebral hemispheres,
which likely represent changes of amyloid angiopathy.
4. Chronic- appearing odontoid fracture of undetermined age.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Cielo is a 79y/o gentleman with Parkinson's dementia s/p
recent fall with intraparenchymal hemorrhage and C1/C2 fractures
who presented with persistent leukocytosis and isolated fever,
likely due to urinary tract infection.  He had a PEA arrest, was
intubated, and was transferred to the MICU.  Neurology was
consulted for myoclonic movements and EEG confirmed that these
were likely myoclonic seizures in the setting of anoxic brain
injury, with a dismal prognosis.  Family meetings were held, and
the decision was made to make the patient CMO.  He was extubated
on 2012-03-06 00:00:00 and expired on 2012-03-06 00:00:00.
