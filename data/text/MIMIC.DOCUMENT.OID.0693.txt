LE weakness and feeling unwell where he was found to be in ARF
complicated by hyperkalemia.  States that he started to feel
unwell a few days ago.  Has been suffering with frequent loose

Brief Hospital Course:
53yo male with CAD, DM, CHF, and chronic renal insufficiency
transferred from the MICU after being initially admitted for
acute renal failure with hyperkalemia both of which are now
improved.
.
PLAN:
1. Acute Renal Failure:
Patient was initially admitted with hyperkalemia secondary to
acute renal failure with creatinine elevated to 2.8 from
baseline of 2007-11-26 00:00:00.2 thought most likely secondary to increased
ACEI dose in the setting of hypovolemia from diarrhea and
continued diuretics.  Creatinine has improved to 1.9 from 2.8 on
admission with roughly 700cc positive for LOS.  Pt. did not
receive dialysis during stay. Continued lisinopril at 1/2 dose
for now.  Holding lasix and spironolactone.  Patient will
follow-up with PCP within the next 1-2 days after 2007-11-26 00:00:00 to
decide whether to restart lasix and spironolactone.  Renally
dosed medications.  Continued telemetry.  Renal followed patient
during hospitalization.  Followed Creatinine and urine output.
.
2. CHF:
Patient with known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20% and
followed by Dr. Cullum in cardiology.  Continue to hold lasix
(home dose is lasix 160mg PO daily) until renal function and BP
stabilize, will need to be restarted as outpatient.  Continue
low-dose ACEI with lisinopril at 5mg (1/2 dose), beta blocker
with low-dose carvedilol 3.125mg PO daily.  Continued daily
weights and low sodium diet.  Patient has outpatient follow-up
for consideration of ICD placement with Dr. Eilzabeth Zigmund on 2007-11-26 00:00:00.

.
3. Tachypnea:   Upon admission, patient with tachypnea, though
most likely a compensatory response 2007-11-26 00:00:00 metabolic acidosis from
renal failure. Now improved with improving renal function.
.
4. Asymptomatic Hyponatremia:  Na 118 upon admission thought
most likely secondary to ARF and volume de123 Any St.n and diuretics
use.  Has been improving steadily since admission with Na 135 on
day of 2007-11-26 00:00:00.
.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: No evidence of active ischemia.
Continued beta-blocker, high dose statin, ASA.  Gave 1/2 dose
ACEI given ARF.
.
6. Diabetes Mellitus:  Continued patient's home insulin regimen
of lantus 72 units at bedtime with insulin sliding scale.
Monitored finger sticks.
.
7. Depression: continued home dose of prozac.
.
# FEN:  Diabetic, heart-healthy, low Na, renal diet.  Continued
MVI, iron daily, folate 1mg daily.
.
# Proph: Continued H2 blocker, anticoagulated on coumadin.
Maintained contact precautions.  Ariee Cullum bowel regimen given recent
diarrhea.
