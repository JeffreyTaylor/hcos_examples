MRI head:
1. Enhancing mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with mass
effect as described above, most consistent with a metastatic
lesion. No additional mass/abnormal enhancement.
2. Old lacune in the left caudate nucleus and a nonspecific T2
hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe, likely post-traumatic
or chronic small vessel ischemic change.
3. Mucosal changes in the right sphenoid sinus.

CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal metastatic disease.
2. A 9-mm hypoattenuating liver lesion is likely a cyst but
should be
monitored closely on followup exams.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis.
4. Large paraesophageal hernia.
5. Stable pericardial lymph node.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Nausea and vomiting:  Concerning presentation for brain
metastasis. Tarceva d/c'd on thursday of last week w/continued
N/V as well as unsteadiness of gait

# NSCLC: further treatment plans per Dr. Lyden and Emaley Loggie
