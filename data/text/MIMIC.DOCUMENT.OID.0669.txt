Abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
47 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer
and two prior episodes of pancreatitis thought to be secondary
to hypertriglyceridemia who presents with abdominal pain. The
patient was in her usual state of health until this morning when
she began to feel epigastric abdominal pain, associated with
nausea and vomiting. Does not report hematemesis or diarrhea.
She denies recent fever, chills, head ache, chest pain, back
pain, sob, cough.

Patient had a similar episode one month ago and one in 2012-02-07 00:00:00. She
denies history of EtOH use and had CCY in 2012-02-07 00:00:00 with no
subsequent history of gallstones. She is on a new course of
chemo (Navelbine and Neuslasta).

onc hx:
Primary Onc: Dr. Khaylie Dahilig
Metastatic Breast ca- in past, undewent chemo w/
adriamycin/cytoxan, then taxol. Then, she received
5FU/leukovorin and Zometa. Her course has been complicated by
compression fractures in T1-T6 and T9.  She underwent radiation
treatment for T1 and developed more pain and T6 then was found
to have a compression fracture with cord compression. She was
hospitalized while she started radiation treatment. The decision
had initially been made to continue her chemotherapy through her
radiation treatment as a radiation sensitizer; however, the
patient had episodes of severe nausea and vomiting and diarrhea
resulting in additional  hospitalizations. She is finishing off
her radiation treatments with the omission of 5-FU leucovorin.
She was restarted weekly taxol on 2012-02-07 00:00:00 until 2012-02-07 00:00:00.  Pt was
switched to gemzar since 2012-02-07 00:00:00 due to apparent progression of
disease. CT on 2012-02-07 00:00:00 showed progression in size of liver mets and
development of new right sided pulmonary nodules. PET 2012-02-07 00:00:00
showed widespread metastatic bone lesions which were stable in
intensity and number.

Social History:
Lives with her husband and 3 children in 123 Any St.. She works as
a radiology tech as UPMCE. She denies any EtOH use, drug
use or smoking.


Family History:
Aunt with breast cancer on father's side. Mother with bladder
cancer. Uncle with unknown type of cancer.

Imaging:
CXR (2012-02-07 00:00:00): Lungs are clear without infiltrate, effusion,
or pneumothorax.
Abdominal CT (2012-02-07 00:00:00): Marked peripancreatic inflammatory
change, with free fluid in the retroperitoneum, and extending
into the pelvis. Findings compatible with known history of
pancreatitis. No loculated fluid collection, pancreatic
necrosis, or vascular complications identified. Stable hepatic
and osseous metastases.
MRCP (2012-02-07 00:00:00): Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right, extensive peripancreatic inflammatory change without
evidence of
pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation. Normal appearance
of the biliary tree and pancreatic duct, stable appearance of
multiple hepatic metastases, diffuse fatty infiltration of
liver.
2012-02-07 00:00:00
Rib Film (2012-02-07 00:00:00): No definite lytic or sclerotic rib or
shoulder metastases identified. Bone scan is recommended for
further evaluation due to its greater sensitivity for detection
for metastases. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
Bone scan: (2012-02-07 00:00:00)
Numerous metastatic bone lesions as described above which are
stable
compared to the most recent prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 female with metastatic breast cancer and two prior episodes
of pancreatitis (98 and 2012-02-07 00:00:00) thought to be to be secondary to
hypertriglyceridemia admitted for acute pancreatitis most likely
secondary to hypertriglyceridemia v. chemotherapy.

1) Pancreatitis:
In the ED (2012-02-07 00:00:00) the patient reported diffuse abdominal
pain, nausea and vomiting. Her amylase (825), lipase (2113) and
WBC (32.2) were all elevated. Abdominal CT showed marked
peripancreatic inflammatory change, with free fluid in the
retroperitoneum, and extending into the pelvis. No loculated
fluid collection, pancreatic necrosis, or vascular complications
were identified. The radiological findings, lab values and
patient's presentation was compatible with pancreatitis, and she
was subsequently admitted to medicine for acute pancreatitis
believed secondary to hypertriglyceridemia v. chemotherapy. She
was given morphine for pain, put on bowel rest with continued
agressive IV hydration. The evening after admission, the patient
had MS changes, became tachycardic to 150's, required increased
IVF and had rectal temp to 103.8. She was subsequently
transferred to the MICU for closer observation. In the MICU, she
reported LUQ pain which was initally attributed to pancreatitis
(See discussion below). MRCP showed extensive peripancreatic
inflammatory change without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
pseudocyst formation. The pancreatic duct and biliary tree
appeared normal. Metastases were unchanged from prior studies.
Patient's WBC, amylase and lipase continued to trend downwards,
but she continued to have intermittant fevers (see discussion
below). She was transferred to UPMCE for continued management. A
PICC line was placed for TPN and later removed (see discussion
below). At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile and
WBC, amylase and lipase were wnl and she was on only PO pain
meds. She was able to tolerate soft solids.

2) LUQ/left lower rib pain:
Thiswas most likely secondary to pleural irritation due to
pancreatitis. Rib films and bone scan swere negative for
fractures or rib mestases that could be contributing to her
pain, CTA was negative for PE, and, although CT scan showed
small bilateral pleural effusion, their low volume prevented
thoracentesis. The patient was initially started on a dilaudid
PCA Dilaudid, from which she was transitioned to Oxycontin,
hydromorphone, and gabapentin. At time of discharge, her pain
was adequately controlled.
.
3)Bacteremia:
Blood cultures from 2012-02-07 00:00:00 (resulted 2012-02-07 00:00:00) grew two
morphologies of coag (-) staph (1/4 bottles). These were
believed to be a contaminant, but given the patient remained
febrile, she was begun on vancomycin (2012-02-07 00:00:00) pending subsequent
blood cultures. On 2012-02-07 00:00:00 a PICC line was placed for TPN
delivery (see discussion below). BCx from 2012-02-07 00:00:00 (resulted
2012-02-07 00:00:00) also grew coag (-) staph. Upon receiving these results
on 2012-02-07 00:00:00, BCx were drawn from the PICC and then the PICC was
removed (the tip grew coag negative staph). Those blood cultures
resulted on 2012-02-07 00:00:00 and grew gram + rods (coryneobacterium;
likely a contaminant). TTE was performed and was (-) for
mass/vegetation (limited study). Given concern for the
possibility of portacath infection, blood cultures were drawn
from the portocath, which were negative at time of discharge.
The infectious disease service was consulted, who recommended
that she complete a 10 day course of vancomycin (to complete
2012-02-07 00:00:00) to treat presumed PICC line infection. She will have
repeat blood cultures drawn after com123 Any St.g this her antibiotic
course.

4)Fever:
The patient was febrile for the first week and a half of her
hospital stay, which was most likely secondary to resolving
pancreatitis, with possible contributor of coagulase negative
staph bacteremia (see above). She underwent a thorough
infectious disease work-up which, aside from the bacteremia
noted above, was negative. At time of discharge, the patient has
been afebrile for >72 hours.

5) Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 37.4 to 24.8,
which was attributed primarily to hemodilution. There were no
schistocytes on smear and no clinical evidence of bleeding. She
received 4 units of blood, and her hematocrit has since remained
stable in the low 30's. Prior iron studies were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease. On this admission, folate and vitamin
B12 were found to be nl/high.

6) Hypertriglyceridemia: The patient has a longstanding history
of hypertriglyceridemia and two prior bouts of pancreatitis
thought to be secondary to hypertriglyceridemia. The patient
will restart her Tricor upon discharge home.

7) Metastatic breast cancer:
Prior to admission, patient was a chemotherapeutic regimen of
neulasta and navelbine (two weeks on/ one weeks off). Oncologist
(Dr. Khaylie Dahilig) is concerned that one or both of these agents
may have 123 Any St.itated the two most recent bouts of pancreatitis.
Patient will follow up with Dr. Khaylie Dahilig to discuss potential
treatment alternatives.

8) FEN
Following diagnosis of pancreatitis, the patient was kept on
bowel rest with aggressive hydration. On HD 8, a PICC line was
placed and the patient was begun on TPN on HD 9 to augment her
nutritional status, which was discontinued on 2012-02-07 00:00:00 after removal
of her PICC line. At time of discharge, she was able to tolerate
soft POs and hydrate herself without difficulty
