Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the UPMCE on 2013-05-10 00:00:00. He was kept
intubated and sedeated overnight. He was extubated without
complications on 2013-05-10 00:00:00. His LFT trended down. When he was
extubated we confirmed with patient that he took liquid nyquil
and ibuprofen. We restarted his Paxil at 40 mg per day.

Psychiatry saw the patient and felt appropriate for in patient
psychiatry evaluation. Pt does not want admission but Stricker
criteria for involuntary admission. Social work was consulted
for coping and for help with Mass Health and free care. He was
refused by Mass Health so application accepted for Free Care at
UPMCE so he can get his Paxil paid for.

On day of discharge, pt complained of sore throat and myalgias.
His temp was normal and WBC count slightly elevated. His WBC is
likely related to stress response and sore throat is likely
related to intubation. He was felt to be medically cleared for
psychiatric hospitalization.
