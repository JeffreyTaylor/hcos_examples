.
Admission CXR: no acute process. Right IJ line with tip in the
SVC/RA junction.
.
CT Abd/pelvis:
1. Mild fascial thickening posterior to the transplant kidney.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
2. Incompletely visualized coronary artery calcifications.

.
Renal transplant U/S:
A transplant kidney is seen in the right lower quadrant and
measures 13.2 cm. There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric
fluid collection. Resistive indices in the upper, mid, and lower
poles are 0.64, 0.72, and 0.69 espectively. The main renal
artery and main renal vein are patent with normal waveforms. A
Foley catheter is in the decompressed bladder. IMPRESSION:
Normal renal transplant ultrasound.

degree av block. No acute ST changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 y.o. M with h/o ESRD s/p deceased donor kidney transplant in
2014-05-12 00:00:00 on chronic immunosuppression presents with emesis,
diarrhea, hypotension and acute on chronic renal failure.
.
1. Hypotension: Was likely due to volume loss from diarrhea and
vomiting. Elevated WBC with left shift. Etiology most likely
viral given lack of fever, abdominal pain.  He was continued on
IVF with bicarbonate. He received Hydrocortisone 50mg Q8h for
one day, then was placed back on his outpatient dose of oral
prednisone. Pt initially received antibiotics in the ED, none
were necessary anymore after that since his BP remained stable
and he also remained afebrile. He was discharged with stable BP
but off his antihypertensives. He should schedule a followup
appointment with Dr. Gilberta Sebastiao within one week after discharge.
At this time, it can be decided if he should continue any of his
antihypertensives.
.
2. Diarrhea: Probably infectious, most likely viral, however
atypical bacterial presentation was initially considered. Also
in this immunosuppressed pt need to consider
crytpo/micropsiridia and CMV. CMV was negative in the past. No
recent antibiotic exposure and presentation not suggestive of C
diff. Extensive stool studies were sent but pending upon
discharge. His diet was advanced and his diarrhea resolved
slowly after admission.
.
3. Non Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Probably secondary to
diarrhea, possible component of RTA in the context of worsening
RF, however, the patient has had normal bicarbonate in the past.
He received IVF with HCO3 and his HCO3 came back up to normal
levels.
.
4. Syncopal Episodes: Unlikely to be cardiac/seizure/stroke,
probably due to orthostatic hypotension secondary to
hypovolemia. CT head was negative. Patient was without focal
neurological signs. He was monitored on telemetry for 24 h.
Hypocalcemia was repleted with IV calcium gluconate as needed.
.
5. ESRD s/p DDRT 10 years ago on neoral and imuran and
prednisone. Renal US was wnl w/o signs of rejection. He was
continued on neoral, imuran and prednisone (except for one day
while being on stress dose steroids instead of his PO
prednisone).
.
6. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: likely secondary to
hypovolemia, quickly improved with IVF. Back to baseline (around
2.0) on 2014-05-12 00:00:00.
.
7. Hypocalcemia: no QT prolongation. Probably secondary to
diarrhea. Repleted with IV calcium gluconate.
.
8. Hypertension: Initially hypotensive. Resolved after IVF. Then
remained normotensive. All antihypertensives were held given
hypotension. They should be restarted as an outpatient.
.
9. Prophylaxis: Tolerating POs, pantoprazole while on steroids,
ISSC while on steroids, SQ heparin
.
10. Access: RIJ was placed on 2014-05-12 00:00:00, then pulled the next
day. PIV.
.
11. Code: FULL
