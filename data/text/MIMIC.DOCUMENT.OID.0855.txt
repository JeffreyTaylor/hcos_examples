Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Avery Padrutt
Chief Complaint:
Menometrorrhagia, pelvic pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Abdominal Supracervical hysterectomy
2. Exploratory laparotomy and hematoma evacuation
3. Cystoscopy & retrograde ureterogram


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 29-year-old G5 P1-1-3-2 thin African-American
female with a large symptomatic fibroid uterus, complaining of
prolonged menometrorrhagia as well as severe pelvic pain, who
presented with severe anemia with a hematocrit of 25.

The patient was being evaluated by her PCP for suspected
underlying thalassemia. Iron studies revealed severe
iron-deficiency anemia, however the patient was not compliant
with p.o. iron. Given the source of anemia was likely due to her
fibroid uterus, the patient was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells 1 day preoperatively, as well as 125 mg of Ferrlecit
IV to try to
improve her iron stores and blood supply. The patient was
offered to delay the surgery to improve her iron stores with
p.o. iron, however the patient had been noncompliant and
declined this option. The risks of infection with blood
transfusion, as well as the side effects of blood transfusion,
were discussed with the patient at length. The patient was
counseled extensively and she opted for the preop transfusion
and IV iron, and to proceed with the surgery.  Even after the
patient was transfused the 2units of packed red blood cells, her
post-transfusion heamtocrit was only 27 since she continued to
bleed heavily from her uterine fibroids since the last HCT of
25.

Past Medical History:
PMH: She states that she is otherwise healthy with
the exception of this left lower extremity swelling episode,
which was not painful, unclear etiology.  She is currently not
being evaluated as she was not compliant with followup with her
PCP after the emergency room visit.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  D&C x2 for elective termination of pregnancies.
2.  Her IUFD at 6 months was successfully delivered vaginally
with an induction of labor.


Social History:
Admits to smoking 3 cigarettes per day for the last 2 years.
Also, admits to drinking occasionally 3 drinks per week on
Fridays.  Denies any recreational drug use or IV drug use.  She
is currently employed as an administrative assistant at UPMCE at
the Radiation Oncology Department. She is single, not
currently dating, lives with her mother.  Denies a history of
sexual abuse and domestic violence.

Family History:
Mother, maternal aunt, and maternal niece with history of breast
cancer.  She has a sister who is alive and well without breast
cancer. Denies a family history of ovarian, uterine, cervical,
or vaginal cancer, or colon cancer or any
other cancers in the family.  Also, denies family history of
diabetes, heart disease, or hypercholesterolemia.  Paternal

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for routine post operative care after a
supracervical hyst.  On post-operative day 1, the patient was
noted to have a 3cm non-tender subcutaneous hematoma of the
right superior margin of the surgical wound.  There was
tenderness on the right inferior margin of the wound without
errythema or induration.

On post operative day 2, the pt complained of new onset LLQ
pain.  On exam, the subcutaneous hematoma was stable, but the
inferior wound margin had developed dark red ecchymoses.  There
was tenderness at the left pole of the wound tracking
superolaterally to include the left lower quadrant and left
flank.  There was underlying emphysema to auscultation and
crepitus with palpation.

CT was ordered confirming subcutaneous emphysema at the left
pole of the wound tracking superolaterally as described above.
Additionally, there was emphysema involving the fascia on the
right, beneath the hematoma.  The pt was started on antibiotics
and taken to the OR for wound exploration. The hematocrit
remained stable throughout.  Approximately 400 cc of clot was
found. There was no odor or purulence. The fascia itself
appeared to be viable. The rectus muscles were viable and
responded to electrocautery.  There was no evidence of ongoing
bleeding. Inspection of the abdomen revealed no evidence of
intra-abdominal injury or bowel injury. The small bowel was run
throughout its entirety. The colon appeared intact. The sigmoid
appeared intact. The resection base from the uterus had no
bleeding.  No signs of necrotizing fasciitis was identified.
The abdomen was irrigated.  Post-operatively, patient was
admitted to SICU for close monitoring, and was transferred to
floor without incidence on POD 2007-10-20 00:00:00.  Her abdominal exam was
followed serially over the course of her hospital stay and
dressings were continued to be changed daily wet to dry.

On post-operative day 2007-10-20 00:00:00, patient's creatinine reached height
of 1.6 [0.6 (11.17)-> 1.0 (11.18)-> 1.6 (11.19)] with Fena
0.34%.  ATN secondary to a combination of contrast + NSAIDs +
dehydration was suspected per renal consult.  However, there was
no significant blood loss in the initial Abd SCH nor the
re-operation to suggest a pre-renal causes of the ATN.  The pt's
urine output remained good throughout her hospitalization.  CT
urogram 2007-10-20 00:00:00 showed no hydronephrosis bilaterally; normal R
ureter, no extravasation; but in L ureter, dye did not pass past
superior portion of ureter, no extravasation; no ureteral
pulsation seen in 9 min during study.

On post-op day 2007-10-20 00:00:00, per urology consult, retrograde cystoscopy
was performed and showed no evidence of obstruction or
extravasation bilaterally.  Moreover, her Cr trended down to
1.3.  She was discharged same day in good condition; afebrile,
vital signs stable, tolerating po, and ambulant.  Pt will have
VNA to follow and do wound dressing changes daily.

Pt was advised to return to clinic on 2007-10-20 00:00:00 to have her
creatinine redrawn and evaluated, as well as a wound check.
