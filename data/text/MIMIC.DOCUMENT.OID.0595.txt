Service:  Fishel


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers, chills, abdominal pain in the right
upper quadrant, worsening shortness of breath x1 day,
pleuritic like chest pain and nausea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
male with a history of polycystic kidney disease, status post
cadaveric renal transplant in 2008-04-20 00:00:00, on Rapamune, prednisone
and Gengraf. The patient has a history of polycystic liver
disease with recent cyst infections treated with IV
antibiotics recently, presents with 2 week history of fevers
up to 101, chills, malaise and shortness of breath with
increasing abdominal distention and right upper quadrant
pain. The patient saw Dr. Aoibheann Auwaerter in the clinic the week
prior and was instructed to go to the hospital for further
evaluation. The patient felt worse, however, and came to the
emergency department for evaluation and workup. The patient
complained of malaise and shortness of breath but denied
chest pain. He denied any anorexia or urinary symptoms or new
bowel changes. He did complain of nausea and some dry heaves.
The patient has a history of polycystic kidney disease with
also polycystic liver disease with multiple large liver
cysts, one of which became infected secondarily with a
pansensitive pseudomonas following episode of ERCP induced
cholangitis and bacteremia in 2008-04-20 00:00:00. At that time,
he was initially treated with PIP/TAZO, followed by
recurrence of fevers and persistence of the abscess. He was
drained in 2008-04-20 00:00:00, and treated with 6 weeks of Cipro
plus 2 weeks of Augmentin for an unidentified gram positive
cocci through late 2008-04-20 00:00:00. He did well through 2008-04-20 00:00:00,
when he had recurrent low fevers and malaise. Repeat MRI
showed enlargement of the left lateral liver abscess that was
impinging on the diaphragm and pericardium. He was started on
oral Cipro as an outpatient. He continued to have low grade
fevers.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Polycystic kidney disease,
hypertension, GERD, endstage renal disease, status post
cadaveric renal transplant in 2008-04-20 00:00:00, CHF, biliary stones,
diverticulosis, chronic pancreatitis, cholestasis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cadaveric renal transplant in 2008-04-20 00:00:00,
biliary stenting and an AV fistula.

MEDICATIONS:  At home, prednisone 5 mg, Lopressor 75 mg p.o.
b.i.d., cyclosporin 25 mg b.i.d., doxazosin, Rapamune 1 mg
p.o. daily, Protonix, allopurinol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lasix 20
mg p.o. daily, and Bactrim single strength daily.

The patient was admitted to the transplant service. Full labs
were sent off. A KUB and chest x-ray were done that
demonstrated massive cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent. These were
subsequently negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 99.7,
heart rate 89, blood pressure 133/68, respiratory rate 24, O2
saturation 96% in room air. He was mildly uncomfortable,
appeared uncomfortable. No scleral icterus. EOMI. Respiratory
rate regular. Lungs were decreased on the left base with end
expiratory crackles at base. He was tachypneic especially
when supine. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, but
distant sounds. Abdomen moderately distended, tender over
right upper quadrant. He was tympanitic, no rebound, no
guarding. Extremities: Warm, no clubbing, cyanosis, 1+ edema,
no calf tenderness. GU: Enlarged prostate, normal rectal
tone, guaiac positive. Neurologically, he was 2008-04-20 00:00:00 for
strength throughout. Cranial nerves II through XII grossly
intact. Alert and oriented.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was started on IV Zosyn and vancomycin
renally dosed with IV hydration and cardiology was consulted.
After a right subclavian catheter was inserted, chest x-ray
confirmed placement. The patient was transferred to the SICU,
surgical intensive care unit. Cardiology was consulted for
cardiac tamponade. He was found to have purulent pericarditis
with pseudomonas, likely from translocation of bacteria from
the abscess in the pericardium. A pericardiocentesis was done
and he was drained for approximately 2-3 liters of fluid and
culture was positive for pansensitive pseudomonas and second
gram negative organism was not identified. He was started on
IV vancomycin and Zosyn on admission. Cipro was also added
for double coverage while the sensitivities of the
pseudomonas and the ID of the gram negative rods were
pending. The patient went to the operating room for a
pericardial window and resection of the liver abscess on
2008-04-20 00:00:00. Surgeon was Dr. Aoibheann Auwaerter, assisted by resident
Baileyann Fishel, as well as Dr. Baileyann Aoibheann Auwaerter. The patient
underwent left lateral segmental resection of the liver
including the offending cyst which was found to be densely
adherent to the undersurface of the diaphragm with frank
perforation through the parietal pericardium. Please see
operative report for further details. The patient was
transferred to the surgical intensive care unit
postoperatively with chest tubes, intubated. He remained in
the surgical intensive care unit for a prolonged period of
time during which time he received CVVHD for fluid overload.
He also experienced atrial fibrillation and required an
amiodarone drip. He was converted to a sinus rhythm and
started on digoxin. He had an abdominal J-P and was draining
large amounts of serosanguineous fluids as high as 1.5 liter
per day. This was sent off for culture and was negative.
Thoracic followed the patient for most of this hospital
course. Repeat chest x-rays demonstrated no pneumothorax. His
chest tubes were removed on 2008-04-20 00:00:00, and 2008-04-20 00:00:00. Repeat
chest x-ray demonstrated right basilar atelectasis and left
effusion.

He was gradually weaned from CVVHD and intermittent
hemodialysis was initiated although he experienced some drops
in his blood pressure. Nephrology followed the patient
throughout this hospital course. During this time, he was
maintained on his regularly scheduled prednisone dose. He
experienced a rise in his creatinine from a baseline of 2.2
up to a high of 4. Gengraf was held as well as Rapamune in
the immediate postoperative period to prevent over
immunosuppression. Gengraf was resumed at 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
and Rapamune was eventually resumed at 1 mg per day. This was
adjusted to 0.5 mg per day for a level of 14.4. Rapamune was
later diminished to 0.5 mg once a day.

He was eventually weaned from the ventilator and was stable
on nasal cannula O2. His O2 saturations were satisfactory. He
was eventually transferred out of the surgical intensive care
unit where he was then sent down to the medical surgical unit
where he had a prolonged stay for postoperative pancreatitis.
His amylase and lipase increased to a high of 652 for amylase
and lipase of 1403 around postoperative day 17. His liver
function tests increased during this hospital course.
Pancreatitis etiology was unclear. A MRCP was done. This was
negative and an endoscopic ultrasound was done that showed no
evidence of sludge or stones. During this time, the patient
was NPO and was maintained on IV TPN. He remained on this.
His diet was gradually advanced. He experienced a rise in his
Amylase and Lipase. His diet was downgraded to low fat. It
was felt that possibly the TPN was worsening his liver
function. He was switched to postpyloric feeding tube and
enteral feedings were started. Nutrition was consulted and he
was initially maintained on half strength Nepro. During this
time, he experienced bouts of diarrhea and some abdominal
discomfort. Multiple stools were sent off for culture and C.
Diff. All of these were subsequently found to be negative.
His liver enzymes continued to remain elevated with an AST of
268, ALT of 112, alkaline phosphatase of 788, total bilirubin
of 0.7, albumin of 2.2, his amylase and lipase trended down.
His 123 Any St.-123 Any St. was sent off and was negative for Aoibheann Auwaerter. The
123 Any St.-123 Any St. was eventually removed and the site was sutured
without further incident.

Zosyn was continued for a total of 39 days. Vancomycin had
been stopped 123 Any St.usly given finalization of cultures which
revealed pseudomonas pansensitive. Vancomycin was also
stopped at the time the patient was found to be VRE positive
by rectal swab. He was MRSA negative. All stool cultures were
finalized and negative. Abdominal CT on 2008-04-20 00:00:00,
demonstrated no evidence of pancreatitis, multiple low
attenuation lesions of the liver, many of which represented
cysts, but could not exclude abscesses without IV contrast.
Polycystic kidneys were noted and unchanged. A pericardial
and pleural effusion with subcutaneous stranding with free
fluid was found to be consistent with anasarca. New air
pockets were noted with surrounding soft tissue density
anterior to the bladder. This was felt to be due to recent
catheterization. A liver ultrasound demonstrated no
gallstones, no gallbladder wall thickening.

The patient remained in sinus rhythm and TTE demonstrated a
moderate loculated pericardial effusion and no tamponade on
2008-04-20 00:00:00. He also underwent a retroperitoneal
ultrasound that demonstrated no evidence of biliary
dilatation. The pancreas was poorly visualized on that exam.
A portable KUB demonstrated feeding tube terminating in the
distal duodenum without any bowel obstruction. Also during
this hospital course, he had a renal transplant duplex that
demonstrated patent renal vasculature with no hydronephrosis
or perinephric fluid collection. His creatinine gradually
decreased to a low of 2.5. Throughout this time on the
medical surgical unit, he was afebrile. His blood pressure
remained stable. He continued to be fluid overloaded.
Hemodialysis was stopped. He was treated with IV torsemide
with mild response. His weight continued to remain around
84.3 kilograms. He demonstrated some upper extremity edema.
He did have a known right subclavian thrombus. His left arm
appeared edematous and it was noted that he had a left IJ
central line in place. On 2008-04-20 00:00:00, he underwent an ultrasound
of the left upper extremity that demonstrated no left upper
limb deep venous thrombosis.

In summary, the patient is a 69-year-old male with
complicated hospital course, status post pericardiocentesis
and left segmentectomy, complicated by postoperative
pancreatitis and renal insufficiency. His nutritional status
was of concern. He remained in hospital pending a
rehabilitation bed for enteral nutrition. Physical therapy
followed the patient and felt the patient would benefit from
continuation of physical therapy to increase endurance and
strength. He was ambulating in the hallway with supervision.
His lungs were diminished on the left lower lobe and
bibasilar crackles. Heart rate was regular. Abdomen was soft,
positive bowel sounds, abdominal incision had a small open
area with a 2 x 2 normal saline dressing that was changed
daily and that wound was healing. Old J-P site was clean and
dry as well as the old chest tube sites were well healed. He
continued with 3+ bilateral edema in his legs to his knees.
Labs: White count 7.5, hematocrit 27.9. His hematocrit was
relatively stable. Platelet count 214,000. Sodium 136,
potassium 3.5, chloride 97, CO2 of 25, BUN 65, creatinine
2.5, glucose 109. His glucoses were in the of 109 to 168.

The plan is to send the patient to rehabilitation for
continuation of postpyloric feeding tube feedings using
Peptamen full strength with banana flakes being cycled from
6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. with a goal rate of 100 cc per hour.
The patient was maintained on IV heparin until Coumadin
reached a therapeutic goal range of between 2 and 3. Heparin
was stopped. INRs were therapeutic at 2.6 to 2.7.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. p.r.n. q.4-6
hours, albuterol 1-2 puffs MDI p.r.n. q.6 hours, Atrovent 1-2
