Attending:Aasim Rorvik
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Sigmoidoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 42yo male with history of CAD s/p stents x 3
admitted with acute GI bleed.
.
Patient reports being in his normal state of health until this
evening when he developed sudden onset of BRBPR. It occurred
around 9pm. He was taken to the ED by his parents where he
continued to have lower GI bleed. He has never had a GI bleed
before. Pt denied abd pain and n/v, no hematemesis,
coffee-ground emesis or melena. Patient states he has on and off
suprapubic pain for the past year and that he has frequent
constipation with straining and painn with bowel movements.
Of note, he is on aspirin and plavix for coronary stent
placement.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T- 98.0, HR- 118, BP- 184/157, RR-
18, SaO2- 98% on RA. Patient was initially given 250cc NS but
had persistent tachycardia and developed lightheadedness. He was
then give 3U PRBC and 2L NS with resolution of the tachycardia.
He never became hypotensive or had a fever. Abdominal exam was
benign. Rectal exam showed bright red [**First Name3 (LF) **]. NG lavage was
negative. EKG was unchanged from prior. Hct on admission to ED-
45.8 (with normal coags). Patient lost about 1L of [**First Name3 (LF) **] from GI
tract.
.
GI was consulted and recommended angiogram with embolization as
they were concerned for diverticulosis vs AVM. General surgery
was also made aware of the patient and are available if needed.
IR-team notified and will be coming in tonight to perform
embolization if needed.
.
On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable. Vitals on
transfer: BP- 126/87, HR- 88, SaO2- 98% on RA, RR- 12, and
afebrile. Patient lost another 100cc of [**First Name3 (LF) **] on arrival to the
floor but remained hemodynamically stable. He denied any
nausea/vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness,
lightheadedness. He did report some lower abdominal tenderness
to palpation (L>R) but was not in any distress and did not
demonstrate any signs of acute abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
42M with CAD s/p stent (most recent 2012-07-12 00:00:00 in 2012-07-12 00:00:00) on clopidogrel
and ASA, CHF w/EF=40-45%, h/o of MRSA leg abscess, and
diet-controlled diabetes (A1C 6.2%) who presented with severe GI
bleed 2012-07-12 00:00:00 diverticulosis of sigmoid colon.  The patient was
given 4 units of pRBC's and stabilized in the ICU, and was
discharged in stable condition, with no active bleeding back on
his ASA and plavix, and tolerating regular diet and having
small, formed, dark brown to black stools.  He was also treated
with antibiotics for cellulitis in his left arm due to an insect
bite. Course summarized by problem below:

# GI bleed secondary to diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon:
Followed by surery and GI. Tagged red 2012-07-12 00:00:00 cell scan revealed
2012-07-12 00:00:00 in rectal area. GI performed sigmoidoscopy and found
diverticuli with 2012-07-12 00:00:00 clots explaining source of the bleed.
Admitted to ICU for careful observation in setting of acute GI
bleed with significant 2012-07-12 00:00:00 loss. He received 4u of pRBC's, and
did not require further transfusions after leaving the ICU. He
remained hemodynamically stable throughout his course, with Hcts
in the 43-45 range, and was tolerating a regular diet prior to
discharge. On the day of discharge he was having small, formed,
dark brown to black stools, with no further bright red 2012-07-12 00:00:00.
His aspirin and Plavix were initially held in the setting of his
acute bleed, but were re-started during this hospitalization and
he had no BRBPR, Hct remained stable. He did have dark BMs
during his hospital stay, consistent with old 2012-07-12 00:00:00.  The
importance of a high-fiber, high-vegetable content diet with
ample hydration was emphasized to the patient and his family.
Also, it was emphasized to patient that he MUST NOT stop the ASA
or plavix and take both of these medications daily and not stop
these without talking to his cardiologist. The patient was
scheduled for outpatient follow-up with GI for full colonoscopy.

# Coronary artery disease: patient has history of MI s/Aasim Rorvik Hirsh
123 Any St.es) **] in RCA on 11/2012-07-12 00:00:00. While inpatient, his ASA and plavix
were held during acute GI bleed. His aspirin was carefully
restarted (ASA desensitization done in ICU) and plavix restarted
after patient stabilized.  Given the recent placement of a [**Year (4 digits) **]
in 2012-07-12 00:00:00, as well as his allergy to aspirin and need for
desensitization, the importance of strict adherence to this
daily regimen was emphasized with both the patient and the
family. His home metoprolol was also re-started during
admission, after initial stabilization.

# Acute renal failure: Cr was slightly elevated at 1.3 on
admission, likely secondary to GI losses and pre-renal state. Cr
returned to 123 Any St. during hospitalization. Cr on discharge was
1.1.

# Left arm lesion and cellulitis: Patient reported a "horse fly
bite" and was started on Bactrim (1DS UPMCE)for cellulitis one day
prior to admission. While inpatient he was given 3 doses (1.5
days) of Vancomycin and then restarted on Doxycycline for a
total of 5 days antibiotic treatment, which he finished during
his hospital stay.  The cellulitis subsided, and the patient
remained afebrile throughout. The patient did report 2 year
history of myalgias in bilateral calves and shoulders which may
suggest possible tick bite and underlying lyme disease. Lyme
serologies were pending at time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Hirsh,

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.  You were
admitted to the hospital for bleeding from your intestines.  You
were diagnosed with diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
Diverticulosis is a condition in which there are small
outpouchings in the wall of the intestine; in your case, these
small outpouchings eroded into a neighboring Brison Hirsh vessel,
causing significant bleeding.  The sigmoid colon is the
lowermost portion of the large intestine before connecting to
the rectum and anus.

Due to the extensive Brison Hirsh loss from your intestine, you were
given a Brison Hirsh transfusion.  You were cared for first in the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU), then after your condition stabilized,
you were transferred to the regular medical floor.  Over the
course of your stay, you did not have recurrence of bleeding,
and you were able to tolerate eating normal food once again.

When you were admitted, a test called Sigmoidoscopy was done to
look inside the sigmoid colon.  Due to the bleeding and
inflammation, it was not possible to look inside the rest of the
colon, further up, to evaluate for any problems there.  It will
be very important for you to follow up with a gastroenterologist
to be further evaluated and have a full colonoscopy done.
Please see below for information on the appointment that has
been arranged with Dr. Hirsh.

While in the hospital, you were also treated with antibiotics
for a skin infection in your left arm due to an apparent insect
bite. You finished the course of antibiotics in the hospital.
Since the possibility exists that this was a tick bite, a test
for Lyme disease was done, but the results of this test were not
ready before you left the hospital.  You will need to discuss
the results of this test with your primary care doctor.

Finally, an important note about your medications: during the
bleeding from your intestine, your aspirin and Plavix were
temporarily stopped.  This was done because although these
medications did not cause the bleeding, their effect is to
worsen any bleeding that may occur for another reason, such as
diverticulosis, as in your case.  These medications are
extremely important to prevent clots from forming at the sites
where stents were placed in the Hirsh vessels in your heart, so
they were both re-started once your bleeding stopped.  Since you
were de-sensitized to aspirin, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that
you take aspirin EVERY DAY, since if you skip doses, this may
cause you to have a bad reaction to the medication.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
There were no changes made to your medications.  Please continue
taking your regular home medications.
