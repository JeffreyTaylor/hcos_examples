History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 59 year-old right-handed with progressively
worsening stiffness, weakness, and dysarthria since 2005-02-21 00:00:00 who is
sent in from her rehab for generalized weakness , decline and
difficulty eating. The patient is followed by Dr. Aleynah in the
movement disorders division who notes an extensive negative
workup in his most recent assessment of 2005-02-21 00:00:00 (see below).
Per
the record the stiffness started after a fall on ICE in 2005-02-21 00:00:00.
She
was admitted 7/21-26/07 for left leg dystonia. Possible
etiologies considered at that time included hereditary spastic
paraparesis, Parkinsons, and multiple systems atrophy. Little
evidence could be found for any of these disorders.


An new EMG today demonstrated a generalized, moderately severe,
chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons.


The patient has been on tizanidine, flexeril, baclofen, sinemet,
and artane - none with particularly significant effect.



Past Medical History:
depression,
rotator cuff injury,
osteopenia,
colectomy,
appendectomy
Per Dr.Aleynah Cosby 2005-02-21 00:00:00 note:
"Extensive prior evaluations were summarized in my note from 2005-02-21 00:00:00, 2005-02-21 00:00:00, including multiple brain and spine imaging studies
that
have failed to yield an explanation for her symptoms. She also
was admitted. She has had negative HTLV 1 and 2 testing,
negatively glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, negative
spinal fluid analyses including absence of oligoclonal bands,
normal ceruloplasmin, negative RPR, negative Lyme serology,
negative Deria Bassig, rheumatoid factor, and HIV test. EMG also was
reported to be normal in 08/2005-02-21 00:00:00. She was admitted in 2005-02-21 00:00:00

with increased mobility difficulties. The additional evaluation

did not reveal a clear etiology. They initiated a trial of
tizanidine, and this may have helped somewhat. They also reduced

her Flexeril dose."


Social History:
Ms. 123 Any St. Healthcare
Center nursing home.


Family History:
Notable for arthritis of the spine in her father
who also had limited use of one arm when he was older, but the
specifics again are difficult to clarify. She also has a son
with "arthrogryposis" who is in a wheelchair.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:98 P:96 R:18 BP:118/70 SaO2:95%RA

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: The patient regards the examiner and carries
papers with sheets of words that she points to in order to
communicate. She has another sheet with the alphabet on it that
she uses to spell out her words. She is able to communicate this
way however slowly. She indicated that she had heartburn. She
follows commands. Her responses to yes/no questions were correct
with vibration (versus not) of the tuning fork.



-Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested. PERRL 3 to 2mm and brisk.
VFF to confrontation. There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Funduscopic
exam was limited as the patient kept blinking and turning away.
EOMI without nystagmus. Normal saccades. Facial sensation intact
to pinprick. No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally. Palate elevates
symmetrically. 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes only minimally and is very slow from side to
side.



-Motor: Right upper extremity more mobile than left. Right upper
extremity is spastic. Left upper extremity is hypertonic and
flexed. Bilaterally lower extremities are extended even at the
ankle. They are extremely hypertonic. She can move both lower
extremites, but only at the hips and then only minimally.



-Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation,
vibratory sense, proprioception throughout.

Radiologic Data:
EMG:IMPRESSION:
Abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are most
consistent with a generalized, moderately severe, chronic and
ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons. The findings
do
not support stiff-person syndrome or dystonia.


CXR:IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process detected.


LENI: NO DVT in LLE.

VIDEO SWALLOW: IMPRESSION: Intermittent aspiration with thin
barium.

G-tube placement:
IMPRESSION: Successful percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube
placement. The tube is now ready for use.

PLAN: The T-fastener skin sutures (green-colored sutures) can be
cut and released in 2005-02-21 00:00:00 days (ON 2005-02-21 00:00:00).


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Cosby is a 59-year-old woman who was admitted for
further evaluation of her chronic progressive movement disorder.
Based on her exam, which with her progression by the time of
this admission showed mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs,
and based on her EMG on the day of admission showing motor
neuron disease, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS).

1. ALS. She was set up to follow up in the ALS clinic. After a
pulmonology consult, it was seen that she did well with her
respiratory status when sitting upright during the day, but has
paradoxical breathing at night. She was transferred for one
night to the ICU for BiPAP titration, and she should now use
this at night.

2. Dysphagia. She passed a swallow eval, but was given a PEG for
supplemental nutrition and with the expectation that her
dysphagia will progress. She can take some nutrition by mouth
and is getting tube feeds as in the discharge instructions.
*** The T-fastener skin sutures (green-colored sutures) can be
cut and released in 2005-02-21 00:00:00 days (between 2005-02-21 00:00:00 and 2005-02-21 00:00:00). ***

3. Spasticity. She was started on tizanidine (Zanaflex) and
Flexeril for painful spasticity, and was given a Lidoderm patch
for the pain. This did improve her, though she remains highly
spastic.

4. Anxiety. Psychiatry was consulted for her anxiety and
recommended Ativan as ordered (with caution for her respiratory
status) and Buspar, in addition to continuing her Lexapro.

5. CODE STATUS: After length discussions with her, she decided
to be a DNR/DNI.
