2007-01-21 00:00:00 Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA
showed a 40% tapering distal stenosis, which did not
angiographically
appear to be flow-limiting. The LAD showed a 60% proximal and
90%
midsegment stenosis. The LCX showed a 90% proximal stenosis
followed by
a 100% distal segment stenosis. The RCA showed mild diffuse
calcified
disease in the proximal and mid segments with a 100% stenosis in
the
posterolateral branch just distal to the right posterior
descending
artery, with left to right collaterals filling the distal right
posterolateral branch artery. The right acute marginal artery
showed a
100% stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography did not adequately visualize the
ventricular
lumen due to insufficient contrast volume. The LVEF was
approximately
50% with posterobasal akinesis and 2007-01-21 00:00:00+ mitral regurgitation.
3. Limited left-sided hemodynamics demonstrated severely
elevated left
ventricular end-diastolic pressures of 25 mmHg, suggestive of
severe
diastolic dysfunction.

2007-01-21 00:00:00 EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. There are Q waves in the
inferior leads
consistent with prior infarction. Low voltage. Compared to the
123 Any St.us tracing voltage has decreased.

2007-01-21 00:00:00 ECHO
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferolateral and basal lateral
with apical hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation present.
6.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Mclear Mclear was admitted to the UPMCE on 2007-01-21 00:00:00 for further
management of his chest pain and EKG changes. Heparin and
aspirin were continued without chest pain. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel
disease, 2007-01-21 00:00:00+ mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of
50%. Integrilin was started. Given the severity of his disease,
the cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. Mr. Mclear Mclear was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. As he elevated blood sugars, the Mclear
diabetes service was consulted for assistance with his
management. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an
ejection fraction of 40%, no mitral regurgitation, normal aortic
valve and diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis. Integrilin was
discontinued in preparation for cardiac surgery. On 2007-01-21 00:00:00, Mr.
Mclear Mclear was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. Mclear Mclear awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin and beta
blockade were resumed. He developed atrial fibrillation which
converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockade and
amiodarone. Later on postoperative day two, he was transferred
to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His drains and pacing wires
were removed without issue. Mr. Mclear Mclear continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative six. He
will follow-up with Dr. Annamaria Navrkal, his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
