Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Dariyan Stiemsma
Chief Complaint:
s/p collapse

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
79 yo F hx IDDM, HTN who presented after she collapsed in the
lobby of her building while awaiting her son to pick her up for
appointment to see her PCP.  Amontay Manzano was reportedly feeling well
recently according to son, no infectious symptoms.  She came
down to the lobby and sat in a chair while waiting and then
collapsed.  Pt had CPR initiated from bystanders (RN and aide in
lobby), per report EMS on presentation noted VFib, was
defibrillated 200J x1.  Review of provided strip appears to
demonsrate a NSR with artifact followed by shock and resumption
of NSR.  FS was 188, unresponsive, intubated in the field.  Pt
hypotensive to 60's on arrival to ED, rec'd 1.5 L NS, started on
levophed transiently.  Pt had head, chest/abd CTs performed
which were unrevealing.

CXR:
No priors available for comparison. Today's examination is
markedly limited by low lung volumes causing crowding of the
bronchovascular structures. The right hemidiaphragm is
asymmetrically elevated in comparison to the left hemidiaphragm.
There is marked distention of the stomach and abdominal bowel
likely related to resuscitative effort. Slightly increased
spacing between the gastric bubble and the left hemidiaphragm
may suggest a component of subpulmonic effusion. There is an
ill-defined retrocardiac opacity which may reflect atelectasis
and/or sequelae of aspiration. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7
cm from the carina. The aorta is slightly ectatic and calcified
and there is multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. No
pneumothorax or large effusions are identified.

IMPRESSION:

1) Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube. Gaseous
distention of stomach and bowel likely related to resuscitative
efforts. NGT may be of benefit.

2) Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis
and/or sequelae from aspiration.

CTA Torso:
1. No etiology for acute arrest identified. No PE or aortic
dissection. Mild dilatation of the right main pulmonary artery
may suggest underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.

2. Moderate amount of secretions distal to the endotracheal tube
within the trachea proximal to the carina may place the patient
at risk for aspiration.

3. Non-obstructive left renal calculi and simple left renal
cyst.

4. Incompletely characterized right adrenal lesion, likely
benign on patient of this age. Hypoattenuating right thyroid
lesion also likely benign in a patient's age.

5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

6. Extensive vasculopathy. Is there a history of diabetes?

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

EEG:
 This is an abnormal EEG due to the existence of an active
area of epileptogenesis in the left posterior frontal to
anterior
temporal region. Though this activity did not meet criteria for
focal
status epilepticus, there were periods of apparent
electrographic
seizures without evident clinical correlate. The presence of a
slow and
disorganized background is consistent with a moderate
encephalopathy of
toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  2008-02-15 00:00:00 9:17 PM
1. No fracture or malalignment is detected.
2. Diffuse calcification of the transverse ligament adjacent to
the dens causes severe canal narrowing and cord impingement. The
thecal sac measures approximately 5 mm at this area.
3. Hyperdense focus within the lower pole of pons and upper
medulla, might represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage or
cavernoma.
4. Bilateral thyroid nodules which can be further evaluated on
nonemergent basis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  2008-02-15 00:00:00 9:15 PM
SMALL INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMOORHAGE IN THE OCCIPITAL HORNS AND
SMALL FOCUS OF HEMORRHAGE IN THE UPPER MEDULLA. HOWEVER, THE
CAUSE OF THIS IS UNCERTAIN FROM THE PRESENT STUDY. A CLOSE
FOLLOW-UP EXAMINATION OR MR HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST,
WOULD BE HELPFUL.

MRI HEAD/CSPINE 2008-02-15 00:00:00
1-cm hemorrhagic non-enhancing lesion of the caudal medulla with
expansion and edema. This finding may represent a hemorrhagic
infarct versus a cavernoma. Given the findings on the concurrent
MR cervical spine, a hemorrhagic infarct is favored. Hemorrhagic
neoplasm is thought to be less likely given the lack of contrast
enhancement and no prior history of cancer.
Multiple extra-axial partially calcified enhancing masses as
described above consistent with meningiomas.
Intraventricular blood as before.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with syncope of unknown etiology, but
likely secondary to ischemia/hemorrhage in her caudal medulla
and also found to have cervical lesion and edema causing canal
stenosis and compression. She was initially treated with cooling
protocol due to possible cardiac arrest, but found to be in
sinus rhythm. Patient was intubated and not breathing
spontaneously. Initially, patient evaluated by CT head on 2008-02-15 00:00:00
that showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass. Unable to do MRI
as patient with staples from prior meningioma surgery from
2008-02-15 00:00:00. We did daily neurologic assessments to follow recovery
s/p cooling protocol, showing patient was awake, sometimes
tracking with her eyes, with some facial movements, but not
moving any extremities. Repeat CT head/spine on 2008-02-15 00:00:00 showing
multiple hemorrhages including a lesion in her caudal medulla
and edema/mass around her cervical spine. Neurology was
following and after speaking to neuroradiology, patient was
deemed safe to have MRI evaluation. On 2008-02-15 00:00:00, patient evaluated
by MRI which showed same findings. Read of MRI showing two
hemorrhagic/ischemic lesions of the caudal medulla and cervical
cord with severe cord compression. No indication for any
surgical intervention per neurosurg and neurology.Patient
trialed twice on PSV with no spontaneous respirations. One week
after insult, family meeting arranged to discuss poor prognosis
given lack of recovery and goals of care. Family made decision
not to remove care but to place patient on spontaneous breathing
trial without reinstating intubation.  The patient failed the
the SBT and expired 8 minutes afterwards.
