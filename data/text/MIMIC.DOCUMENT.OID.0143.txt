Attending:Cubert Roedema
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2009-06-08 00:00:00 Four Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old with known coronary artery disease. Over
the last several months, he began to experience worsening chest

artery disease. Based upon the above results, he was referred
for coronary surgical intervention.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate ?pneumomediastinum

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with h/o MI 2009-06-08 00:00:00, presented for cath found to
have 3VD.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate ?pneumomediastinum
INDICATIONS: 72-year-old man with recent coronary artery bypass
graft surgery.

CHEST, PA AND LATERA: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
[**Year (4 digits) 1488**]. There is persistent large left-sided pleural effusion
with atelectasis. A small [**Year (4 digits) 1488**] right pleural effusion is
also noted. A tiny focus of air in the anterior mediastinum
persists.

IMPRESSION: Similar large left-sided pleural effusion. Tiny
post-operative air collection of 8 mm in diameter, [**Year (4 digits) 1488**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. Jonbenet R. Cubert Roedema

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.1 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec

Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 2.33

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly
depressed LVEF.
No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid
anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in ascending
aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally

Conclusions:
Prebypass

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mild
hypokinesia of the apex of the anterior wall, mid and apical
portions of the
anterior septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly
depressed.

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic
aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
annulus is
not dilated.

Post bypass: Pt is being AV paced and is on an infusion of
phenylephrine

1. Biventricular function is preserved.

2. MR Jonbenet Stroebel in severity

3. Aorta and interatrial septum are intact post decannulation

4. Other findings are Stroebel

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Stroebel was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. Given his renal insufficiency, BUN and
creatinine were monitored very closely. His creatinine peaked to
2.2 on postoperative day two. By discharge, his renal function
returned to baseline. He was also noted to have diffuse ST
elevation on electrocardiogram consistent with pericarditis and
eventually went on to develop atrial flutter. Beta blockade was
advanced.  K and Mg levels were monitored and repleted per
protocol. He otherwise continued to make clinical improvements
with diuresis and physical therapy. He developed LUE
thrombophlebitis on POD#7 and was treated with Vanco and
evaluated by Vasc. Cubert Roedema. who felt surgical intervention was not
indicated.  His forearm improved and he was discharged to home
on POD#8 in stable condition.  He was anticoagulated with
coumadin and will have his INR followed by Dr. Jonbenet.
