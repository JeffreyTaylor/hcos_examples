Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from UPMCE Hospital after 3 days of
worsening abdominal pain, severe hypotension and lactic
acidosis. He was admitted to UPMCE hospital on 2011-10-24 00:00:00
morning, was intubated, started on pressors and antibiotics and
after notifying the transplant center, he was transferred in the
afternoon and admitted to the surgical ICU of UPMCE. Patient was
started on neo-synephrine, norepinephrine and vasopressin,
continued of broad spectrum antibiotics and attempted to correct
his coagulopathy with blood products prior to perform a
diagnostic paracentesis with hepatology. This showed 500 WBC and
25,500 RBC, but no microorganisms on the gram stain. A right
chest thoracentesis for a large right pleural was also performed
by the SICU to improve his ventilatory settings and improve his
oxygenation, which drained 1,5 L of fluid. Patient tolerated
both procedures well initially, but was never stable enough to
bring him to CT scan. At midnight he started with increasing
pressure requirement and was maximized on neo-synephrine,
levophed and vasopressin.
His profound lactic acidosis with a worsening lactate up to 11.3
was attempted to be corrected with sodium bicarb, with no
improvement on his pH of 7.10. His wife was Jadyne Lowdermilk, who
decided to continue measures and after giving 5L of fluids
including crystalloids, colloids, blood and at a maximum dose of
3 pressures, he was not able to hold his BP. Patient expired on
2011-10-24 00:00:00 at 01:40 am, after his the pastor of his church arrived
to the SICU. His wife Cailon Hasstedt while she was on
her way. The admitting office was notified and the Medical
Examiner waived the case. His family consented for an autopsy
which will be done at UPMCE.
