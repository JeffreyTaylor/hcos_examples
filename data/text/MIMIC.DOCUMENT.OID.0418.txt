History of Present Illness:
This is a 73-year-old male who had a history of
coronary artery disease and had underwent a left internal
mammary artery H grafted with a radial artery to the left
anterior descending artery through a left anterior
thoracotomy many years ago. He had progressive shortness of
breath and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with
aortic valve area of 0.8 cm squared and moderate mitral
regurgitation. His ejection fraction was estimated to be
about a 25%. He also underwent a cardiac catheterization
which demonstrated that his H graft to the left anterior
descending artery was patent. He had a totally occluded left
anterior descending artery proximally. He also had
significant stenosis of his left circumflex artery and right
coronary artery.

It was recommended that he undergo a coronary artery bypass
grafting, aortic valve replacement, and possible mitral valve
repair/replacement. After the risks and benefits were
explained to the patient he agreed to proceed.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include
hypokinesis of septum, anterior, posterior and lateral walls at
the bases, and
akinesis of all mid-segments and apex. There is moderate global
right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in
the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three thickened aortic valve leaflets.
There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
(2009-10-12 00:00:00+) mitral
regurgitation with a central jet is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB: A well-seated and functioning prosthetic aortic valve
is seen. There
are no leaks. No AI. MR is 1+. Aorta is intact. Both ventricles
show slight
improvement in global systolic fxn. (The patient is on low-dose
epinephrine.)
Other parameters as pre-bypass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted after cardiac cath overnight, then
underwent an uncomplicated AVR with 23mm pericardial valve and
redo cabgx3. Patient came of CPB in the OR without incident, and
was treansferred to the csru intubated. pressors were weaned
that nights, and patient was extubated on POD1 after ppf was
switched to precedex for agitation when weaning. CTs were dc'd
on POD1, bblocker and asa started. He was then transferred to
the floor on POD2 after doing very well. Lopressor was gradually
increased for sinus tachycardia but was then swtiched to
carvedalol (his home med) to better control his HR&BP. Patient
was tolerating a regular diet ambulating well when he was
discharged home on POD5.
