HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
gentleman with a long history of end-stage renal disease
secondary to polycystic kidney disease. He also had
polycystic liver disease that was complicated by an infected
cyst involving the liver that ruptured into the pericardium
necessitating a prolonged hospitalization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
2013-07-24 00:00:00, with congestive heart failure. He underwent
further evaluation and was found to have a pericardial
tamponade secondary to a rupture of infected hepatic cyst
into his pericardium. He had a pericardial window done in the
past with Dr. Baileyann Jeudy Zilberberg and abdominal incision at that
point in time we removed the lateral segment of the liver to
include the cyst. His postoperative course from that episode
was long and prolonged and he eventually was able to recover,
but he presented on 2013-07-24 00:00:00 with sepsis. A tube was
placed into his pericardium and fluid demonstrated high white
count consistent with pericarditis.

He was taken to the operating room on 2013-07-24 00:00:00, where he
underwent a pericardial window. Despite this, he continued to
remain septic with pressor requirements and acidosis. At that
point in time, we were concerned that he, in fact, had a
visceral perforation that had contaminated the communication
between his pericardium and his abdominal cavity and he was
taken emergently to the operating room on 2013-07-24 00:00:00,
where he was found to have a perforation of the sigmoid
colon. He underwent sigmoid colectomy and colostomy with a
long Hartmann pouch at that point in time. He developed
bilateral DVTs and a filter was placed on 2013-07-24 00:00:00. Despite
this, he continued to have  problems with multisystem organ
failure with hyperbilirubinemia, elevated white count. He
underwent a number of CT scans that demonstrated no intra-
abdominal fluid collections, but findings suspicious for a
bilious/postoperative bowel obstruction. He underwent
exploratory laparotomy on 2013-07-24 00:00:00, that did not
demonstrate any intra-abdominal complications. There was no
evidence of bowel obstruction. On 2013-07-24 00:00:00, he
underwent a tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical
ventilation. Over the next 72 hours, his condition
deteriorated and on 2013-07-24 00:00:00, he expired.
