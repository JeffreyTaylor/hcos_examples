HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty stent of the
right coronary artery in 5/99 and catheterization in 3/2012-05-04 00:00:00.
She was doing well without chest pain, but had dyspnea on
exertion for one to two months and recently felt fatigued.
She had a positive ETT and thallium test on 2012-05-04 00:00:00, which
revealed 2 to 123 Any St. depressions inferolaterally and chest
pain at 4.5 minutes of exercise.  She underwent a cardiac
catheterization at UPMCE on
2012-05-04 00:00:00, which showed good ejection fraction and trace mitral
regurgitation of left ventricular, short LMCA, two serial 60
to 70% lesions in the mid left anterior descending coronary
artery, 85% at the origin of the large diagonal artery, 60%
origin at the high diagonal almost to the ramus, 95% lesion
of the origin of the obtuse marginal one, 95% LCX after
obtuse marginal one, effecting more distal second obtuse
marginal, distal AV groove LCX occlusion before PLV branch.
Mild mid right coronary artery lesion, 90% lesion just before
very large PDA, which is collateral source to LCX and left
anterior descending coronary artery diagonal territory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty stent of right coronary
artery in 5/99.  Status post catheterization in 3/2012-05-04 00:00:00.
2.  Hypertension.

1.  Ecotrin 25 mg po q.d.
2.  Lopressor 100 mg po b.i.d. and 50 po q.h.s.
3.  Diovan 160 mg po q day.
4.  Lipitor 40 mg po q day.
5.  Premarin .6 mg po q.d.
6.  Meclozine 12.5 mg po q.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is and has been always a nonsmoker.  No
alcohol.  The patient lives alone.

ALLERGIES:  Diuril.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is in no acute
distress.  AVSS.  HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck supple.  Full
range of motion.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Carotids 2+ without bruits bilaterally.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender
without masses or tenderness.  Extremities without clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Pulse 2+ bilaterally.  Neurological
nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
2012-05-04 00:00:00 and received preop evaluation.  On 2012-05-04 00:00:00 the
patient was taken to the Operating Room where a four vessel
coronary artery bypass graft was performed.  The patient
initially appeared to tolerate the procedure quite well, but
in the end had to return to the Operating Room for
reexploration secondary to bleeding.  The patient was then
taken to the CSRU where she appeared to do well for the most
part.  She did at one time have atrial fibrillation and V
tach for which she was treated successfully.  Cardiology,
electrophysiology and medicine were all three consulted to
aid in the management of Ms. Mines condition, in particular
her cardiac instability while in the Intensive Care Unit.  A
carotid ultrasound was performed while in house showing mild
plaque blockage bilaterally.  Physical therapy was also
consulted while she was here and the patient did well with
ambulating with work.  The patient was also seen by nutrition
who greatly helped in the patient's dietary needs.  Once
stable the patient was transferred to the floor where she
continued to do well.  However, on 2012-05-04 00:00:00 the patient tested
positive for an enterococcal urinary tract infection.  The
patient also experienced some diarrhea.  The patient was
tested for C-diff, which came back negative.

On 2012-05-04 00:00:00.  The patient had a renal ultrasound to rule out
renal artery stenosis, which turned out to be negative
bilaterally, however, it did indicate large pleural effusion.
A chest x-ray was performed, which showed a large left
pleural effusion.  That evening the patient was given a
pigtail chest tube, which allowed the effusion to drain.
Overnight the patient put out approximately 1.2 liters of
fluid.  It is our intention to x-ray her this morning.
Provided that the effusion is well drained we will remove the
chest tube, re-x-ray her to assure that pneumothorax has not
developed.  If this is confirmed the patient will be
discharged today on 2012-05-04 00:00:00 to a rehab facility.  She is to
follow up with her primary care physician in one to two
weeks, her cardiologist in two to three weeks and Dr. Allisandra Rusignuolo
in four weeks.
