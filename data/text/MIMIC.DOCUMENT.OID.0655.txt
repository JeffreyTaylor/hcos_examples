Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81 year old Russian-speaking female with a
history of HOCM s/p septal EtOH ablation in 2009-12-21 00:00:00, CHF EF >70%,
nonobstructive CAD by cath '2009-12-21 00:00:00, mild dementia, CRI (baseline
1.9) , DMII who is admitted to the ICU on 2009-12-21 00:00:00 for suspected
pneumosepsis.

She had been recently hospitalized from 2009-12-21 00:00:00 for a CHF
exacerbation in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension.
She was seen by cardiology who started her on lisinopril and
HCTZ. On her day of discharge she was given a influenza vaccine
which resulted in chills and myalgia but she was discharged home
regardless.

 While at home she continued to have subjective fevers and
chills but per her daughter she had no measurable temperature.
She had worsening SOB despite taking all of her medications with
a productive cough. She denied CP but did feel some chest
tightness. She had poor a123 Any St.e with mild nausea w/o vomiting,
and denied abdominal pain or dysuria. At 11pm the night prior to
admission, she could not even lay down to sleep so she called
her daughter who called 911.

 In the ED she was hypertensive with SBP of 145 and her CXR was
read as mild CHF, no pneumonia with a  pro-BNP of 13,431 (up
from 4107 during her recent hospitalization). She was given 20mg
IV lasix and dropped her SBP to the 85/54 from 142 with a fever
to 100.5.

A sepsis line was placed and she was given Vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and flagyl for empiric ? aspiration PNA coverage.
SBP improved to 100s with 500cc NS bolus so no vasopressors were
initiated. The ED staff was also concerned about ST dep inf on
ECG and started heparin gtt for ACS.

Her EKG showed SR 70s, LVH, increased voltage, downward sloping
ST segments V4-V6, I, AVL with TWI with 3 mm STE V1-V3 (old from
2009-12-21 00:00:00). No Q waves. Troponin was 0.04-0.02 on admission. CK
test@mail.com with an MB <10. She ruled out for an MI.

She was admitted to the UPMCE for further monitoring for sepsis.
They felt she was overdiuresed in the emergency department and
became tachycardic, which further exacerbated her tenuous
baseline volume status. She was maintained euvolemic in the ICU.
 Her heart rate was controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol
with a goal rate in the 60s. On the night of admission, she had
a run of VT (60 beats?) with a right central line placement
which resolved spontaneously. Her electrolytes were buffed, and
the VT was thought to be secondary to stretch. Cardiology
followed her throughout her UPMCE stay.

She was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for a total of 14
days for pneumonia. She was also found to have a UTI which grew
pansensitive Klebsiella and E. Coli on Cx, which were covered by
her ceftriaxone.

She was continued on aspirin, beat-blocker, statin. Her ACE was
restarted on discharge from the ICU as her creatinine returned
back to baseline. She was ruled out for MI with three sets of
negative cardiac enzymes.

Regarding her HOCM, she was maintained on diltiazem 30 mg QID,
lopressor titrated up to 37.5 TID. She was transferred to UPMCE
for HOCM ablation on Friday.

At present, complains of shortness of breath and cough. Denies
any chest pain/pressure.

Underwent successful ETOH ablation of S1 on 2009-12-21 00:00:00 and
transferred to CCU post-procedure with temporary pacing wire for
close observation. The temp wire was removed without evidence of
CHB on 2009-12-21 00:00:00 without events.

Last echo prior to septal ablation was 2009-12-21 00:00:00 :


Left Ventricle - Peak Resting LVOT gradient: *96 mm Hg (nl <= 10
mm Hg). TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *78 to 85 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm
Hg). Left Atrium  *7.1 cm Right Atrium - *6.2 cm
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.6 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
a severe
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The findings
are
consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
mitral annular
calcification. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no
pericardial effusion.
  .
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2009-12-21 00:00:00, the
severity of
the mitral regurgitation has increased. The estimated pulmonary
artery
systolic pressures are markedly higher. The severity of
pulmonary
regurgitation has increased. The severity of tricuspid
regurgitation has also
increased.
  .
Echo prior to septal ablation 2009-12-21 00:00:00:
There is prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
small cavity
and hyperdynamic systolic function (EF>75%). There is valvular
Jerrian Alvi with a
severe (57mmHg peak) resting LVOT gradient. Right ventricular
cavity size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
The mitral leaflets are thickened. There is severe mitral
annular
calcification. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral
valve leaflets.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
  .
Following injection of diluted Definity contrast into the sepal
artery, there
is prompt hyperenhancement of the RV side of the basal septum
and extending
into an RV band.
.
Post septal ablation on 2009-12-21 00:00:00:
.
Following injection of 1cc of ethanol, there was prompt
hyperenhancement of
the basal septum, extending to a muscle band in the right
ventricle. The LVOT
gradient declined to a peak of 45mmHg. There was mild-moderate
mitral
regurgitation.
.
Following injection of another 0.5cc of ethanol, the peak LVOT
gradient
declined to 34mmHg. Valvular Jerrian Alvi persisted with mild mitral
regurgitation.
Additional Doppler suggests mild mitral stenosis (possibly
related to MAC) and
mild aortic regurgitation
.
Furthermore, her cath on 2009-12-21 00:00:00 showed a right dominant system
with a patent LMCA, mid LAD and LCX with 70% calcified lesions,
RCA with 40% ostial disease.
C.CATH Study Date of 2009-12-21 00:00:00:

COMMENTS:
1. Selective cine angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
mild to moderate single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
was
free of angiographically significant stenosis. The LAD had a mid
40%
stenosis, otherwise rest of the LAD including the major diagonal
branch
were free of stenosis. The LCX had no significant stenosis. The
OM1 was
normal, OM2 had a 40% proximal stenosis, the OM3 was normal. The
RCA was
had no angiographcally significant stenosis. The PDA had a
proximal 50%
stenosis. The RPLV branch had no significant disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic hypertension,
moderate
to severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated left heart filling

pressures.
3. Left ventriculography in the Lataiya Freshcorn projection revealed normal
LV size
and systolic function, 2+MR.
4. Successful ethanol ablation of the second septal perforator
