Pertinent Results:
Echo 2014-06-17 00:00:00: PRE-CPB: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic root is mildly dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. There is
moderate mitral stenosis. POST: Preserved biventricular systolic
function. Bioprosthesis in aortic position/Well seated and
mechanically stable/good leaflet excursion. No AI. No other
change in valve structure and function.
Head CT 2014-06-17 00:00:00: No evidence acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. Punctate hypodensities in the right basal ganglia, and
in the left parietal lobe. If there is concern for embolic
phenomenon, an MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is
recommended. Stable prominent perivascular spaces in the
superior frontal lobes bilaterally.
Neck CT 2014-06-17 00:00:00: No hemodynamically significant stenosis
identified.
EEG 2014-06-17 00:00:00: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in
drowsiness progressing to stage II of sleep with brief periods
of wakefulness due to the presence of multifocal mixed theta and
delta frequency slowing. This finding suggests multifocal
bilateral subcortical dysfunction and is nonspecific, but could
be consistent with vascular insufficiency. The background
slowing indicates a beginning, mild widespread encephalopathy or
represents a drowsy state. There were no clear epileptiform
abnormalities recorded.
CXR 2014-06-17 00:00:00: Persistent left basilar atelectasis/effusion.
Resolution of right apical pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Hugg was electively admitted on 2014-06-17 00:00:00 for valve
replacement. She was brought to the operating room this day
where she underwent an aortic valve replacement (tissue). Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following the
procedure she was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Chest
tubes were removed on post-op day one. Beta blockers and
diuretics were started and she was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. Later on this day she appeared to be doing well
was transferred to the telemetry floor. Later on post-op day one
she appeared to have decreased mental status. She was
transferred back to the CSRU and a CT was performed and Stroke
team consulted. CT was questionable for left CVA. On post-op day
two she underwent a neck CT and EEG (please see pertinent
results). Her epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op
day three. Her mental status and extremity weakness slowly
improved and on post-op day four she was transferred back to the
step-down floor. It appeared on this day she had a UTI and
cultures were still pending at time of discharge. She was
empirically started on antibiotics. Her medications were
titrated for maximum BP and HR control. Physical therapy worked
with pt during entire post-op course for strength and mobility.
She appeared to be doing well with stable labs and vital signs
and was discharged to rehab facility on post-op day six.
