Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to the ICU, Mr. Esmail was in hemodynamic shock
with blood pressure to SBP 60-70s.  Aggressive fluid
resuscitation was begun and a central line was placed without
complication.  Given further review of the patient's chart, it
was very clear that he had a DNR/DNI status, which he had
reiterated multiple times to several health care providers.
Multiple attempts were made to contact Ms. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 547**] Esmail, his
HCP, but no phone calls were returned.  The primary team
continued treatment for presumed septic shock and remained in
contact with toxicology given his elevated serum drug levels.
Not responding to fluid resuscitation, pressor agents were begun
with minimal effectiveness.
.
Approximately 8 hours after arriving in the ICU, Mr. Esmail
HCP Justinne Esmail Justinne Esmail Justinne Esmail the hospital confirming her phone
number had changed and not been updated in the medical record.
Additionally, she stated that the patient had been in physical
decline for some time and insisted on having DNR/DNI status.
Approximately one hour later the HCP and patient's mother, who
was his POA, arrived at the hospital.  A family meeting was held
in which both individuals insisted we follow Mr. Esmail wishes
and remove invasive medical care.  In line with his wishes,
pressors were stopped and he was extubated.  Mr. Esmail went
into asystole within minutes and was pronounced dead at 5:55pm
on 2009-11-16 00:00:00.
