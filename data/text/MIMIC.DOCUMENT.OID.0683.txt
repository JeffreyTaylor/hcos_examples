Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who
presented with acute intoxication. He was monitored for 1 day in
the ICU prior to call out to the floor. Pt ultimately left AMA.
.
# Alcohol Withdrawal: Pt reported his last drink was 1 day PTA
2012-10-18 00:00:00; has h/o seizures associated w/withdrawal and stated
that his last seizure was 3 weeks prior to admission. During his
ICU course the pt was kept on a PO valium CIWA scale q1 hours.
In addition he received MVI/Thiamine/Folate, a social work
consult called, and was placed on aspiration precautions. A
dilantin level was checked and found to be sub-therapeutic. The
pt was restarted on dilantin. Upon call out to the floor, he
required 20 mg Valium in a period of 12 hours. He was noted to
have a DBP of 115 with some mild tremors and diaphoresis, as
well as difficulty ambulating. He was requesting to sign out
AMA, at which point security sitters monitored the patient until
it was deemed pt had capacity to leave. Several hours later, the
patient was still agitated, stating he wanted to leave b/c he
had obligations in the afternoon, and that he understood if he
left he could die or have seizures. A psychiatry consult was
requested, but the pt became extremely angry, was ambulating
with mild staggering gait but mostly steady, and did appear to
have capacity, so the patient was signed out AMA prior to
psychiatry being able to formally evaluate pt. Attempt was made
to call pts PCP, Karismah Pierini went into voicemail. Pt was asked to f/u
with his PCP the following day, was seen by SW, and given phone
numbers for detox centers. He stated he was going to go back to
drinking after discharge. He was noted discharged on dilantin as
this was stopped per prior d/c summary when PCP told the
