Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 85-year-old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's
disease, who was admitted after being found unresponsive at
home.  The patient was in her usual state of health until 1
P.M. on the day of admission, when she was found by her
cousin, who lives with her.  The patient was unresponsive,
apparently no longer than 30 seconds.  She slumped forward,
and EMS was called.  There were no preceding palpitations,
shortness of breath, chest pain, focal weakness, dysarthria,
bowel or bladder incontinence, or seizure activity noted.
EMS noted the patient to have a finger stick blood glucose of
240, atrial fibrillation on the monitor, with a rate of 100,
blood pressure of 136/palp, respiration rate of 4, and
initially unresponsive.  Her pupils were equal, round and
reactive to light.

The patient was intubated and, during intubation, she was
noted to have increased agitation.  She was given 2 mg of
Versed, successfully intubated, and sent to UPMCE, where she was immediately brought
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival, she was
hemodynamically stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure, last echocardiogram in 2009-12-06 00:00:00 showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, and 1+ aortic
insufficiency and mitral regurgitation.  There was normal
right ventricular function.  She was admitted in 2009-12-06 00:00:00 with increasing peripheral edema and orthopnea.  She was
diuresed 3 liters, ruled out by enzymes, and had a negative
ETT MIBI.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia

SOCIAL HISTORY:   She lives with her cousin.  She is
minimally ambulatory at baseline.  She uses a wheelchair and
a walker, needs help with her activities of daily living.
She quit tobacco 15 years ago.  The patient had been at
UPMCE Home for approximately one and a half
months following her 2009-12-06 00:00:00 admission for congestive heart
failure.  While there, she had been placed on supplemental
oxygen by nasal cannula.  She was discharged home on oxygen
one and a half weeks prior to her readmission.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, white blood cells 4.1,
hematocrit 29.2, platelets 227.  PT 13.3, PTT 29.9, and INR
1.2.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.8, chloride 94, bicarbonate 33,

osmolality 298.  CPK and troponin were negative.  Urinalysis
was negative for urinary tract infection.  Serum toxicology
screen was negative.   Urine toxicology screen was positive
for benzodiazepines.  Arterial blood gas was 7.55/36/220 on
100% FIO2 with the ventilator settings as listed above.  CT
scan of the head showed no intracerebral bleed.  Chest x-ray
showed bilateral hilar fullness and upper zone
redistribution.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at
78, with normal axis.  There were peaked T waves in Leads V2
through V6.  There were no ST or T changes suggestive of
ischemia, no Q waves consistent with electrocardiogram
performed in 2009-12-06 00:00:00.

IMPRESSION:   This was an 85-year-old woman with a history of
diastolic dysfunction, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's
disease, who was found unresponsive and intubated in the
field, but whose neurologic function upon admission appeared
to be at baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Initially the patient's primary disorder
was thought to be neurologic in origin.  Therefore, the
Neurology service was consulted.  It was thought that perhaps
the patient had a basilar artery transient ischemic attack.
A head CT was performed, and this was negative.  Therefore,
it was thought that the patient did not have a primary
neurologic event.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
There was no recurrence of the atrial fibrillation noted on
the monitor in the field.  Her aspirin, atenolol, Zestril and
Lipitor were continued.

Two days after admission, on the 2009-12-06 00:00:00, while the
patient's cousin was visiting, the patient was noted to slump
over and become unresponsive for a second time.  Rhythm strip
showed junctional escape with a heart rate of 15.  She was
assumed to be in bradycardic arrest.  She was intubated for a
second time, and the electrophysiology division of the
Cardiology service was consulted.  She was thought to have a
sick sinus syndrome, and a DDD pacer was placed.  Lasix was
given for diuresis.  She received bronchoscopy, which removed
a large dried mucous plug at the tip of the endotracheal
tube.  Bronchial washings from that bronchoscopy revealed
only gram-negative rods on Gram Neve, [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on
ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

The following day, on the 2009-12-06 00:00:00, she was extubated.
However, she required very high levels of oxygen to maintain
her saturations above 90%.  To investigate this, a chest
x-ray was performed which revealed bilateral pleural
effusions, as well as cardiomegaly.  An echocardiogram was
performed that showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, preserved left ventricular function with an
ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal right ventricular
systolic function, trace aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion.  There was no
change compared to the echocardiogram performed in 2009-12-06 00:00:00.

In light of these findings, we postulated that the cause of
her poor oxygenation was multifactorial, including
restrictive lung disease from obesity and cardiomegaly, as
well as her pleural effusions.  She was continued on lasix
for diuresis and, on 2009-12-06 00:00:00, was transferred to the
general medical floor for further management.

On 2009-12-06 00:00:00, while in the Radiology Department following an
x-ray, she was found on the stretcher with an ashen
appearance, diaphoretic, and unresponsive.  A code was
called.  Her portable oxygen tank was noted to be empty.
When her mask was hooked up to wall oxygen, she gradually
gained consciousness and there were no residual deficits.

On 2009-12-06 00:00:00, she underwent thoracentesis on the right, which
was the larger of her effusions.  300 cc of serosanguinous
exudative fluid were drained.  The cytology was negative.

The following day, she underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy,
which was essentially unremarkable.  Later that night, she
had increasing hypoxia, a temperature of 100.8, a white count
of 14, and a chest x-ray which showed increasing bilateral
effusions.  She had warm extremities.  Therefore, it was felt
that she was likely in septic shock with bacterial source
being from a primary pulmonary infection.  She was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where central
access was obtained and she was started on dopamine for
pressure support.  She received noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation and nebulized treatments.  A CT scan of the chest
on 2009-12-06 00:00:00 showed moderate bilateral effusions and
multifocal opacities, consistent with pneumonia.  Incidental
note was made of a left adrenal mass, most consistent with an
adenoma.  Since she developed this pneumonia while she was in
the hospital, we covered her broadly with vancomycin,
ceftazidime and Flagyl.  We continued with NIPPV for two more
days, but she did not significantly improve.  Therefore, on
2009-12-06 00:00:00, she was reintubated.  Fentanyl was used for
sedation, and dopamine was continued.

The following day, she received diagnostic bronchoscopy for a
specimen collection, but these grew only oropharyngeal flora.
Thus in the absence of a predominant pathogen, her antibiotic
therapy was eventually changed to levofloxacin and Flagyl on
2009-12-06 00:00:00.  On that same day, she was changed from assist
control mode to SIMV plus pressure support.  She tolerated
this well.  She had a very brief temperature spike to 101.4
on 2009-12-06 00:00:00, but no increase in white count was noted, and
she had no subsequent temperature spikes.

In light of the patient's very slow recovery from her
pneumonia, multiple discussions were held with the patient as
well as with her family to discuss the patient's end of life
issues.  The patient made it very clear that she wished to
proceed with maximal medical management providing that she
still had a chance to recover from her pneumonia.  Therefore,
on 2009-12-06 00:00:00, she received tracheotomy and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy for anticipated discharge to inpatient
rehabilitation.

Additional aspects of her hospital stay were as follows:
Cardiovascular:  We discontinued the patient's beta blockade
and ACE inhibitor in light of her hypotension.  We continued
her Lipitor and aspirin.

Gastrointestinal:  She was placed on Prevacid for
gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

Nutrition:  She was fed by tube feeds via an orogastric tube,
which was later changed to a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.

Endocrine:  We maintained adequate blood glucose control via
NPH insulin and a regular insulin sliding scale.

Neurology:  We continued the patient on Neurontin and
Sinemet.

Hematology:  The patient has a baseline anemia, which
responded well to periodic transfusion.  Her baseline
hematocrit is approximately 30.0.

Prophylaxis:  The patient was on heparin for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis, and Prevacid for gastrointestinal
prophylaxis.

Code status:  With multiple discussions held with the patient
and her family, it was determined that she was Full Code.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to inpatient
rehabilitation once accepted at a rehabilitation facility.

Discharge instructions and medication list will be provided
on the discharge addendum.
