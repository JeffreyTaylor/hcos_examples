Pertinent Results:
2009-10-20 00:00:00 Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is elongated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or
the right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricle
displays normal free wall contractility. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Very trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. Corddaryl Kaemmer was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.
POST- BYPASS: There is normal biventricular systolic function.
The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation. No other
significant changes from the pre-bypass examination.

AM
Final Report : In comparison to the prior examination, there is
little interval change. The left apical pneumothorax is
unchanged in size. Bibasilar atelectasis remains as well as
small pleural effusions remain. There is a left upper lobe
opacity that likely represents pleural effusion within an
adhesion. Sternal wires are intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr Gosha was a same day admission for coronary bypass grafting
on 2009-10-20 00:00:00. Please see operative report for details, in
summary he had: Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with the left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
reverse saphenous vein grafts to the distal right coronary
artery, first and second obtuse marginal arteries. His bypass
time was 98 minutes, with a crossclamp time of 85 minutes. He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition.
Once in the ICU he remained hemodynamically stable, anesthesia
was reversed, he woke neurologically intact and was extubated.
On POD1 the patient remained hemodynamically stable and was
transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor. His chest tubes
remained to suction as he was noted to have na airleak.
Otherwise he was begun on Bblockers and diuretics and his
activity was advanced. On POD2 the chest tubes were put to water
seal, a follow up chest XRay revealed a pneumothorax and the
chest tubes were put back to suction. The chest tubes were
finally removed on POD4 All other tubes lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocols.
The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful, he worked
with nursing and physical therapy to increase his activity and
endurance. He was discharged home on POD5. He is to followup
w/Dr Gosha in 1 month.
