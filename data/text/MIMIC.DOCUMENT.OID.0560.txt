Micro:
-Blood cx (2014-07-26 00:00:00): PENDING
-Urine cx (2014-07-26 00:00:00): NEGATIVE
-Urine Legionalla Ag (2014-07-26 00:00:00): NEGATIVE
-Urine cx (2014-07-26 00:00:00): PENDING

EKG (2014-07-26 00:00:00): Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular
response. Non-specific ST-T wave changes, most notable in leads
VI-V2. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2014-07-26 00:00:00 atrial
fibrillation has replaced sinus bradycardia. The septal T wave
changes have been 123 Any St.usly noted.

TTE (2014-07-26 00:00:00): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension, with evidence of right ventricular
pressure overload and consequent ventricular interaction. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

AP PORTAL CHEST X-RAY (2014-07-26 00:00:00):
1. Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.
2. Ill-defined opacity in the left lung base is nonspecific, but
could
reflect an area of atelectasis, or possibly infection.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY (2014-07-26 00:00:00): There is unchanged
cardiomegaly. There is persistent atelectasis versus developing
infiltrate at the left lung base. This is stable. There are no
signs for overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces. Overall,
there has been no interval change.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY (2014-07-26 00:00:00): Cardiac silhouette is
enlarged. There is some atelectasis at the lung bases. There are
no signs for overt pulmonary edema.  There is some prominence of
some of the interstitial markings and atelectasis of the left
lung base which is stable. There is minimal wedging of several
mid thoracic vertebral bodies.

AP PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY (2014-07-26 00:00:00): Lung volumes are lower today,
exaggerating relative caliber of distended mediastinal veins and
the extent of moderate cardiomegaly. Thoracic aorta is quite
tortuous and aneurysm is not really evaluated by this study.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax.

V/Q SCAN (2014-07-26 00:00:00): Multiple mismatched perfusion defects
bilaterally consistent with very high likelihood ratio of acute
pulmonary embolus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Bourbon is a 46 y/o female with CAD/ CHF, afib, diabetes,
presenting from clinic with dyspnea.

# Dyspnea secondary to pulmonary embolism: Initially attributed
to diastolic CHF based on age, history of diabetes, JVP of
10-12cm and pleural effusion on CXR and BNP >10k, although dry
mucus membranes and no edema peripherally.  Diastolic
dysfunction was confirmed by echo.  Also initially considered
was PNA given hypothermia, but no history of cough and only mild
leukocytosis to 12.1k.  Initially Troponins negative x2 and no
evidence of ischemia by EKG.  Pulmonary embolism was also
initially considered, but other etiologies including diastolic
dysfunction were more likely initially and despite vague
shoulder pain, no frank chest pain and no stepwise changes in
dyspnea; patient described it as progressive shortness of
breath.

Patient treated on admission with 40IV lasix and was 1L negative
and the following day treated with 80mg PO lasix.  This was
repeated as the patient was not negative with 60mg IV lasix.
Patient was also emperically started on ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h
and Azithromycin 500mg PO q24h on admission. She was then
switched to PO levoquin and dyspnea continued, with
desaturations to the 80s with ambulation.

When patient did not improve with aggressive diuresis and
leukocytosis increased to 20K, other etiologies were
reconsidered.  Repeat troponins were not consistent with an
acute ischemic event.  AGB was consistent with primary metabolic
acidosis, with normal anion gap, with superimposed respiratory
alkalosis and an Aa gradient of approximately 50.  2014-07-26 00:00:00 VQ
scan was consistent with right > left sided pulmonary embolism.
Patient was started on IV heparin and warfarin PO.  Her
troponins began to increase and her urine output decreaed.  The
evening of 2014-07-26 00:00:00, patient's entered atrial fibrillation with RVR
with decreasing O2 saturations, decreasing blood pressure to 80s
systolic and no urine output. Patient was transferred to the ICU
for further care.

On arrival to the ICU patient was hypotensive to 80s,
tachycardic to 150s (AFib with RVR), satting in high 80s on NRB.
She was noted to have dusky, cool, pulseless LLE, possibly
arterial thrombus showered from atrium in setting of RVR. Failed
rate control with beta blockade. She was started on peripheral
norepinephrine and levophed drips for hypotension.

As her presentation was consistent with massive PE causing
hemodynamic instability, lysis with TPA was attempted. Before
this, ICU team spoke with daughter (HCP) in detail about
risks/benefits of TPA. Daughter specified she did not want
central line placed, and updated code status to DNR/DNI in light
of severity of her illness. Over the next six hours after TPA
infusion, patient's oxygen requirements continued to increase
and she became increasingly hypotensive with rising pressor
requirements and agonal breathing. In light of her failure to
respond to lysis, spoke with family again and patient was
transitioned to CMO with morphine drip for comfort. She passed
away at 11:49 am with family by the bedside.

# Presentation Hypothermia: 96.2/35.6 rectally, not quite
meeting SIRS criteria of <35.  ? infection as above versus other
process as hypothyroidism or poor cardiac output.  UA is clear
except for protein.  TSH and Free T4 normal.  Resolving the
following day with antibiotics and diuresis as above.  Patient
was normothermic during the remainder of the hospitalization.

# CAD: Per history.  No evidence of Q waves on EKG.  Echo
without wall motion abnormalities.  Patient was continued on ASA
81mg qd and simvastatin 40 mg daily

# DM complicated by protinuria. Patient was treated with an
insulin sliding scale, Lantus 10 units subcutaneously every
morning, which was increased to 14 units prior to transfer to
the unit for sugars in the 250 range.  We held glipizide 5 mg
daily

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS 2 of 4, although not anticoagulated
due to risk.  At home, on Toprol XL 50 mg daily.  Prior to
discovering the pulmonary embolism, we increased metoprolol
succinate 75mg qd for heart rate control to attempt to improve
forward flow and ASA 81mg qd

# Hypertension:  Fair control initially.  We held isosorbide
mononitrate 10 mg daily as patient is normotensive and
substituted Lisinopril 5mg qd in place of fosinopril 10 mg
daily.  This was discontinued on 2014-07-26 00:00:00 when patient entered into
Bourbon from combination of diuresis and pulmonary embolism

# Recent corneal transplant with history of glaucoma.  We
continued:
- brimonidine (Alphagan) P 0.1 % Eye Drops: 1 drop each eye UPMCE
- prednisolone acetate 1 %: 1 drop to right eye TID
