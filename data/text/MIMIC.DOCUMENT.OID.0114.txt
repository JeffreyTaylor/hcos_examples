Pertinent Results:
UPMCE STUDIES:

CXR (2011-09-12 00:00:00):  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The
thoracic aorta is
ectatic. There is minimal fibronodular opacity at the left apex.
A linear density along the right pleural margin is seen,
possibly consistent with a peripheral bulla. No focal pulmonary
parenchymal consolidation or pleural effusions. There is slight
fullness of the right hilum. The pulmonary vasculature appears
unremarkable. The surrounding osseous structures demonstrate
mild right convex thoracic scoliosis.

LE U/S (2011-09-12 00:00:00): IMPRESSION - No evidence of DVT in the left
lower extremity.

CTA CHEST (2011-09-12 00:00:00): IMPRESSION - Large bilateral pulmonary
emboli.

LE U/S (2011-09-12 00:00:00): IMPRESSION - No DVT of the right upper
extremity.

ECHO (2011-09-12 00:00:00): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but not stenotic. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared to the
prior report of 2011-09-12 00:00:00 (tape unavailable for review), there
left ventricular systolic function is now low normal. The right
ventricular systolic function appears preserved. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms Bornhorst was initially admitted to the UPMCE with bilateral
pulmonary emboli - she was soon transferred to the GeriMed
service.

1. Pulmonary Emboli: Presenting with hypoxia and shortness of
breath, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary
emboli diagnosed by CT. She never had hemodynamic compromise or
had evidence of right-heart strain as evidenced by ECHO.
However, she did have an initial 'troponin leak' which was a
marker of elevated right ventricular pressures. This soon
resolved. She was initiated on enoxaparin and warfarin therapy
in the UPMCE and then transferred to the GeriMed service. Her
hypoxia remitted soon after UPMCE call out and the patient
remained comfortable for the remainder of her course. A source
of her emboli or hypercoaguable status was not found (on
physical exam, by history or on lower extremity
ultrasonography). The etiology was considered likely related to
stasis as the patient was obese and used a cane to ambulate.
However, an occult neoplasm was considered possible despite a
lack of signs or symptoms. Also, other aquired and inheritable
causes for hypercoagulability were considered: Given her weakly
thrombophilic history, various laboratory studies were
recommended to be tested in the outpatient setting to determine
the appropriate duration of anticoagulation therapy, including
FVL, Prothrombin, APL and Homocysteine.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Dx: Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism.
Secondary Dx: Diabetes Mellitus, Anemia, and Hypertension.


Discharge Condition:
Good

Discharge Instructions:
1) Please call your doctor or return to the ED if you have any
shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain, or any other
concerning symptoms.
2) Take your new medications as instructed.
3) Please have your sister (a nurse) administer your Enoxaparin
for 5 more doses (your last dose will be Friday night).


Followup Instructions:
1) Please see Dr. Andrina Desosa Bornhorst (test@mail.com) on Friday,
2011-09-12 00:00:00 to have your INR checked (measures how well the
Coumadin is working). You will also go to his office on Monday,
2011-09-12 00:00:00 for another INR check. Dr. Bornhorst will
also address your Diabetes and discuss possible medications for
you. He will also check your HbA1C level (which evaluates how
high your blood sugars have been over a long period of time).
Finally, Dr. Bornhorst will also check various blood tests to
evaluate you the cause of your pulmonary embolism. He may decide
to refer you to a hematologist.
