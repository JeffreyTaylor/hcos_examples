History of Present Illness:
73yo F with PBC, decompensated cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy,
ascites, and esoph varices, who was discharged 2 days prior to
admission with AMS thought to be related to hepatic
encephalopathy. At that time she was also found to have
hypoglycemia, PNA (tx w/ Azithro), and a UTI (tx w/ Bactrim).
She was referred from clinic at UPMCE with chief
complaint of BRBPR. She noted 2 painless BM's with BRBPR, and
blood was noted on rectal exam without melena. She denied any CP
or SOB, but does note feeling weak. She does note some decreased
urine output lately, as well as increased LE edema and abdominal
distention. She notes abdominal 'fullness' for the last few
weeks, but denies nausea/vomiting. She notes some
lightheadedness and thirst while in the ED.
.
In the ED she was initially normotensive, but was later found to
have SBP's in the 70's (baseline SBP in 90's). She was also
noted to be hypothermic with core temp of 93.4. Because of
concern for sepsis an IJ was placed and she was placed on sepsis
protocol. She was given Vanc/CTX/Flagyl and hydrocort, and was
also noted to have worsening renal function with a Cr of 2.1
from NL baseline. Because of an initial potassium of 6.9, she
was given D50/insulin/kayexylate. She was admitted to the MICU
for further monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1. PBC cirrhosis x 13 yrs, known varices, followed by Dr.Rutledge
2. Liver cirrhosis
3. Hypothyroidism
4. Osteopenia
5. Status post cholecystectomy
6. History of ankle fractures
7. Hypertension

Social History:
Tobacco stopped 15 yrs ago, 30 pack-yrs, no alcohol or drug use,
married with three children. Lives at home with husband


Family History:
No family history of strokes, seizures.  Mother and father died
in 90s.

Physical Exam:
vitals (ED)- T=93.4(now ax95), HR=77, BP=114/33-70/48, RR=16,
O2sat 95%RA
General - alert, interactive, in NAD

Ext- 3+ pitting LE edema b/l
Neuro- AAO x 3, follows commands, +asterixis

Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen:
1. Diffuse anasarca with soft tissue edema as well as ascites
and nonspecific mesenteric stranding. Ascites is increased
compared to the 123 Any St.us study.
2. Limited evaluation of the bowel with no definite wall
thickening. There is no pneumatosis or free air. Patency within
mesenteric vessels cannot be assessed without IV contrast.
3. Acute right posterior rib fracture that does not appear to be
present on the study of 2012-03-24 00:00:00. No evidence of pneumothorax in
the imaged portions of the lungs.

CXR: The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are
flattened, consistent with COPD. Heart size is at the upper
limits of normal with left ventricular configuration. The aorta
is calcified and unfolded. There is no CHF, frank consolidation
or effusion. Again seen is eventration of the left hemidiaphragm
posteriorly. There is probably some associated atelectasis, but
no definite pneumonic infiltrate.

RUQ: Targeted examination was performed. There is small ascites.
Hepatic veins appear patent. The portal vein appears patent with
hepatopetal flow. Hepatic arteries appear patent. No spot marked
for tap.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o F with PBC, decompensated cirrhosis with now presents
with weakness, ARF, hypothermia, and hypotension.
.
HYPOTENSION/HYPOTHERMIA: On admission there was some concern
that the patient was septic given her hypotermia and
hypotension.  She is known to have a low baseline SBP in the
~90's and may have low temp at baseline.  Given her tenuous
state, she was covered empirically with CTX and Flagyl. Naldol
and diuretics were held.  An abdominal U/S was obtained and
showed ascites fluid, but of insufficicent quantity to tap.  Her
CXR and UA were negative for evidence of infection. In light of
the patient's persistent hypotension and hypothermia, patient
was transferred to the ICU where she was started on levophed and
vasopressin.  An abdominal CT was ordered to assess for possible
obstruction and a surgery consult was obtained.  The CT scan
showed diffuse anasarca, ascites, and no convincing evidence of
obstruction although the study was limited 2012-03-24 00:00:00 lack of IV
contrast.  There was also an incidental finding of a new right
posterior rib fracture.  Her clinical condition gradually
improved and she was weaned off pressors on ICU day 4 with a
baseline SBP of 90/50.  CTX and flagyl were d/c'd and patient
was called out to the floor on 2012-03-24 00:00:00.
.
ARF: Patient was found to have a creatinine of 2.1 in the
setting of decreased UO and increased abdominal distention.  Her
urine lytes were consistent with a sodium-avid state, either a
pre-renal etiology or hepatorenal syndrome.  Later labs were
consistent with a ATN vs HRS.  Nephrology was consulted and
agreed with treating with ocreaotide.  Patient was found to have
a Klebsiella UTI, which was treated with a seven day course of
bactrim, and candiduria.  She did receive 2 units of PRBC and
albumin in order to improve her UOP without worsening her
anasarca.  Her creatinine gradually improved and was still
trending down on day of discharge.
.
ABDOMINAL DISTENTION: Initially thought to be 2012-03-24 00:00:00 ascites but
abd U/S showed only a small amount of fluid.  There was no
evidence of obstruction/ileus on CT and patient continued to
pass stool asd flatus.  Transplant surgery was consulted and
patient was made NPO.  Eventually the distention was attributed
to bowel wall edema in the setting of total body anasarca.
Patient was started on lasix and aldactone.
.
BRBPR: Her initial presentation was for painless BRBPR, but her
Hct has remained stable.  In the MICU she had a maroon stool.
NGT was placed and lavage was negative, with stable f/u Hct.
This seemed to be consistent with a lower source such as an AVM,
diverticular bleed, or hemorroids.  Patient underwent an EGD
which showed 1 non-bleeding cord of grade III varices, which was
banded, and no evidence of active bleed. Patient also had a
sigmoidoscopy which showed medium grade 1 hemorroids.
.
PULMONARY: Patient has some very mild hypoxia likely related to
abdominal distention vs cardiac asthma vs reactive airways.  She
maintained her oxygen saturations and did not require
intubation.
.
PPx: Patient maintained of PPI, Lactulose, and pneumoboots for
DVT prophylaxis.
.
DISPO: Patient was discharged home with services in stable
condition with close follow up with her PCP, Adianna Rutledge hepatologist,
and Dr. Rutledge of nephrology.
