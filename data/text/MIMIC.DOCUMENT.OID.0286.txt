changes and small amount of residual/interval hemorrhage. There

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU for close neurological observation.
He was continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. Pre-op
labs/tests were ordered for a right sided craniotomy for 2010-08-18 00:00:00.

On 2010-08-18 00:00:00 he was brought to the operating room and underwent a
right craniotomy and SDH evacuation. Surgery was without
complication. He was admitted to the ICU post op for close
monitoring. A head CT was performed which revealed post
operative changes.

On 2010-08-18 00:00:00 he was neurologically stable. EEG monitoring was
initiated and he was cleared for transfer to the step down unit.
On 2010-08-18 00:00:00 he continued with EEG monitoring.

On 2010-08-18 00:00:00, nursing reported that he aspirated while trying to take
his meds in applesauce therefore he was made NPO.

On 2010-08-18 00:00:00 a routine follow up Head CT was performed as well as
speech and swallow evaluation. Head CT was stable. Speech &
Swallow team deemed that Mr Dogan was unsafe with all
consistencies at this time. An NG tube was placed and he was
started on tube feeds. Nutrition consultation was requested for
assistance with tube feeds.
On 2010-08-18 00:00:00 patient's exam was much improved. He was awake and alert
to self and year. He was following all commands  and interactive
with the examiner.

On 2010-08-18 00:00:00 repeat speech and swallow was performed, but the patient
continued to fail with all consistencies. General Surgery
consultation was requested at this time for PEG placement. The
patient continued on tube feeds in the meantime via his NGtube.
neurological exam continued to improve.

2010-08-18 00:00:00 Pt underwent PEG tube placement with GI team as he was
unable to tolerate a PO diet safely. Pt was noted to be somewhat
more aphasic following this procedure. His ct head was negative
for interval change or new findings at that time. Believing this
could be seizure activity he was given a dose of ativan and his
keppra was increased to 1000mg twice daily. He had had a seizure
prior to his first admission in early 2010-08-18 00:00:00. An EEG obtained on
this admission was consistent with encephalopathic changes. His
sedative medications were discontinued at this time and his
neurontin dose was lowered to 100mg q8.

2010-08-18 00:00:00 Pt found to be febrile and workup was consistent with a RLL
pneumonia on chest x ray. He was started on Vancomycin and zosyn
with a plan for 7 day course. He was later switched to
levofloxacin. His HCT was found to be low on this date and he
was transfused with 2 units of PRBC's. He required no further
transfusions during his stay and his HCT remained in a normal
range.

2010-08-18 00:00:00 Pt was found on the floor face down after he had an
unwitnessed fall from the chair. A head ct was obtained and
showed no acute change in comparrison to 123 Any St.us head ct's. The
pt remained in the hospital overnight for further observation
and is planned for rehab facility on 2010-08-18 00:00:00.
