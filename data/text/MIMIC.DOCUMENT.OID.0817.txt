IMAGING:
2012-11-25 00:00:00 CXR COMPARISON: 2012-11-25 00:00:00.
FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval
increase of bilateral fluffy perihilar and infrahilar opacities
as well as obscured and prominent cardiac silhouette, compatible
with moderate congestive heart failure. There is persistent
opacity involving the cardiophrenic angles.  Supervening
pneumonia and or aspiration cannot be excluded in the
appropriate clinical setting. Small effusions cannot be
excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with moderate congestive heart failure,
with interval worsening since 2012-11-25 00:00:00.
2. Supervening lower lobe infection and/or aspiration cannot be
excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
.
2012-11-25 00:00:00 CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2012-11-25 00:00:00, there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with decreasing pulmonary
vascular
congestion. Confluent lower lobe opacities are consistent with
regions of
pneumonia, especially at the right base.

The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 88 year old male with a history of COPD and diastolic
CHF who is admitted with 1 day of shortness of breath and
intubated in the ED for hypoxia found to have CHF exacerbation
and community acquired pneumonia.
.
# CHF exacerbation:  On admission, patient was in severe
respiratory distress requiring intubation in the ED for hypoxia.
 CXR demonstrated fluid overload.  BNP was elevated only mildly,
to 1530.  Per family and patient, he did not make any diet
changes and was compliant with medications, thus cause of
exacerbation is unclear.  However, he was up 18 lbs from his dry
weight.  ACS was ruled out as a cause of CHF exacerbation with 2
sets of neg cardiac enzymes.  Patient responded well to diuresis
with Lasix 40mg IV and was transitioned to Lasix 40mg PO qd and
finally to home dose of Lasix 20mg PO qd.  On discharge, patient
was at his dry weight of 200 lbs.  Symptom control with
albuterol and ipratroprium nebs.  Continued diltiazem, losartan
for BP control. On discharge, patient was set up with VNA
services as well as telemonitoring for daily weights.
  .
# Pneumonia: On admission, CXR consistent with a bilateral
pneumonia given the fluffy bases which have a slight nodularity.
This could be consistent with a bacterial or viral illness.
However, he did not initially have leukocytosis and his family
denied recent increase in sputum, fevers, muscle aches, or
generalized illness.  Urine legionella was negative.  Patient
was treated for CAP with Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. Patient was
then transitioned to Levofloxacin 750mg PO qd and was discharged
with a prescription to complete a 7 days course of antibiotics.
.
#CAD: Continue statin, ASA for CAD primary prevention
.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): History of
non-compliance with his advair due to costliness and also
trouble getting his oxygen at home.  Continued
albuterol/ipratroprium, advair when extubated.  Because he was
not wheezing on exam and his CXR was more consistent with volume
overload than hyperinflation, the steroids that were started in
the ED were not continued in the ICU.
.
# Chronic kidney disease:  Admission Creatinine was at baseline.

.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DMT2): Maintained on sliding scale.
.
# GERD: Continued PPI
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Tuten,
.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having
difficulty breathing.  We think that you had an exacerbation of
your chronic heart failure.  You were treated by removing fluid
from your lungs with furosemide (lasix) at higher doses than you
take at home.  You also had a breathing tube in to breathe for
you. The tube was removed and you did very well. You were also
found to have a pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics.
You will need to finish taking the antibiotics at home.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
-START Levofloxacin 750mg; take it ONCE on SUNDAY, 2012-11-25 00:00:00
.
It is very important that you keep all of the follow-up
appointments listed below.
.
It is also very importan that you weigh yourself every morning,
Breeonna Tuten MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!
