Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Kamori Neurauter
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of Dobhoff tube
Placement of Arterial line

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M NH resident h/o schizophrenia, CAD, HTN, dementia p/w
hypoxia and FTT from NH. According to the NH records, pt had an
episode of desaturation to mid 80's on RA several days ago. He
came up to 91% on 2L NC. He was also noted to have decreased po
intake, eating only with assistance and only preferred foods.
IVF fluids were given. CXR at NH neg, UA pos. Started on
levaquin 500 mg po on 2013-03-07 00:00:00, also given 1 dose of CTX.
Subsequently, ucx came back as < 10,000 organisms. As patient
continued to be hypotensive and hypoxic, he was transferred to
the UPMCE.

According to NH note, the pt is mostly non-verbal, AAOx1. Pt was
able to nod yes or no in the ED and denied cough, diarrhea. +
SOB, + dizziness. He was unreponsive for other questions. On
evaluation in the ICU he was unresponsive.

In the ED, BP 85/65 initially, then 73/54. Other VS: HR 61, RR
22, O2Sat 100%NRB. He received a total of 2.9L. A foley was
placed and he urinated about 225cc. Pt received empiric
Vancomycin, Levaquin and FLagyl for possible aspiration PNA
although CXR showed no clear consolidation. UA was done and was
negative. An EKG was done an revealed SR, HR 80, NA, loss of RW
in inferior leads, V1, V2 and STE in V2 with overall low
voltage. CE were significant for Trop 0.14, CK 596, MB flat.
Cardiology was called, ekg was faxed: assessment - CE leak
likely demand, EKG with new anteroseptal q's from 2013-03-07 00:00:00 but no
clear ischemic changes currently. Recommended: Serial EKGs,
cycle CEs. Serial EKG showed no change.

CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, a new
Dobbhoff catheter has been inserted. The tip of the catheter
projects over the stomach. However, since the last examination,
a hiatal hernia with subsequent displacement of the part of the
stomach into the thorax becomes manifest. The tip of the
123 Any St.usly positioned nasogastric tube is now projecting into
the thorax. Otherwise, there are no major changes. Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette, subtle retrocardiac atelectasis.
The right basal parts of the lungs are slightly denser than on
the 123 Any St.us radiograph, but without evidence of focal
parenchymal consolidations.

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Q waves in leads V1-V2 suggestive of
prior anterior myocardial infarction. Low limb lead voltage.
Borderline left axis deviation.

Ankle xray: Three radiographs of the left ankle demonstrate
patchy, regional, demineralization about the ankle and foot. The
finding limits assessment for acute fracture or subtle cortical
fragmentation. No acute injury is identified. Osseous remodeling
about the distal metaphyses of the tibia and fibula may
represent the sequela of remote trauma. Assessment for the
presence and/or absence of subcutaneous emphysema is limited by
overlying dressing material. The mortise is congruent. The talar
dome contour is smooth. There is a plantar calcaneal spur.
Vascular calcifications are noted.

ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum
and anterior walls and distal inferior wall. The apex is mildly
aneurysmal and dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

CTA Head and Neck:
IMPRESSION: No acute infarcts and no CT perfusion abnormalities.
Occlusion of the origin and proximal portion of the right
vertebral artery with reconstitution within the mid cervical
portion.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male admitted to the hospital after having
desaturation to the mid-80's on room air, hypotension as well
decreased oral intake.  On admission, the patient was
hypotensive, hypoxic with an elevated white count.  He had an
infectious work up which was unrevealing.  His urinanalysis was
negative, his various pressure sores did not appear infected.
His chest x-ray on admission was negative for acute infection.
He appeared severely dehydrated on exam.  The patient received
intravenous fluids for his decreased hydration as well as for
his hypotension.  He also received antibiotics initially given
his diarrhea and recent antibiotics course while at the nursing
home as well as given his elevated white count.  He also
received one dose of fluconazole for oral thrush which did not
resolve with oral Nystatin.  The patient had an x-ray of his
ankle to evaluate for osteomyelitis underlying his ulcer.  The
xray did not appear consistent with osteomyelitis.

The patient had a NG tube placed for additional nutritional
support while in the hospital.  He received tube feeds while in
the hospital.  He was tolerating softs by mouth prior to
discharge.  His NG tube was discontinued prior to discharge.

He also had both an EKG and echocardiogram which showed evidence
that the patient had a myocardial infarction prior to his
admission to the hospital.  His EKG appears consistent with an
anterior MI.  His ECHO demonstrated normal sized left and right
atrium with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. There was mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum,
anterior walls and distal inferior wall. The apex is mildly
aneurysmal and dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35-40%).

During his hospital course, the patient appeared less responsive
with dysarthria and right sided weakness.  He had a CT scan of
his head and neck vasculature, which is reported above.  The
neurology team was consulted to evaluate the patient.  They felt
he may have had a small TIA.  He was continued on aspirin, an
increased dose of statin and Plavix.  His cholesterol was
checked, which was within normal limits.  He had a hemoglobin
A1C pending at discharge.  His neurological symptoms had
resolved at the time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and

antibiotics for a possible pneumonia and treatment for a
possible gastrointestinal infection.  Both of your antibiotics

It appears you had a small stroke, or TIA while you were in the
hospital.  You have no residual problems from your small stroke.
 We increased your statin.

It appears you may have had a heart attack prior to coming to
