Chief Complaint:
"can't catch my breath after walking 20 feet or even button my
pants!"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis x2


History of Present Illness:
77yo M w/ COPD with interstitial lung disease, pulm HTN, severe
cor pulmonale, and chronic renal disease who p/w worsening SOB,
increasing abdominal girth, and 20 lb wt gain for 2 weeks.

Pt reports feeling exhausted and "terrible." He is becoming
short of breath after walking ~20-25 feet from the bathroom to
the living room, having stop and catch his breath, which is
unusual for him.  At the same time, he was noted to have
increasing weight--a gain of 20 lbs over 2 wks (198 -> 218 lbs).
 Accordingly, he then developed "belly pain" and began having
trouble buttoning his pants over his growing abd.
Because of these increasing symptoms, he was brought to the ED
for further evaluation.

Of note, the pt has had a 123 Any St.itous decline in his functional
status since 2010-06-03 00:00:00 primarily due to symptoms of end-stage cor
pulmonale from his severe pulm disease.  In 2010-06-03 00:00:00, pt developed
similar symptoms of SOB, abd distension, and wt gain and was
hospitalized at UPMCE for a total of 12 days.

Pt otherwise denies fever/chills, chest pain, palpitations,
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, headache/dizziness, or incontinence.

Echocardiography 2010-06-03 00:00:00 at 2:01:13 PM
The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Normal left ventricular systolic function. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no
mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis
with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. Severe pulmonary hypertension. No
evidence of intracardiac shunt.

SINGLE AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is a right
lower lobe opacity in comparison with multiple prior studies,
likely represents epicardial fat exaggerated by lordotic
technique and patient rotation. With the exception of this,
there are no focal consolidations. There is no pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
enlarged, stable. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Study Date of 2010-06-03 00:00:00 9:00 AM
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver echotexture is
normal. There is
no focal liver lesion or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The main
portal vein is patent with the appropriate direction of flow,
though flow is noted to be pulsatile. The heparic veins are also
dilated.

The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones. The common
duct is not dilated, measuring 2 mm. The pancreas is not
visualized. The spleen is normal in size, measuring 8.5 cm. A
moderate to large amount of ascites is seen in all quadrants.

IMPRESSION: Probable passive hepatic congestion related to
right-sided heart failure, particularly in light of relatively
pulsatile blood flow in the portal vein. Normal liver
echotexture and spleen size. Large amount of
ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Barrera is a 77 year-old male with COPD/interstitial lung
disease, pulmonary hypertension, severe cor pulmonale, and
chronic kidney disease who presented with exacerbation of cor
pulmonale, worsening SOB and 20 lb wt gain.

In the Abriele Barrera, pt experienced hematemesis x 2. O2 sat of 80s on 4L
NC and then 94-96% on NRB. Pt was placed on Bipap 10/5 and
received 40 mg IV Lasix x 2. Lactate was 3.1 on admission, BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 1555**], Trop slightly above baseline of 0.02 to 0.04. Pt was
initially admitted to Medicine UPMCE for further treatment of his
R-sided HF.  On arrival to the medical UPMCE, the patient was
hypoxic w/ O2 sats in low 70s, BP 131/86, dyspneic at RR 44,
tachy w/ HR of 92, as well as vomited 50cc of bloody contents
upon arrival to the floor. He transferred to the MICU for
further monitoring and management.

In the MICU, pt was gently diuresed w/ IV Lasix.  A 4L
paracentesis was performed.  He became hypotensive (BP into the
70s-80s systolic) following the paracentesis.  For this, he
received total of 75g albumin over 2 days. Once patient's vitals
stabilized, he was transferred to the floor for further
management.

On the General Medicine floor, the following issues were managed
as described below.
## Pulmonary fibrosis:
Pt has severe interstitial pulmonary disease refractory to
treatment.  It has led to severe pulmonary hypertension and
end-stage cor-pulmonale.  He requires Given prior side effects
of hypotension, tachycardia, and dizziness with a trial of
sildenafil in the past (2010-06-03 00:00:00), no sildenafil was attempted
during this hospital stay.  Patient was maintained on prn
inhalers and continued on oxygen regimen increased from home
dose of 4L.  Patient was also placed on CPAP overnight.
Continued outpatient pulmonary follow-up with Dr. Barrera will
be needed.

## Cor pulmonale:
Chronic.  Echo shows severe right ventricular dilation and
hypokenesis w/ severe tricuspid regurgitation, as well as right
ventricular pressure/volume overload.  This is thought to be
secondary to severe pulmonary fibrosis/pulmonary hypertension.
There is no evidence of intracardiac shunt on echo.
His right ventricular failure has led to hepatic congestion ->
ascites -> b/l LE edema.  He was treated with aggressive
diuresis as well as paracentesis x2.  Net total weight/fluid
loss at the end of the hospital stay was approximately 20 lbs.
Discharge weight 87kg (day prior had been 92kg, before 2L
paracentesis).
Patient was discharged with Lasix 80 mg PO BID with increased
oxygen requirement at 5L NC satting between 90-94%.  He goal 02
sat is >93%.

## Hypotension:
Pt is relatively hypotensive at baseline with SBP typically
90-110.  However, following his first paracentesis of 4L his BP
did drop into the 70s-80s.  He remained asymptomatic despite
this drop in blood pressure.  His blood pressure responded to
albumin.  Of note, he underwent a 2nd therapeutic paracentesis
of 2L and his blood pressure tolerated the lower volume tap.

## Chylous ascites: The fluid was chylous in nature w/ high
TG's.  The cause of ascites secondary to hepatic congestion
related to RH failure.
Abdomen remained significantly protuberant with dramatic fluid
wave on exam despite paracentesis.  Patient received therapeutic
paracentesis x 2.

## Hematemesis:
Patient had episode of hematemesis on admission, though no
subsequent episodes.  He was evaluated by the GI service.  EGD
was discussed but the patient preferred to hold on the procedure
since there was no recurrence of following admission.  His HCT
remained relatively stable in the low to mid-30s.  Given no
further evidence of bleend and the patient's request to decrease
the number of pills taken daily, Protonix was discontinued
during the latter half of the hospitalization.

## LV diastolic HF:  Echo showed 55% LV systolic function.

## Insomnia:
Patient initially complained of insomnia, which was treated with
home dose of 10 mg PO Ambien.

## Hypothyroidism:
Clinically stable with complaints of cold intolerance but no
other symptoms or signs of hypothyroidism.  Patient was
maintained on home dose of levothyroxine.
