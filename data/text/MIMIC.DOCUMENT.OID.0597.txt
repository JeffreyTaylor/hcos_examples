HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Dohrman is a 76-year-old man
with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary
artery disease (status post inferior myocardial infarction
with ventricular fibrillation arrest in 2009-08-15 00:00:00) who has done
well with only six episodes of exertional angina until then.

Three days ago, the patient woke up at 3:00 a.m. with severe
midsternal chest pain radiating to the left arm.  It was
similar to the symptoms of his prior myocardial infarction.
It was not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
shortness of breath.

The patient presented to UPMCE Hospital within one half
hour of the onset of the pain where he was treated with
sublingual nitroglycerin, oxygen, morphine, and heparin.  The
patient became pain free and remained so for the remainder of
his hospitalization.  The patient ruled in for a myocardial
infarction with a positive troponin level of 2.87 and a
creatine kinase of 426.

Cardiac catheterization performed on the day prior to
admission at UPMCE Hospital demonstrated a small LIMA,
total occlusion of the SVG to OM,  and diseased segments of
the SVG to diagonal to obtuse marginal.  The ejection
fraction was normal.  The LV end-diastolic pressure was 19,
right atrial pressure was 13, and pulmonary artery pressure
33/10.

The patient was transported to UPMCE on the day of admission where he underwent stenting of
the saphenous vein graft to diagonal and obtuse marginal with
a PercuSurge distal protection device.  The patient
experienced his typical anginal symptoms during the procedure
and for approximately one hour status post procedure.

The patient denied a history of shortness of breath, dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or presyncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction
   times two.
2. Hypertension.
3. Dyslipidemia.
4. Osteoarthritis.
5. Question of sleep apnea.
6. Lower extremity claudication.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
his blood pressure was 100 to 110/60, his heart rate was 40
to 50 (without ectopy), and he was saturating 100 percent on
room air.  Neck revealed no jugular venous distention.  The
lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Heart revealed
distant first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  A 2009-08-15 00:00:00
apical murmur.  There was a sternotomy scar.  A right groin
arterial sheath in situ with positive ecchymosis.  No
hematoma or ooze.  The distal pulses were intact on
extremities.  The feet were cool bilaterally.  There were no
edema.  There was a left lower extremity saphenous vein graft
harvest scar.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 7.2, his hematocrit was 40.7, and his
platelets were 187.  His blood urea nitrogen was 20 and his
creatinine was 1.1.  Cholesterol was 154, his high-density
lipoprotein was 30, and his low-density lipoprotein was 90.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed
sinus bradycardia with a rate in the 50s.  There were small Q
waves and ST-T wave sloping in III and aVF.  There was a 1-mm
ST segment depressions in V2 through V4.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, the patient was
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for stenting
procedure.  He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory.  The patient complained of persistent chest pain
where he had three stents placed.  Then the patient dropped
his blood pressure significantly in the SVG to first diagonal
to first obtuse marginal jump graft  90's with prominent ST
depressions in V1, two hepicoat stents mid and distally, one
cypher in the ostium.  At this time a thrombus was discovered
at the site of intervention and distal stent was occluded.

Post procedure, the patient developed recurrent angina with
more prominent ST depressions in V1 through V4, ST elevations
in I and aVL, with a decrease in blood pressures to systolics
in the 90s when the nitroglycerin drip was increased.

The patient was taken back to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory where a thrombus was found at the site of
intervention, and the distal stent was occluded.  The patient
underwent angioplasty with two stent placements distally and
administration of Integrelin, clopidogrel, and intracoronary
TPA.  An intraaortic balloon pump was placed to maximize
coronary blood flow.

After this procedure the patient did well and was able to be
weaned off the balloon pump.  The patient was continued on
aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, Plavix, and statin.
The patient did develop a moderate retroperitoneal hematoma
requiring a transfusion of blood, though this was stable.  In
addition, the patient had episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia for which he will follow up with
Electrophysiology for further risk stratification.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease; status post non-ST-elevation
   myocardial infarction with subacute stent occlusion.
2. Retroperitoneal hematoma.


MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Nitroglycerin 0.3-mg sublingual tablets as needed.
4. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.
6. Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7. Multivitamin by mouth every day.
8. Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.



DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:
1. The patient was to follow up with Dr. Cordis Hodny (his
   cardiologist) who will arrange for signal-averaged EKG and
   exercise T wave alternate study.
2. The patient was to follow up with Dr. Cordis Hodny when
   these studies are completed.
3. The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary
   care doctor (Dr. Cordis Hodny Dohrman) within one month.
