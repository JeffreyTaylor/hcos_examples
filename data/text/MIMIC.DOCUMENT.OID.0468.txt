Service:  VSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 83-year-old,
Russian only speaking female admitted due to likely
cellulitis of her right above the knee amputation stump.  Her
history was limited by absence of a family member or
translator at the time of interview, and the remainder of her
history was obtained from her medical record.

Past medical history includes coronary artery disease, status
post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent
in 2013-02-04 00:00:00, coronary artery bypass graft in 2013-02-04 00:00:00,
cerebrovascular accident in 2013-02-04 00:00:00, right medullary
cardiovascular accident in 2013-02-04 00:00:00, seizure disorder,
diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, carotid artery
stenosis, renal artery stenosis status post stent placement
in the left renal artery, recurrent urinary tract infection,
severe depression status post ECT therapy, left femoral neck
fracture, right groin hematoma, recurrent urinary tract
infections, peripheral vascular disease.

Past surgical history includes repair of a ruptured infected
right femoral pseudo aneurysm, coronary artery bypass graft,
right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass graft
with a PTFE and distal talar vein patch in 2013-02-04 00:00:00 by Dr.
Beutler, left closed reduction internal fixation of the left
hip fracture, and evacuation of right groin hematoma.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient does not drink alcohol.  She does
not smoke cigarettes.  She has a son and daughter-in-law and
daughter who are involved in her care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 70, blood
pressure 118/74, sating 96 percent on room air.  In general,
the patient was alert, in no acute distress.  She has slight
scleral icterus and some sublingual icterus.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, obese; positive
bowel sounds.  She has a bluish tinge periumbilically.
Extremities, particularly the left lower extremity, show 2 to
3 plus pitting edema.  Pulses right femoral is 2 plus, left
femoral 2 plus, popliteal 1 plus, DP triphasic, PT triphasic.

PERTINENT RESULTS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell
count 9.3 with 73 percent neutrophils.  Creatinine of 1.5.
CT of the legs showed skin thickening and subcutaneous
stranding in the medial thigh corresponding to physical exam
without underlying abscess, similar skin thickening and
pronounced subcutaneous stranding and extensive soft tissue
attenuation surrounding the prosthetic graft in the anterior
lateral thigh also suspicious for infection, mottled and
demineralized appearance of the femur likely related to
disease.

Medications on admission include nifedipine 30 mg p.o. once
daily, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., atorvastatin 20 mg p.o.
once daily, glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o.
once daily, valsartan 80 mg p.o. once daily, levofloxacin 250
mg p.o. once daily, buspirone 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., bupropion
150 mg p.o. b.i.d., multivitamin 1 cap p.o. once daily,
acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg p.o. q. 2013-02-04 00:00:00 p.r.n., lorazepam at
1.5 mg p.o. at bedtime, vancomycin 1 gm IV q. 48h., Flagyl
500 mg p.o. t.i.d., heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.

Patient was admitted on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 and was continued on IV
vancomycin and levofloxacin for presumed right above the knee
amputation stump infection.  She was also evaluated for heart
failure causing the peripheral edema.  During the patient's
stay she had considerable difficulty receiving blood pressure
control.  This required multiple medication maneuvers.

She was taken on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 to the Operating Room for an I
and D of the infected leg and removal of her right thigh
graft, which she tolerated well.  Renal function was a
concern, however, afterwards and her chronic renal
insufficiency with acute exacerbation required monitoring.
Postoperatively, she continued to receive her IV antibiotics
and did receive a PICC line for easier administration.  Also
postoperatively, the patient was seen by Psychiatry both for
treatment of her severe depression as well as acute mental
status exacerbations and need for a one-to-one sitter.

After a couple days of dressing changes soaked in acetic
acid, the patient's leg wound had a VAC dressing placed,
which worked well for healing purposes.

On postoperative day 3 the patient did experience a fever and
received a fever workup.  Her chest x-ray did not have any
CHF or pneumonia.  She also had blood and urine cultures
performed.  During her stay the patient did require blood
transfusion which did cause a degree of heart failure and the
need for Lasix.  Cardiac service was made involved at that
time because during her blood transfusion her systolic blood
pressure decreased and the patient went into a junctional
escape rhythm requiring telemetry and close observation.
However, the patient did spontaneously convert back to sinus
rhythm.  The cardiac service made recommendations to hold
beta blockers as well as began to make plans for possible
pacer placement.

On the morning of 2013-02-04 00:00:00 the patient was noted on
telemetry to acutely brady down to asystole.  She was
emergently coded, requiring artificial respiration and chest
compressions.  She was shocked a number of times as well as
received a number of cardiac inotropic medications.  Patient
was successfully revived and was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further care.  She was, at that time, seen by
the Electrophysiology Department, who then placed a cardiac
pacemaker.  While in the ICU the patient never truly woke up
from a neurological standpoint, although she would turn her
head to the left and withdraw her left leg to pain.  She
never truly regained consciousness.  She was started on tube
feeds.  She did require IV blood pressure management and
drips for severe hypertension.  She did remain vent dependent
after resuscitation in the ICU, and finally on 2013-02-04 00:00:00 the
patient was made comfort measures only by the family.
Patient's ventilatory support was removed and by the evening
of 2013-02-04 00:00:00 at 9:55 p.m. the patient expired with no blood
pressure and no respiratory effort.  Patient's family has
been contactCarmon Beutler to alert them of the passing, and they do not
wish an autopsy to be performed.  She will be discharged to
the funeral home.
