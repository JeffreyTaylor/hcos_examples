Chief Complaint:
Left non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in 6/2010-07-30 00:00:00.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2010-07-30 00:00:00: bronchoscopy and mediastonoscopy
2010-07-30 00:00:00: LUL segmentectomy, LLL wedge resection


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Spuhler is a 77-year-old gentleman, referred by Dr. Gwena Hopely
Spuhler to Dr. Gwena Hopely for advice and options regarding a
carcinoma of the lung detected during recent hospitalization for
coronary disease and a large aortic aneurysm in 2010-07-30 00:00:00. A
lesion in the left lung was discovered in the upper lobe and a
needle biopsy confirmed non-small cell carcinoma.  He underwent
a PET scan, which showed extreme hypermetabolism with an SUV of
17 at the site of the lung primary lesion.  There is sparse
uptake within the mediastinum, not considered of pathologic
significance, as well as active inflammation around the
abdominal graft.

He presented to UPMCE on 2010-07-30 00:00:00 for an operation to address his
left non-small cell lung cancer.


Past Medical History:
Significant for coronary disease, status
post an infarction.  He has aortic aneurysm, increased serum
cholesterol, prostate cancer, and carcinoma of the sigmoid
colon.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Sigmoid colectomy in 2010-07-30 00:00:00, radical
prostatectomy in 2010-07-30 00:00:00, and the tube graft repair of his
abdominal
aortic aneurysm.


Social History:
He has substantial prior smoking history, just recently quit.
He has no active alcohol issues.


Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight of 148 pounds.  He is afebrile, blood
pressure 140/83, pulse 74 and regular, and room air saturation
is
95%.
LUNGS:  His lung fields are surprisingly clear.
HEART:  Regular rhythm and rate without murmur or gallop.
NECK:  There were no carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good healing ridge along the
wound.
EXTREMITIES:  He has no peripheral edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to UPMCE on the day of planned surgery.
He was noted to have significant bradycardia prior to starting
the operation.  He did undergo a flexible bronchoscopy and
mediastinoscopy that was complicated by substantial
intraoperative bleeding.  He was subsequently ruled out for a
cardiac event, and remained
hemodynamically and neurologically stable on POD#1. On HD#3, the
decision was made to proceed with a segmental resection given
the T2 size of the lesion and his limited baseline lung
function. Please refer to both operative notes of 2010-07-30 00:00:00 and
2010-07-30 00:00:00 for further details of the procedures. An epidural was
placed for postoperative pain control on 2010-07-30 00:00:00. Two left-sided
chest tubes were placed intraoperatively, and a post-operative
chest radiograph showed a moderate left sided pneumothorax.

On 2010-07-30 00:00:00, he was transfused 1 unit of packed RBCs for a
hemtocrit of 27.6. The Acute Pain Service continued to follow
the patient for management of the epidural catheter. He was
admitted to the CSRU for a day after surgery and was transferred
to the floor on 2010-07-30 00:00:00 after he was deemed to be stable. His chest
tubes were placed to water seal, and a chest radiograph showed
very slight increase in left pneomothorax.

On 2010-07-30 00:00:00, his anterior chest tube which was placed
intraoperatively was removed without incident, and his second
tube was put to bulb suction. A chest radiograph that was done
after these changes were made showed no acute or concerning
changes in the left pneumothorax. His epidural catheter was
removed and he was given oral pain medications.

On 2010-07-30 00:00:00, the patient's foley catheter was discontinued, but the
patient failed to void 12 hours after removal. He was
administered tamsulosin and his foley catheter was replaced. A
PA and lateral chest radiograph showed decreased left-sided
pneumothorax and interstitial edema since the prior examination,
with small bilateral pleural effusions.

On 2010-07-30 00:00:00, he underwent a video swallow study which revealed a
left vocal cord paralysis. The speech consultant recommended the
following:
1.  Diet of thin liquids and soft solids
2. Swallow w/chin tucked to chest for all consistencies
3.  Pills whole in applesauce
4.  ENT consult to evaluate vocal cord mobility to r/o Left
    vocal cord paresis/paralysis

An otolaryngology consult was obtained for evaluation and
treatment for this condition, the recommendation which were to
observe strict chin-tuck adherence and strict aspiration
precautions as the patient was thought to be at great aspiration
risk; and twice-daily proton pump inhibitor. A chest radiograph
performed on 2010-07-30 00:00:00 showed further improvement in the small
left apical pneumothorax and improvement in the interstitial
edema.

On 2010-07-30 00:00:00, he underwent another voiding trial after his foley
was discontinued, and this time, he voided 500cc. The patient
was discharged to rehabilitation facility in good condition,
with instructions for follow-up care with thoracic surgeon, Dr.
Gwena Hopely, and otolaryngologist, Dr. Gwena Hopely.
