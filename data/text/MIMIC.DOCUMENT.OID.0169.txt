Service:  MEDICAL ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Noblin is an 80 year-old
female with a past medical history significant for dementia
presents as a transfer from HCRA with fevers and hypotension.
Per available information the patient was in her usual state
of health until 9:30 in the morning of 2005-05-23 00:00:00 when she
spiked a temperature to 104.  She was seen by Effrey Noblin cover MD
and found to be bradycardic.  A few hours later the patient
was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in
the 50s.  She was unresponsive.  She was bolused 500 cc of
normal saline without a change in blood pressure and was
transferred to the UPMCE
Emergency Department at that point.

Initial vital signs in the Emergency Room were temperature
100.8.  Blood pressure 54/27 with a pulse of 88.
Respirations 28 with an O2 saturation of 91% on room air
increasing to 99% on 10 liters.  She received 4 liters of
intravenous fluids, antibiotics were started Ampicillin,
Gentamycin and Flagyl and a left subclavian triple lumen
catheter was placed.  Physical examination was
noncontributory initially.  Initial laboratories were notable
for a white blood cell count of 10.9 with a bandemia.
Urinalysis was very concentrated and multiple white blood
cells.  Despite intravenous fluids systolic blood pressure
remained low and she was started on a dopamine drip titrated
to 15 mcs per minute and systolic blood pressure was
maintained in the low 100s.  At that point the patient was
transferred to the MICU for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Dementia.  2.  Hypertension.  3.
Glaucoma.  4.  Coronary artery disease.  5.  Ischemic
cardiomyopathy with EF of 40%.  6.  PEG tube.  7.  Paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone.  8.  Type 2 diabetes.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Sorbitol 30 mg po q day, Amiodarone
200 mg po q day, vitamin C 500 units po q day, aspirin 81 mg
po q day, multivitamin q day, Axid 150 mg po q day, Risperdal
10 mg po b.i.d. and zinc 220 mg po q day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile 97.9.  Heart rate 99.  Blood
pressure 84/43.  O2 sat 99% on nonrebreather.  Generally, was
unresponsive to oral stimuli or to sternal rub.  Of note,the
patient is Russian speaking only.  HEENT pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.
Neck veins were flat.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart was tachycardic with distant heart
sounds, 2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities mild pedal edema.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 10.9, hematocrit 34.4,
platelet count of 214, INR 2.0, sodium 147, creatinine 2.0,
anion gap of 14.  Her differential showed 62 polys and 20
bands.  Urinalysis was cloudy, specific gravity of 1.015, pH
of 8.5, large blood, positive nitrite, greater then 300
protein, large leukocyte esterase, greater then 50 white
blood cells and red blood cells with many bacteria.  Chest
x-ray showed diffuse left sided infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram was sinus at 100 with normal axis and
intervals, ___________________ voltage with nonspecific T
diffuse T wave inversions and 1 to 123 Any St. depressions, T
wave inversions in V2 to V5.  Blood and urine cultures were
sent at that point.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was presumed to have urosepsis
initially managed on Dopamine and Levophed drips.  She had
intermittent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone
requiring at one point Diltiazem drip.  She was successfully
weaned from her Dopamine and Levophed drips on hospital day
four.  She was presumed to have aspiration pneumonitis versus
pneumonia and acute lung injury.  During intubation and was
initially managed with Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and
Ceftazidime.  Her antibiotics regimen were switched around
several times when she would intermittently spike
temperatures with no obvious source.  She was extremely slow
to wean from the vent despite the aggressive pulmonary
toilet, chest physical therapy and broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Of note, the patient's urine initially grew
Providencia stuartii E and proteus mirabilis and she grew
proteus mirabilis as well in her blood.  On 2005-05-23 00:00:00 also had
coag negative staph in her blood, which was the rational for
the Ceptaz and Vancomycin and Levofloxacin initially.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative on 2005-05-23 00:00:00 and 2005-05-23 00:00:00.
She completed a course for her urinary tract infection.
Ceftazidime was subsequently stopped.  However, she was
febrile on 2005-05-23 00:00:00.  Sputum showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa again.
The patient was subsequently restarted on Ceftazidime, which
was later switched to Piperacillin and Tazobactam.

At the time of discharge the patient had completed nineteen
days of Levofloxacin and was on day eight of her third round
of her Vancomycin and Zosyn.  Her central lines were changed
on multiple occasions.  She had a PICC line placed on 2005-05-23 00:00:00.
Given her slow wean off of pressors and intermittent
hypotensive episodes the patient had Noblin stem test on 2005-05-23 00:00:00,
which was performed according to regular protocol and it
showed an inappropriate Cortisol response to ACTH infusion.
Her baseline Cortisol was 18 and a one hour Cortisol level
was measured at 18.  She was therefore started on Prednisone
5 mg po q day as replacement therapy.  She may at some point
require mineral corticoid supplementation.  However, elected
not to add Florinef at this time.

The patient was very slow to wean from the vent given her
continued diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and adult respiratory
distress syndrome type picture.  She was trached on 2005-05-23 00:00:00
without complications.  She was maintained on assist control
ventilation, however, her PEEP was successfully weaned from
15 to 5 and her FIO2 was weaned from 0.6 to 0.4.  The patient
tolerated that with O2 saturations in the high 90s.  The
patient did continue to spike low grade temperatures.  Her
line sites looked clean and had a PICC line placed on 2005-05-23 00:00:00.
She did have twelve hours of increased stool output while on
broad spectrum antibiotics, therefore C-diff was sent.  The
first C-diff was pending at the time of discharge.  Her
active issues upon discharge include:

1.  Pulmonary, the patient continues to have diffuse
bilateral infiltrates presumed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
and resolving acute lung injury/pneumonia.  She will be
discharged on Vancomycin day eight of fourteen, Piperacillin
and Tazobactam day eight of fourteen and Levofloxacin day
nineteen.  She will require aggressive pulmonary toilet and
is currently being suctioned more overnight, but generally
every two to three hours.  She currently is on assist control
450 by 20 breathing at 26 with a PEEP of 5 and an FIO2 of 0.4
maintaining O2 sats in the high 90s.  She continues to
auto diurese and generally is more awake and interactive.
She will most likely be a very slow wean and may not be
possible to decannulate her trach

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient continues to hve
intermittent low grade temperature spikes with no obvious
source.  Her cultures remain negative at this point.  She
should receive two more C-diff toxins upon reaching the rehab
facility and po Flagyl should be added to her nasogastric
tube should she come back positive.  At this point her stool
output has decreased and she has been afebrile for greater
then 24 hours at the time of discharge.  She should complete
a fourteen day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin and
Tazobactam.  Dosages are listed at the end of this dictation.
I would continue the Levofloxacin for the remaining six days
and stop all antibiotics at that point.  Should she spike she
should be recultured for sources, although I feel that her
intermittent temperature spike was likely related to her
pulmonary disease.

3.  Cardiovascular/atrial fibrillation:  The patient has
intermittent atrial fibrillation currently in normal sinus
rhythm.  She responds very well to Diltiazem should she have
recurrent atrial fibrillation.  There is no plan to
anticoagulate the patient at this time despite her risk of
stroke given her multiple comorbidities.

4.  FEN:  Our goal ins and outs at this point are even to
slightly negative.  The patient continues to auto diurese and
generally line status is euvolemic to slightly positive.
Continue to follow her electrolytes and replete.  She is
currently on tube feeds and at goal with minimal residuals.
She has a PICC line, which was placed on 2005-05-23 00:00:00, which is
functioning well and the site looks clean.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.
3.  Urinary tract infection.
4.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
5.  Dementia.
6.  Respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy placement.

DISPOSITION:  UPMCE.
