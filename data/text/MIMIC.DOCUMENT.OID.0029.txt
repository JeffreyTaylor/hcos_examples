Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH abuse, chronic pancreatitis, who presented
with signs and symptoms of ETOH withdrawal

1. ETOH w/d: Presented with tachycardia, hallucinations,
tremulousness. Given 40mg Valium in ED. Admitted to UPMCE and
started on valium CIWA scale. Started on Folate, Thiamine, MVI.
Monitored on telemetry overnight. He had no evidence of seizure
or HD instabilitiy o/n. His CIWA was 2014-06-01 00:00:00, mainly based on
agitation and tremulousness, and he recieved an additional 120mg
valium overnight. Early on HD 2 the patient demanded to leave.
It was explained to the patient that he has a high probability
of withdrawal seizure or DT's and that he needed continued ICU
monitoring. The patient reported that he understood this but
still wished to leave against medical advice. He was felt to
have capacity to make this decision since he had no evidence of
delirium and clearly understood his situation and risks
involved. The case was discussed with the on call psychiatry
resident, ICU medicine resident and ICU staff attending.
Therefore the patient signed out AMA on hospital day 2. Prior to
discharge we did have him ambulate around the intensive care
unit and he was able to do this without too much difficuluty,
although he was still a bit tremulous upon discharge. He had no
other evidence of active w/d symptoms.

2. Anion-gap Acidosis: Suspected secondary to ketoacidosis,
likely from poor PO intake. ETOH was negative suggesting against
ETOH related cause. Serum acetone was positive, with a normal
serum osm. His gap closed with IVF hydration.

3. Hypochloremic Metabolic Alkalosis: Secondary to HCL loss from
vomiting. Improved with IVF hydration.

4. Hematemesis: Limited hematemesis early the morning of
admission. He had no further episodes of blood loss and he was
guaiac negative on admission. Hematocrit remained stable
overnight.

5. Abd pain: Suspect secondary to chronic pancreatitis.
Amylase/Lipase unchanged from 123 Any St.us levels. AST/ALT 2:1 in
setting of h/o ETOH abuse. Recent CT (2014-06-01 00:00:00) negative for liver
or GB dx, only fatty liver.

6. RLL lung mass: Seen on Chest CT from 2014-06-01 00:00:00, concerning for
primary lung CA. Has not been worked up further. Not able to set
up follow-up as patient left AMA.
