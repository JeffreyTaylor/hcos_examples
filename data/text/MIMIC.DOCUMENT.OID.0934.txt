History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 yo recently diagnosed with Lesliann Orsag syndrome
(transformation of CLL to large B cell NHL) now s/p 3 cycles of
CHOP presents with PNA diagnosed at UPMCE ED.  The pt is
now referred from UPMCE clinic for treatment of PNA.  The pt
presented to OSH ED on 2012-05-10 00:00:00 and was diagnosed with LLL PNA and
was given a course of levofloxacin.  The pt did not take his abx
as prescribed.  He c/o increased SOB, DOE, and cough x 1 week.
The pt also c/o decrease a123 Any St.e over past week with 4 lb
weight loss.  No increase in fatigue.  No f/c/s, n/v, d/c,
abdominal pain, chest pain, or pain with inspiration.

.
Onc History:
subcarinal LAD noted on bronchscopy in 2012-05-10 00:00:00 which was negative
for malignant cells. Referred by Dr. Auryn to heme onc for
enlarged lower lobe lung mass. Mediastinoscopy was performed in
2012-05-10 00:00:00 which was suggestive of atypical chronic lymphocytic
leukemia.  Lung biopsy performed revealed a large Bcell NHL. The
probable basis for his problem is understood to be
transformation of CLL to a Lesliann Orsag syndrome. s/p 3 cycles of
CHOP
.
Lymph Node bx 2012-05-10 00:00:00:
Immunophenotypic findings are of involvement by a
lambda-restricted CD5 positive B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorder.  The differential diagnosis includes an atypical
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (with subset loss of CD23).
.
CT 2012-05-10 00:00:00:
1.  Unchanged size of left lower lung lobe mass measuring
approximately 7.4 cm in greatest axial dimension.  This mass has
decreased attenuation when compared with the prior exam which
may be secondary to chemotherapy treatment and necrosis.  Small
pulmonary nodules in the lower lobes bilaterally are unchanged.

CXR:
AP AND LATERAL CHEST: The heart size is normal. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous without focal dilatation. There has been
interval worsening of right upper lobe, left upper lobe, and
left retrocardiac airspace opacities consistent with multifocal
pneumonia. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is a
likely small left pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Worsening of the multifocal pneumonia.
.
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in patchy ground glass opacities
bilaterally, predominantly in the upper lungs, consistent with
worsening multifocal pneumonia.
2. Unchanged appearance of tree-in-Auryn Spaeth opacities in the right
middle and lower lungs, consistent with infection.
3. Unchanged appearance of left lower lung mass.

2012-05-10 00:00:00 CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 2012-05-10 00:00:00 and 21. Severe
consolidation in the left lung and in the right lung apex more
significantly since 2012-05-10 00:00:00. Pleural effusion, moderate on the
left and small on the right is stable. Heart size top normal.
Findings could represent worsening of either asymmetric
pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: Briefly pt is a 79 M with Lesliann Orsag syndrome
(transformation of CLL to large B cell NHL) s/p 3 cycles of CHOP
who originally presented here for multifocal PN on 2012-05-10 00:00:00 and
started on levofloxacin. On the evening of 2012-05-10 00:00:00 pt with irreg
tachy - ? MAT. Pt then became hypoxic on NRB and CXR w/
worsening multifocal infiltrates. CTA r/o'd PE. Treated w/
Vanc/Zosyn. Pt temporarily on heparin gtt and had 9pt HCT drop.
He was tx'd 2 units pRBC, remained in resp distress, developed
RVR, flash pulm edema, and was intubated. His Tpn peaked at
0.44. TTE revealed EF 25%. Bronchoscopy on 2012-05-10 00:00:00 neg. Pt was
started on metoprolol/captopril and extubated.
.
He was tx'd to OMED svc. Again decompensated with RVR and
required NRB by 2012-05-10 00:00:00. He also developed diarrhea, a rising WBC,
and a lactate up to 5.7. He was tx'd back to the ICU for hypoxic
respiratory failure and intubated. He was treated with flagyl
for c dif despite negative toxins, levoflox for atypical
coverage, Spaeth and vanco to complete a course of antibiotics. He
was noted to have an NSTEMI on 2012-05-10 00:00:00 with peak MB 64 and Trop
1.08. His volume status was managed, he was aggressively
suctioned and extubated with a plan for no reintubation after
extensive discussion with the family and pt's son and HCP(ie:
DNR/DNI).
.
He returned to the OMED service on 2012-05-10 00:00:00 where there was
apparently another conversation regarding code status during
which the pt requested to be Full Code, though his family felt
that he was confused and did not understand the meaning of the
conversation. His son Auryn Spaeth and daughter continued to request
that he be DNR/DNI and felt that this was in keeping with his
desires. On the BMT unit, the patient was initiated on TPN. He
was also noted to have another increase in CE's 2012-05-10 00:00:00 with a MB
30 and Trop 1.123 Any St. elevations on EKG. He received lasix
20mg x 3 over the day of 2012-05-10 00:00:00 to maintain negative fluid
balance. He became tachypneic and desaturated to an O2 sat of
79% on RA. His HR was 106. He was started on NRB and ABG showed
7.36/33/63 and his sats on NRB ranged from 90-94%. He was also
given 40 mg IV lasix and pt had 60 cc foley output. CXR
confirmed worsening CHF.
.
ICU was called for transfer given his tachypnea, hypoxia, and
increased work of breathing. The patient's PCP, Spaeth. Auryn, who
was involved in the code discussions (Dr. Auryn was Auryn
and felt the pt should remain DNR/DNI. The pt's son was also
Auryn Spaeth and felt very strongly that the patient should be
DNR/DNI. Auryn Spaeth sister was also called because she was
present during the daytime today when code status was changed
and confirmed that the patient was confused today, answered only
"yes" to questions, and did not clearly state his desires when
asked. Prior to transfer to ICU, the patient was confused and in
respiratory distress and did not reliably answer questions. He
was transfered to the ICU for further monitoring.
.
In the ICU, the pt's code status remained DNR/DNI.  Family and
PCP were Auryn Spaeth.  The pt continued to deteriorate and goals
of care were turned to comfort primarily.  He died comfortably.
