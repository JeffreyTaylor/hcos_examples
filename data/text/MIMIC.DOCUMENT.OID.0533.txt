MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Levofloxacin 250 mg po q 48 hours.
2.  Flagyl 500 t.i.d.
3.  Colace.
4.  Senna tabs.
5.  Protonix.
6.  Zolpidem 5 mg q.d.
7.  Sevelamer 800 mg t.i.d.
8.  Nephrocaps one q.d.
9.  Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.
10.  Coumadin 1 mg q.d.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  CBC with a white blood cell count of
6.9, poly 72, lymphocytes 18, hematocrit 33, platelets 255,
BUN 9, creatinine 3.4, K 3.5.  Echocardiogram done in
2008-05-01 00:00:00 showed normal ejection fraction with mitral
regurgitation and aortic regurgitation noted.

The patient was begun on Vanco, Levo and Flagyl antibiotics.
Coumadin was continued.  Protonix was continued and vascular
was consulted regarding management.  Vascular examination
showed a pleasant male in no acute distress.  HEENT
examination was unremarkable.  carotids were without bruits.
Heart was a regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were
diminished at the right base and abdominal examination had a
palpable aortic aneurysm.  The foot examination showed a left
foot cold with ischemic appearing black ulceration on the
left medial heel and ankle with no erythema, fluctuance or
drainage.  The pulse examination showed palpable femorals on
the right, dopplerable on the left.  Popliteal was
dopplerable on the right, absent on the left.  The dorsalis
pedis pulses were absent bilaterally.  The patient PT was
dopplerable on the right and absent on the left.  The foot
x-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.  Arteriogram on
2008-05-01 00:00:00 showed a abdominal aortic aneurysm with a left common
iliac aneurysm with plaque.  The distal superficial femoral
artery, popliteal and BK Evylen Grandaw diseased, the single vessel run
off via the peroneal was reconstituted to the dorsalis pedis
pulse.  There was no posterior tibial pulse.

Recommendations were to hold his Coumadin, normalize his INR,
begin heparinization for goal PTT between 40 and 60, obtain
MRI/MRA of the left leg and the aorta to evaluate the aorta
and in flow disease, consider cardiac workup with
echocardiogram and PMIBI, continue antibiotics broad
spectrum, follow culture results and tailor as necessary.
Multipodus splint to the right foot to prevent heel
ulcerations.  Echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  This was a
suboptimal technical quality study, so focal wall motion
could not be excluded.  The overall ventricular function EF
was greater then 55%.  There was a mild aortic stenosis and
mitral leaflets appeared thickened, but they were unable to
adequately assess the mitral regurgitation.  There was mild
pulmonary hypertension.  Compared to 123 Any St.us study on
2008-05-01 00:00:00 there is probably a similar aortic gradient that is
slightly higher.  The patient underwent a PMIBI.  There were
no anginal or ischemic changes, but the patient did have
premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial
contractions.  His nuclear portion showed an abnormal study
with severe fixed defect involving the basilar portion of the
inferior wall.  The ejection fraction was calculated at 54%
and on visual inspection it is in the range of 65 to 70.

Medical attending evaluated the patient and a moderate
cardiac risk for surgery.  The patient had a CTA of the
abdomen and pelvis to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Findings demonstrated intrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of
4.9 by 5.2 cm.  There is an aneurysm of the right proximal
common iliac artery, which measures 4.1 by 2.9 cm.  There is
an aneurysm of the left common iliac, which measures 1.7 by
2.5 cm.  There is an aneurysm in the proximal right internal
iliac artery, which measures 1.4 to 2.0.  There is dense
vascular calcification and multiple venous collaterals seen
along the anterior subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen with
collateral flow to the right common femoral vein.  There is
moderate stenosis of the right external iliac artery.  The
celiac superior mesenteric arteries are patent.  There is
dense calcification involving the ostium of the left renal
artery and dense calcifications at the origin of the right
renal artery.  There are extensive venous intercostal
collaterals along the anterior abdominal wall.  These
findings are consistent with severe vena cava occlusion.  The
right inguinal hernia contains small bowel.  There is no
evidence of obstruction.  Incidentally there was gallstones
in the gallbladder.  Bilateral adrenal enlargement may
represent adrenal hyperplasia.  Diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis.  The patient underwent an
abdominal aortic angio with left leg run off.  There showed
significant infrarenal aortic atherosclerotic changes with
aneurysmal dilatation extending to the common iliac.  There
is diffuse atherosclerotic ulcerative plaque of the bilateral
external and internal iliac arteries.  There is severe
disease of the left superficial femoral artery, which
occluded at the adductor canal.  The left PFA is occluded and
above and below knee popliteal arteries are occluded.  There
is reconstruction of a diffusely diseased attenuated
peroneal, which reconstitutes the dorsalis pedis.

After careful review of the arteriogram and CTA a long
discussion with the patient's daughter and the patient was
determined being as a high risk and his comorbidities and
recommendations were a left below the knee amputation.  The
patient consented to that and underwent on 2008-05-01 00:00:00 a left
below the knee amputation. He tolerated the procedure well
and he was transferred to the PAC in stable condition.  He
remained hemodynamically stable.  He was transferred to the
VICU for continued monitoring and care.  Initial dressing was
removed on postoperative day number two.  The wound was
clean, dry and intact.  The skin edges were intact with no
ecchymosis and no drainage.  Physical therapy and
occupational therapy began to work with the patient.  renal
continued to follow the patient for hemodialysis needs.
Percocet caused the patient to be confused so he was started
on Tylenol #3.  Renal recommended that the patient only
receive narcotics a single dose q 24 hours supplement the
patient's break through pain with extra strength Tylenol
tablets two q 4 to 6 hours prn for pain.  The remaining
hospitalization was unremarkable.  The patient was discharged
to rehab.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.
2.  Nephrocaps one q.d.
3.  Sevelamer 800 mg t.i.d.
4.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
5.  Acetaminophen 325 to 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn for

less then 100, heart rate less then 60.
9.  Albuterol Ipratropium multi dose inhaler one to two puffs

10.  Coumadin 1 mg q.h.s.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Severe peripheral vascular disease with left leg ischemia
status post below the knee amputation.
