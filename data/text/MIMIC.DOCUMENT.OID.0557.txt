Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo male with acute on chronic renal failure with severe
electrolyte disturbances and azotemia.
.
ARF- Patient with longstanding renal failure with current
azotemia and electrolyte disturbance consistent with acute
worsening. The cause of the acute worsening was unclear but may
have been partially due to hypovolemia causing a prerenal
worsening of the function.
Per renal recommendations, the patient was not immediately a
candidate for dialysis  treated with IV fluids and electrolytes
were monitored.
.
Elevated troponin- no clear signs of cardiac ischemia, but does
have significantly elevated troponin. No CK increase. Either
purely due to ARF or recent ischemic event.
.
Social Issues - the patient had no health Kariyana Whiteker proxy upon
admission, and we managed to contact a next of Kariyana Whiteker
Ariane Mcquade, nephew) after three days. Until that point, patient was
deemed full code and was evaluated by both renal and orthopedics
for hemodialysis and fractured femur respectively. We also
contactAriane Mcquade the patient's PCP, Ariane Mcquade provided us with ample
documentation of the patient's history of refusing treatments,
including blood draws, colonoscopy, and chronic dialysis. Upon
contacting the next of Kariyana Whiteker, the patient was made DNR/DNI, but
preparations were made to proceed with dialysis. On the morning
of 2014-11-18 00:00:00, the patient became apneic and subsequently went into

pronounced at 12:29pm, and the next of Kariyana Whiteker was alerted.
