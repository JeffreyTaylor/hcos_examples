Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
# Failure to Thrive: Thought to be 2012-09-15 00:00:00 dementia and poor PO
intake; has had multiple similar admissions in the past for the
same reason.  After discussion with UPMCE health care proxy,
IR was consulted and agreed to place a G-tube because of her
persistent FTT related to poor PO intake even in the setting of
monitoring at rehab.  This was placed on 2012-09-15 00:00:00.
.
Following the procedure, the patient developed chest/abdominal
pain and leakage was noted around the G-tube. Pt was started on
Zosyn and Flagyl overnight given the possibility of a
perforation. Overnight the patient was noted to be hypotensive
with SBP's in the 90's, which was well below her baseline BP as
well as low urine output.  Later the patient was also noted to
have a moderate amount of hematemesis. Surgery was consulted and
CT abdomen was suspicious for for extravasation of contrast.
Given clinical changes, she required transfer to ICU for further
management. After discussion with family regarding grave
prognosis, decision was made to provide aggressive comfort
measures.  Pain medications were administered and she passed
away at 11:03 pm on 2012-09-15 00:00:00.  Autopsy will be pursued given
clinical circumstances.
