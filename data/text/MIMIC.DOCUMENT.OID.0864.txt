History of Present Illness:
44 yo male with history of HIV (CD4 202, VL 27,200 in 2012-01-25 00:00:00),
ESRD 2012-01-25 00:00:00 HIV nephropathy, CHF (EF 25%) who presents with dyspnea
on exertion. Pt was very lethargic when I interviewed him due to
recent ativan dose. States he has been having shortness of
breath on and off for the last week. Denies any chest pain,
palpitation, increasing LE edema, orthopnea, PND. States he has
been doing his PD 5 times a day as directed last done at 3pm and
diasylate still in peritoneal cavity. Admits to recent crack
cocaine use but could not give details. Also admits to drinking
2012-01-25 00:00:00 pint- 1 pint liquor per day. Last drink within past 24
hours. States he has had recent fevers. Denies any nausea,
vomiting. Positive non-bloody diarrhea for several days.  Was
arrousable only to pain by the time MICU resident evaluated him
- he had been given 4 mg ativan IV as he was confused, agitated,
hypertensive and tachycardic in the ED - this concerning for
ETOH W/D. As such, MICU was called to evaluate him and he was
accepted on MICU service.

Past Medical History:

-lives in own apt in public housing

Family History:
Significant for ethanol abuse in the mother as well as diabetes

Physical Exam:
MICU admit PE
T 99.1 BP 161/131 HR 130 RR 16 O2sats 96% on RA
Gen: Very lethargic, falling asleep throughout exam and not
complying with my requests, periodically apneic with snoring
(OSA)
HEENT: PERRL, mmm, anicteric
Neck: unable to assess JVD as patient would not sit up
Lungs: CTAB but very poor effort
Heart: RRR no m/r/g
Abd: Distended but soft, + fluid wave, NT, hypoactive bowel
sounds
Ext: no edema
Neuro: To lethargic to due exam, no asterixis

Pertinent Results:
ECG 2012-01-25 00:00:00- Sinus tachycardia, LAD, LVH nl intervals, no ST/T
wave changes
.
CTA chest 2012-01-25 00:00:00- No PE. Mild pulmonary edema. Fluid in upper
abdomen from peritoneal dialysis.
.
CXR 2012-01-25 00:00:00- Probable mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, given the
prior appearance of the same on earlier radiograph.
.
Stress Test 2012-01-25 00:00:00- Nonspecific T wave changes in the absence of
anginal symptoms. Blunted 2012-01-25 00:00:00 pressure response to exercise.
MIBI- Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of stress
achieved.
Enlarged left ventricle with global hypokinesis. Calculated LVEF
23%.
.
ECHO 2012-01-25 00:00:00:
- EF 20-25%
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal with severe global. Systolic function of apical
segments is relatively preserved suggestive of a non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2012-01-25 00:00:00,
the findings are similar.
Given the normal ascending aortic and left atrial size, the
absence of a history of systemic hypertension, the prominent
symmetric hypertrophy suggests an infiltrative process (e.g.,
amyloid).

Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo M with history of HIV, ESRD, CHF initially presented with
worsening DOE and altered mentation after ativan, 4 mg IV given
for agitation in ED and ? ETOH W/D, in setting of recent crack
cocaine use.
.
MICU:
.
# AMS -
- Initially, it was felt that this was likely due to ativan
given for agitation. In addition, it was questionable how
adherent patient was to his home peritoneal dialysis.
.
An ABG on admission to the MICU revealed that the patient was in
hypoxic respiratory failure. Hence, he was intubated and
oxygenated.
.
In addition, the differential on admission included:
- head bleed: Head CT negative for bleed or mass lesions
- delirium tremens: he was monitored for evidence of worsening
tachycardia/tremulousness,hypertension and placed on a CIWA
scale. he did not require any benzodiazepines.
- Infection - [**Year (4 digits) **] cx and peritoneal diasylated cultures were
negative.
-Metabolic disturbance - TSH, Ca, Lytes were wnl
.

2012-01-25 00:00:00: Extubated, initially sedated because of administration
of haldol - by 2012-01-25 00:00:00, patient more alert and answering questions.

.
# DOE - our intial diagnoses included CHF(known EF of 25%), PE,
volume overload due to failure to due PD, ACS, PNA (community
acquired vs atypical vs PCP). Also could be secondary to crack
cocaine use leading to myocardial ischemia and worsening CHF.
.
- 2012-01-25 00:00:00 : intubated for hypoxia along with general restlessness
of patient which made dialysis and other management very
difficult -> he was found to have picture of acute pulmonary
edema. He was dialyzed over the course of his MICU stay. From
time of intubation (2012-01-25 00:00:00) to day of extubation, patient
oxygenated and ventilated well.
.
-Tele monitored over MICU course. No significant events noted.
-Cardiac enzymes found to be elevated, but this was ascribed to
his baseline renal failure. No significant EKG changes.
-Induced sputum was negative for PCP Juanalberto Sanantonio Juanalberto Sanantonio was placed on a
treatment dose of IV bactrim, but this was discontinued when he
was found to be PCP Juanalberto Sanantonio.
.
# CHF -
- patient with known EF of ~ 25% from old ECHO.
- repeat ECHO on 2012-01-25 00:00:00 reveal symmetric LVH with EF ~ 25%
.
Likely multifactorial from cocaine use, ETOH use. No history of
CAD and normal perfusion stress test in 2012-01-25 00:00:00, however patient
at risk for accelerrated development of CAD due to HIV and HAART
regimen(if he is taking), tobacco use and crack cocaine use.
.
# Juanalberto Sanantonio Pt does self PD at home; however probably is poorly
compliant.
- patient received PD per renal service while in MICU with
negative fluid balance
- electrolytes were corrected as necessary
- started on Epogen for anemia and Fe for iron deficiency
anemia.
.
# Juanalberto Sanantonio Unclear if he has been taking HAART regimen and Bactrim.

-started for a short period on HAART, then discontinued.
- CD4 was 319 on 2012-01-25 00:00:00; last VL [**Numeric Identifier **] 2012-01-25 00:00:00.
.
# Anemia- Baseline varies from 29-35. Currently 31. No signs of
active bleeding.
-started on Iron and EPO
.
# Sinus tachycardia- Multiple causes possible including cocaine
use, ETOH use, withdrawals, fever, hypovolemia.
- intitially came in with HR to 140s-150s
- on 2012-01-25 00:00:00, on discharge to floor, HR in 100s-110s.
.
# HTN- Likely secondary to non-med compliance, ETOH and cocaine
use.
- initial HTN on admission was due likely to fluid overload and
cocaine use.
- AntiHTN home regimen: lisinopril and diltiazem
- Toxicology consult in ED recommended not to use BB because of
his cocaine use; would be cautious on discharging on a BB
because he likely will continue to use cocaine at home.
- 2012-01-25 00:00:00 pressure was controlled with nitrate in MICU; then
discontinued as his 2012-01-25 00:00:00 pressure stabilized.
.
# ETOH abuse/Cocaine abuse- Pt with recent crack cocaine use and
chronic ETOH use, drinbk 2012-01-25 00:00:00 pint- 1pint liquor qday.
.
# Diarrhea- Given HIV status could be any potential infectious
Benson Domalik. Appears to be fairly acute over past few days.
- stool cultures, cdiff, O&P  all negative
- had some diarrheal BM on discharge
.
# FEN- Renal, Low Na, cardiac diet.
.
# PPx- Heparin SC, bowel regimen
.
# Code- FULL
