History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 year old right-handed man presenting
with a few weeks of progressively worsening headache. He rarely
has headaches (certainly no migraine or recurrent severe
headaches), but he started having a headache after sustaining a
head injury on 2009-09-02 00:00:00. He was driving his car and was
broad-sided on the passenger side, causing him to hit the left
side of his head on the side window. He did not lose
consciousness and was not stunned, but actually was able to
drive
home (after the rather unpleasant other driver confronted him).
He had no external evidence of head trauma. He started having a
bitemporal, vertex, neck, and back achy that was predominantly
pulsatile, sometimes with a stabbing "needle-like" paroxysmal
pain in his eyes. The headache has been constant with no
temporal
relationship, but of concern it actually has awakened him from
sleep in the early morning hours. Getting up and walking around
has not helped; neither has the 2009-09-02 00:00:00 Ibuprofen tablets he takes,
sometimes every day. The headache has been gradually worsening
over time, and he finds that he is becoming quite lethargic with
the headache, sleeping all day while he is usually a very active
person. He has had nausea with the headache and has started to
eat less, perhaps losing 5 lbs during this time due to the
nausea. Otherwise he had no weight loss before this. He does
think he has had some subjective (unmeasured) fevers. He denies
drenching night sweats but has felt slightly sweaty at times. He
thinks he may have had one of his usual "seizures" two days ago
(described as feeling lightheaded, then hot and sweaty, then he
lays down to prevent loss of consciousness, then has some Teitelbaum
vu), but otherwise has had no apparent increased frequency above
his usual.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses headache.
Denies lightheadedness, or confusion.
Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech.
Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
Denies muscle weakness.
Denies loss of sensation.
Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient endorses subjective
fevers. Denies rigors, night sweats, or noticeable weight loss.
Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal
pain.
Denies dysuria or hematuria.
Denies myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.
