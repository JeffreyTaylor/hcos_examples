Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo lady w/ recent urosepsis, recent right transmetatarsal
ampuatation, adrenal insufficiency, temp, here w/ likely sepsis.

1. Sepsis/fever: patient was initially admitted to the MICU for
sepsis protocol. She was started on empiric antibiotic therapy
w/ vanco/levoflox/flagyl. She was pancultured and her PICC line
was removed, central line placed. Her cultures (urine, blood,
PICC line tip) are negative to date.  She was given fluid
resussitation w/ good response in her BP. She was on pressors
for a short time in the intensive care unit as well but was
quickly weaned. She was given stress dose steroids for her
recent diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. She stabalized, was
afebrile after admission, and was transferred to the medical
floor in stable condition. Her vancomycin and flagyl were
stopped secondary to lack of culture data and stable, afebrile
course. Levoflox was continued for 7 day course to tx for ?UTI.
2007-05-10 00:00:00 surgery service followed patient closely and felt her
RLE warranted elective BKA but there was no active site of
infection. Exam consistent w/ dry gangrene. ?RLE cellulits noted
on admission H+P resolved quickly and was not thought to be
source for sepsis. Upon d/c, she will be on no further
antibiotic therapy.

2.  Adrenal insufficiency/hemorrhage: patient had adrenal
insufficiency during admission, was given stress dose steroids.
Endocrine was consulted and requested dedicated ABD CT to
adrenal glands. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage was noted on the
scan. She was at risk for this, given her recent surgery,
coumadin use, hospitalization. Her hematocrits remained stable.
Her steroids were rapidly weaned to prednisone 5 mg/day and
fludricortisone was added on 2007-05-10 00:00:00 as well. An early morning
cortisytropin stim test was done during admission (123 Any St.us to
her daily prednisone 5 mg dose given). This showed cortisol 1.3
w/ stim to 1.5 and 1.6 at 30 min and 60 min, respectively. This
indicates that the patient remains adrenally insufficient and
should continue on her prednisone. ACTH and aldosterone are
pending at the time of this dictation and will be followed up as
outpatient. Patient is scheduled for follow up with Endocrine
clinic. BP's remained stable after ICU course.

3. Hyperglycemia: not diabetic but kept on insulin scale while
on high dose steroids. D/c'd this during her admission when
steroids tapered down.

4. hypercoagulable state: has h/o of this-- is on coumadin.
Details unclear. Goal INR 2007-05-10 00:00:00. Coumadin transiently stopped
during admit for line placement, etc. Restarted and will need
dose adjustments after discharge.

5. PVD: s/p Right transmetatarsal amputation last month.
2007-05-10 00:00:00 followed patient during admission. On coumadin as
above. Plans for right BKA discussed at length. Dr. Hildra Clayter from
Cucinotta surgery wished to do this electively in 2 weeks, but
not on this admission. Follow up scheduled.

6. thromocytopenia: stable and chronically low. No clear
med-related decrease. Stable counts on admission. Peripheral
smear w/o abnormality.
