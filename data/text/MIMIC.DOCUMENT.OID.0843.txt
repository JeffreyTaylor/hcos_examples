Service: NMED

Allergies:
Naproxen / Diltiazem / Propranolol

Attending:Analexis Magovern
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 85 year old woman with past medical history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolinemia, and vertebral aneurysm who
presents with dizziness.  She awoke on the morning of admission
with sense of dizziness and dysequilibrium like things were
moving around her. The sensation was worsened with head
movements and present in all positions. She denied any nausea,
diplopia, or neck pain. When she walked, felt unsteady and had
to hold onto things to steady herself. She then had developed a
pain which she is unable to characterize further all over her
head that build up to 2007-10-20 00:00:00 but is now 2007-10-20 00:00:00. She also complained
of photophobia but denied any visual, speaking, or swallowing
difficulties.  Of note, she did have a cough but no fever in
past week.  She denied any recent trauma or neck manipulations.

Her neighbor came over and then called 911; patient was then
taken to UPMCE hospital where she was found to be hypertensive
to 200/100. A non-contrast head CT was negative and she refused
spinal tap.  Records indicated that she was hospitalized two
weeks ago at this 123 Any St. for dizziness and hypertension.
Patient says that she has been having dizzy spells with sitting
and standing up.  The spells last a few minutes.  Patient had
MRI/MRA of head for these dizzy spells 6 months ago which showed
aneurysm in the "cavernous."  She saw a Neurosurgeon at UPMCE who told her surgery not indicated at that time.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no intracranial
mass effect or hydrocephalus. Several foci of T2 signal
hyperintensity are demonstrated within the subcortical and
periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres
consistent with chronic microvascular infarction. No acute
infarction is identified. Two tiny foci of low signal is seen
within the left thalamus and left temporal lobe on
susceptibility sequences, may be areas of tiny hemorrhage or
mineralization. There are symmetric, large, bilateral cavernous
carotid aneurysms identified (please see below for
measurements). There is opacification of the right mastoid air
cells. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. The
remaining osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF 123 Any St.: There are bilateral,
symmetrically-appearing cavernous carotid aneurysms identified.
The left cavernous carotid aneurysm measures 2.1 x 1.7 cm, and
the right cavernous carotid aneurysm measures 2.0 x 2.1 cm.
Normal flow signal is demonstrated within these aneurysms.
Normal flow signal is present within both vertebral arteries,
basilar artery, both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries,
both anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, both superior
cerebellar arteries, both middle cerebral arteries, both
posterior cerebral arteries, and intracranial portions of the
carotid arteries. An azygous anterior cerebral artery is
present. There are no areas of significant stenoses identified.
The posterior communicating arteries are not well visualized.

MRA OF THE CAROTIDS AND VERTEBRAL ARTERIES: Continuous flow
signal is demonstrated within both vertebral arteries, both
common carotid arteries, and both internal carotid arteries
without evidence of significant stenosis or ulceration.

Carotid dopplers: Minimal wall-thickening involving the internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. However, the peak systolic
velocities bilaterally are normal, as are the ICA to CCA ratios.
There is also normal antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 85 year old woman with history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolinemia, and anerysm who presented with
dysequilibrium and headache.  Her neurologic exam was nonfocal
but we felt her history of dysequilibrium without nausea was
suggestive of central process such as stroke or cervical
vertigo.  We initially recommended MRI/MRA of the brain to
evaluate for any stroke or aneurysm.

Her neurologic symptoms resolved shortly after admission.
MRI/MRA on 2007-10-20 00:00:00 provided no evidence of hemorrhage or acute
infarction. MRI/MRA also revealed large, bilateral cavernous
carotid aneurysms without evidence of thrombus. No areas of
significant stenoses were identified.  Carotid series revealed
minimal bilateral ICA plaque, with no ap123 Any St.ble associated
stenosis.


Surgery was consulted for possible treatment for the aneurysms,
and an angiogram was performed on 2007-10-20 00:00:00.  During the
angiogram, patient had onset of left sided hemiparesis. On MRI,
diffusion weighted images showed several areas of increased
signal are involving both cerebral hemispheres as well as the
pons. No corresponding abnormalities are seen on the FLAIR and
T2 weighted images. These findings were indicative of acute
posterior circulation infarcts involving the brain stem and
cerebellum, likely due to showering of the emboli during
angiogram. There was no evidence of hemorrhage seen.

She was transferred from Neurology stroke service to the
Neurology/Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit on 2007-10-20 00:00:00 for blood
pressure management.  On 2007-10-20 00:00:00, she was considered to be
clinically stable and was transferred back to the Neurology
stroke service.  On 2007-10-20 00:00:00 she developed worsening shortness of
breath with a productive cough, low grade fever, and increased
white blood cell count. Chest x-ray was consistent with
pneumonia, presumably due to aspiration. Flagyl and Levoquin
were started for emperic treament of pneumonia as well as a
concomitant urinary tract infection. She responded to the
antibiotics, and her mental status improved slightly.  PICC line
was placed for long term antibiotic therapy and parenteral
nutrition.

Post-angiogram and subsequent stroke, patient was kept NPO due
to swallowing difficulties and aspiration risk. She transiently
had an nasogastric tube for nutrition and medication
administration. After tube was removed, family refused
replacement. They also refused PEG placement, stating that
patient did not want to be kept alive by artificial means.
Conversations with her primary care physician confirmed this.
Subsequently, plan was made between patient's family and the
medical team that patient would receive parenteral nutrition and
antibiotics with frequent reassessment of her neurologic status
and plan of care. After several days of therapy, the patient's
mental status was unimproved and recurrent aspiration lead to
further respiratory compromise. Family changed goal of care to
comfort measures onlyon 2007-10-20 00:00:00 and patient died from
respiratory failure later that evening.
