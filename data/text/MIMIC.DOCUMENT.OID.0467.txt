Service:  Vascular Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ruptured, infected right femoral
pseudoaneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 82 year old white female
with coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft,
cerebrovascular accident, diabetes, hypertension, renal
artery stenosis, status post left renal artery stent,
peripheral vascular disease, had undergone a right common
femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass graft with PTFE on
2007-07-22 00:00:00 by Dr. Lamera Smalt.  After the patient developed
gangrene of her lower saphenectomy site with two ulcers.

The patient did well until she had a catheterization via her
right groin in 2007-07-22 00:00:00.  The patient
developed a right groin hematoma which was evacuated in 2007-07-22 00:00:00.  At that time there was no graft involvement.

The patient was sent to the UPMCE Emergency Room from UPMCE on
2007-07-22 00:00:00 with recent history of fevers and development
of a pulsatile mass in her right groin.  The right groin
began to bleed and the patient was sent for evaluation.  In
the Emergency Room the patient was diagnosed with an infected
pseudoaneurysm and was admitted for emergency surgery.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was at UPMCE prior to admission.  She does not drink alcohol.  She
does not smoke cigarettes.  She has a son, daughter-in-law
and daughter who are very involved in her care.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 9.4, hemoglobin
7.8, hematocrit 22.5, platelets 314,000, PT 13.9, PTT 28.8,
INR 1.3.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.5, chloride 108,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 54, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated in the Emergency
Room.  She was noted to have a bleeding pulsatile mass in her
right groin.  She had a fever to 102.  She was taken to the
Operating Room for emergent repair of her infected right
groin pseudoaneurysm.  The proximal prosthetic graft was
removed.  The distal prosthetic graft could not be separated
from the surrounding tissue and therefore was ligated.  A
right common femoral to profunda femoris artery bypass graft
with right superficial femoral artery was done. The patient
received 6
units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively for her
hematocrit of 22.  Post transfusion, hematocrit was 33.7.
The patient was kept on heparin infusion.  She was started on
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  At the end of surgery
the patient had a cool right lower extremity from the foot to
the knee.  No doppler signals were found at the dorsalis
pedis or posterior tibial.  Dr. Lamera Smalt felt there was no
possibility of revascularization.  He discussed the necessity
of an above the knee amputation in the future with the
family.  Postoperatively the patient remained intubated.  Her
urine output decreased considerably.  She was determined to
be in metabolic acidosis.  Tube feedings were started via
oral gastric tube.  Blood cultures grew Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Tissue culture grew
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The Renal Service was consulted for the patient's oliguria
and elevated creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2.  Because of her
renal artery stenosis and recent left renal artery stent
placement, they felt the patient's right kidney was not
functioning.  They therefore recommended that her systolic
blood pressure be kept greater than 140 and less than 180 to
maintain adequate renal perfusion.  In the meantime, until
renal function improved all medications were to be dosed for
a creatinine clearance of approximately 25 cc/hr.

The patient failed multiple attempts to wean her to
extubation.  She was felt to be fluid overloaded as well as
having extremely thick secretions.  She was diuresed with
Lasix prn and then a Lasix drip.  She had a bronchoscopy on
2007-07-22 00:00:00 and secretions grew Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Chest x-ray showed a left lung
collapse and she had a repeat bronchoscopy on 2007-07-22 00:00:00.
Secretions again grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  On 2007-07-22 00:00:00, large pleural effusion was seen and
the patient underwent ultrasound-guided aspiration of the
left pleural effusion.  One liter of fluid was drained.
Cultures were negative.  Possibility of a tracheotomy was
discussed with the family who refused to consider it at that
time.  Following the pleural tap, the patient continued to
improve and was finally extubated 2007-07-22 00:00:00.
Postoperatively she did fairly well with Albuterol and
Ipratropium inhalation as well as Albuterol and Ipratropium
nebulizer treatment as needed.  Aggressive chest physical
therapy was also used to help clear her secretion.

After extubation, the patient continued to receive total
parenteral nutrition.  Bedside speech and swallow evaluation
could not be done.  The patient refused all food and refused
to take part in the swallow evaluation.  The patient's family
was able to bring in homemade foods which the patient was
able to eat small quantities.  A repeat bedside evaluation
done on 2007-07-22 00:00:00 showed definite aspiration.  Aspiration
precautions were put in place.  The patient's family
consented to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.
The patient was then NPO except for medications.

The patient's right leg deteriorated significantly.  Family
discussed right above the knee amputation and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy placement with the patient on 2007-07-22 00:00:00.  A decision was made to go ahead with both procedures
on 2007-07-22 00:00:00.  The patient and family requested
Do-Not-Resuscitate/Do-Not-Intubate status.

The patient had developed some redness along her right groin
wound with minimal drainage.  Levofloxacin and Flagyl were
added to her Vancomycin.  Her abdominal staples had been
removed on 2007-07-22 00:00:00.

The patient had urine culture which grew 10,000 to 100,000
yeast.  This was treated with three days of intravenous
Fluconazole.  A stool culture from 2007-07-22 00:00:00 was sent and
was Clostridium difficile positive.  The patient was started
on a two week course of Flagyl on 2007-07-22 00:00:00.

At the time of dictation, the patient's right groin wound is
almost healed.  She will have dry sterile dressing changes
b.i.d.  Her abdominal incision is clean, dry and intact.  Her
right above the knee amputation incision is clean, dry and
intact.  Staples should remain for one month from surgery
before removal.  Appointment with Dr. Lamera Smalt in the office
should be made for removal.  The patient should continue her
Vancomycin through 2007-07-22 00:00:00.  She has been dosed per
level less than 15.  At the time of dictation she has a
random Vancomycin level pending and should receive 1 gm of
intravenous Vancomycin today.  The patient will finish her
Flagyl on 2007-07-22 00:00:00 for her Clostridium difficile
treatment.
