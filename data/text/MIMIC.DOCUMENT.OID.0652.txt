HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the hospital
on 2009-05-03 00:00:00, and taken to the Operating Room for
enucleation of the pancreatic mass and lysis of adhesions.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, however, in the
Post Anesthesia Care Unit she was noted to be extremely
somnolent.  A blood gas revealed a pCO2 of 104.  The patient
was followed closely.  Given the fact that her blood gases
did not improve and it was thought that she had been
over-narcotized, the patient was electively intubated and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring.

She remained hemodynamically stable the this event, however,
her pH was significantly decreased, running from 7.04 to 7.1.
The patient's course in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was
only notable for a transient rise in her liver function
tests.  These, however, slowly trended down.

The patient was extubated and her respiratory status remained
good.  She was started on her outpatient cardiac medications.
Her diet was fully advanced.

On 2009-05-03 00:00:00, the patient was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to the floor with intensive pulmonary toilet.  Her
diet was advanced.  A drain amylase was checked and revealed
a value of 3,724.  Value was rechecked.  This value trended
down, however, given the fact that the patient was stable,
her diet was advanced.  She was tolerating p.o.

It was decided that she would be discharged home on her
preoperative medications on 2009-05-03 00:00:00, in stable condition.
