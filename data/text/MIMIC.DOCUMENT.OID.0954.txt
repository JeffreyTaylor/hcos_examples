History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 75 year old right handed woman with a
history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypertension, and
Grave's Disease who presented with headache, vomiting, and
confusion, and was transferred from an OSH with left
temporoparietal IPH with midline shift and left uncal
herniation.
The history is obtained from the patient's husband and daughter.

The patient was in her usual state of health until 8:00-8:30 pm
on the evening prior to admission when she complained of a
headache and wanted to lay down. At approximately 10:00 pm she
called out her husband's name, and said help me. She walked from
the bedroom to the bathroom and vomited. Her husband found her
sitting on the edge of the tub confused, saying "give me a few
minutes". She had difficulty sitting upright and was leaning to
the left per her husband. She was more sleepy than usual. After
10 minutes, her husband called 911. Der Delapp husband denied any head
trauma. Per EMS notes, exam showed pupils pinpoint, EKG showed
sinus bradycardia at 50 bpm.

She initially presented to UPMCE Hospital, where SBP
174/79. Labs showed WBC 12.5, plt 185, INR 2.2, glucose 213, Cr
0.9. Head CT at the OSH showed 6.5 x 3.3 cm acute
intraparenchymal hematoma in the left temporoparietal lobe with
surrounding edema and 1.4 cm midline shift to the right, left
uncal herniation with impending transtentorial herniation. She
was given 2 U FFP and intubated. It is difficult to determine
what other medications she received, but they may include
Decadron 10 mg, Fosphenytoin 1 gm, Labetalol, Succs, Fentanyl,
and Valium. She was transferred to UPMCE for further care.

At the UPMCE ED, INR was 2.0 on admission. Here she was given
Vitamin K 10 mg IV, Profilnine, and Nicardipine gtt.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAM:
VS: temp 97.7, bp 155/97, HR 76, RR 18, SaO2 100% (intubated)
Genl: Intubated, eyes open
HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, bilateral conjunctival injection
CV: Regular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales
Abd: +BS, soft, NTND abdomen

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Intubated, eyes open. Does not follow commands to
squeeze hands bilaterally. Does not arouse to name being called
or sternal rub.

Cranial Nerves: Pinpoint pupils nonreactive to light, 1.5 mm on
the left and 1 mm on the right. Minimal corneal reflex
bilaterally, slightly more brisk on the left. No gag reflex. No
obvious facial asymmetry. Eyes turn in the same direction as the
head with Doll's eye maneuver.

Motor/Sensation: No observed myoclonus, asterixis, or tremor.
The
patient withdraws her right>left upper extremity to noxious
stimulus. She occasionally spontaneously moves her right upper
extremiy. There is a flicker of contraction of her bilateral
lower extremities to noxious, but she does not withdraw them.
She
occasionally spontaneously rotates her left lower extremity.

Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric in biceps, brachioradialis, and
knees.
No ankle clonus. Toes equivocal bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CT Head (123 Any St.): large left temporal lobe intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with extensive surrounding edema resulting in 13mm
rightward shift of normally midline structures and entrapment of
the right lateral ventricle. There is associated mild left uncal
herniation

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 75 year old right handed woman with a history
of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin (INR 2.2),hypertension, and
Grave's Disease who presented with a left temporoparietal IPH
with midline shift and left uncal herniation.
Her exam evidences the absence of some brain stem reflexes (gag,
dolls eyes, corneal reflexes) though her exam was not completely
consistent with brain death. Given her poor exam and extensive
size of her hemorrhage she was not a surgical candidate. She was
admitted to the ICU her INR was reversed her SBP was kept less
than 140 and she was started on Dilantin and Mannitol. An MRI
showed  Several areas of restricted diffusion within the left
occipital lobe, left thalamus, mid brain, and corpus callosum
most consistent with acute infarction. A few foci of increased
susceptibility within the left thalamus and to a lesser extent
midbrain suggestive of Duret hemorrhage.
 On the first morning of her hospital day she had no eye opening
no blink to threat she made a weak attempt to localize on the
right and withdrew her lower extremeties and left arm. Stroke
neurology was consulted and felt that she should not have
surgery due to size of bleed and dominent hemisphere and
recommended medical management.
Extensive discussion were held with the family from
neurosurgery, neurology and critcal care team to discuss the
gravity of the situation.
On her second hospital day the patients exam did not not improve
the family had a meeting with pallative care they planned an
extubation with Morphine and Ativan for comfort. The patient
passed away on 2012-01-29 00:00:00.
