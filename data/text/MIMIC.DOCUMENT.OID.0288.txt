History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old female with PMHx of hyperlipidemia who
presents to the CCU tonight after her PCP sent her to UPMCE
Emergency department for an enlarged heart on CXR.

The patient's history begins about 5 weeks ago when she
experienced left anterior chaest pain which woke her around 0500
that mornig.  Pain is worse with breathing and radiated into her
left arm and left side of the neck.  She went to UPMCE
(which records were obtained) and had an MI workup including 2
sets of negative cardiac enzymes, a negative stress test, and an
unremarkable echo.  She also with CT scan for r/o PE which found
a 5 mm nodule in the RUL but not other findings.  Patient was
discharged from the hospital with no clear diagnosis.  Prior to
onset of symptoms, she denied any recent local or foreign travel
or cough/cold symptoms.

Patient continued to have chest pain over the next month.
Earlier this week she started having fevers, chills, and night
sweats.  Temperature taken at home was max 100.8.  She did
experience some SOB and nausea, but no vomiting.  She presented
to an OSH where she refused labs as she had already undergone
workup and was discharged with a Zpack.  She noted continued
symptoms and decided to see her PCP today who ordered a CXR and
saw cardiomegaly, pleural and pericardial effusion and sent her
to the ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were 18:04 8 99.2 106 116/72 20 97%.
She was having 2006-08-01 00:00:00 pain worse while lying supine and relieved
sitting upright.  Pt states pain in chest, neck, upper abdomen
and upper back. Pt with some sob with exersion.  Patient given
toradol IV and Zosyn, 1L NS, fentanyl.  Pulses done at bedside
by cardiology fellow which revealed only 10 mmHg.  Bedside echo
showed moderate to large pericardial effusion with right atrial
diastolic collapse and impaired R ventricular filling upon
inspiration.
.
On arrival to the CCU patient has an aching pain 2006-08-01 00:00:00 with
family at the bedside.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
2006-08-01 00:00:00
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There
is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling.
.
TTE 2006-08-01 00:00:00
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2006-08-01 00:00:00,
the findings are similar.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Overall cardiac contour appears somewhat smaller than on
123 Any St.us study in
this patient status post pericardiocentesis for a pericardial
effusion.  There continued to be layering bilateral effusions
with associated bibasilar airspace opacities, which most likely
represent partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia
cannot be entirely excluded.  There is cephalization of the
pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous
hypertension but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is
seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
diminished given supine technique.  Overall mediastinal contours
are stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Ms Jan is a 52 y/o female with no significant past medical
history who initially presented with constitutional symptoms for
1 week found to have pericardial effusion transferred to CCU for
pericardial drainage.

# Pericardial effusion:  Ddx was infectious vs. neoplastic vs.
autoimmune. Symptoms likey represent viral pericarditis with
effusion development however in the setting of systemic
complaints a broad ddx was entertained. She underwent an
uncomplicated pericardicentesis on 2006-08-01 00:00:00 with drain placed. 400
cc serosanginous fluid was initially drained; additional 200cc
drained thereafter. Once fluid slowed drain was pulled. Fluid
analysis: WBCs 275, 69% lymphs; cytology returned negative and
cultures without growth. Additional work-up notable for TSH:
0.95, Hebert Schmeider: 1:40, complement levels wnl, cardiac enzymes negative
x3. Quantiferon gold (ordered on 2006-08-01 00:00:00) was pending at time of
discharge. Of note, patient reports cancer screening uptodate
with nl mammography in 2006-08-01 00:00:00 and c-scope ~7years prior.
Due to concern for underlying pericarditis patient was started
on ibuprofen and colchicine and patient symptomatically
improved. Discharged with plan to continue ibuprofen UPMCE and
colchicine for 2 weeks. Patient instructed to take NSAIDS with
food to avoid gastritis
FOLLOW-UP:
[] Obtain repeat TTE in 1 week to ensure resolution of effusion
[] Follow-up quantiferon gold
[] Continue treatment of presumed pericarditis x2weeks.
.
# Bilateral pleural effusions. On admission CXR with enlarged
cardiac siluette and clear lung fields. On 2006-08-01 00:00:00 patient
developed fever to 101 and CXR was obtained in broad fever
work-up. Imaging revealed interval development of small
bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial markings. DDx:
cardiac congestion/pulmonary edema vs serositis. Repeat CXR
confirmed findings of fluid overload. Remainder of exam was
without signs of heart failure (elevated JVP, LE edema) or signs
of reaccumulation of pericardial effusion leading to heart
failure. Patient was completely asymptomatic with O2 saturation
wnl. At time of discharge patient was saturating >95%RA with
respiratory rates 2006-08-01 00:00:00.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
[] Repeat CXR in 1 week to assess effusions

# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient continued on Pravastatin 40 mg daily

# Normocytic Anemia: Patient with baseline normocytic anemia.
123 Any St.us etiology thought to be fibroid uterus (she is now s/p
hysterectomy) as well as potential GI bleed (c-scope ~7yrs ago
without overt pathology per patient) On admission no signs of
blood loss - denying melena, hematchezia, hematemesis. Iron
studies were suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
[] Trend hematocrit
[] Consider further GI work-up

# Hypoalbumenia. On admission albumin 2.9. INR on discharge 1.2.
Remaining LFTs wnl. No preceding hx of liver disease; no
stigmata of concern liver disease on exam
OUTPATIENT ISSUE:
[] Repeat albumin and LFTs as outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at UPMCE. You were found to
have an effusion or collection of fluid in your lungs and
surrounding your heart. We think this is because of a virus but
we have sent tests to look for other causes. These test results
will be communicated to you by Dr. Jan next monday. We drained
the fluid around your heart it does not seem to have
reaccumulated. You will need to have an echocardiogram and a
chest Xray done on Friday.
Please take colchicine and ibuprofen twice daily for two weeks
to decrease the pain and inflammation.

Followup Instructions:
Name: Hebert Schmeider
Specialty: Primary Care
When: Monday 2006-08-01 00:00:00 at 11:30am
Address: 123 Any St.,[**Numeric Identifier 802**]
Phone: test@mail.com
.
Echocardiogram and chest Xray 2006-08-01 00:00:00. This will be done
at UPMCE. Please call test@mail.com if you have not heard about
this test in the next 1-2 days.
