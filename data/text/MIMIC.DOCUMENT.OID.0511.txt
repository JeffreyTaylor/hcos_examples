Attending:Jikai Kyro
Chief Complaint:
syncopal episode

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Adhvaith is a 32 year old right handed woman with a history
of hypertension (post partum only), migraine headaches, and G6PD
deficiency who presents to the UPMCE ED as a transfer from the
UPMCE where she was noted to have a syncopal episode when
waiting to get a scheduled lumbar spine MRI due to complaints of
lower back pain localized to the region of her epidural (present
only since pregnancy).

She is somnolent at the time of this history, but states that
she
was given a prescription for some medicine to be taken prior to
the procedure.  She took 4 pills and refers to a bottle of
lorazepam 1mg tablets.  Witnesses (per ED staff) state that she
lost consciousness, but did not have any evidence of seizure
activity.  Her vital signs at that time were notable for a blood
pressure of 180/110.  She was noted to be oriented but lethargic
and was sent to the ED for further evaluation.

Upon arrival to the ED, she had a CT of her head that was
negative for any abnormality. The patient herself states that
she
was on pain medication (tylenol #3 and percocet for her back
pain, but discontinued this due to the fact that the medication
was making both her and her baby constipate; she was breast
feeding until yesterday).

Her blood pressure upon arrival to the ED was also persistently
elevated, up to the 190s.  She was given x1 dose of labetalol,
but this did not help lower her BP, so she was started on a
drip.

delivery, and subsequent sharp bilateral occipital headache that

Brief Hospital Course:
32 year old right handed woman with a history of
hypertension, migraine headaches, and G6PD deficiency who is
G5P3023 and 21 days s/p NSVD with epidural anesthesia who
presented to the UPMCE Ed after having had a syncopal episode
while waiting to have her planned L-spine MRI on day of
admission as an
outpatient.
As patient was sonAdhvaith Kirkpatrick and her blood pressure control had been
consistently in the 160s-190s/100s despite now being on a
labetalol drip, we were concerned with a possible diagnosis of
PRES. Her UA did not show evidenvce of proteinuria.
She was admitted to NeuroICU on labetolol drip for BP control
and on magnesium sulfate and a brain MRI and spinal cord were
performed. No evidence of PRES was found on brain MRI and spinal
MRI was also normal (PLEASE, FOLLOW-UP OFFICIAL REPORTS AS
OUTPATIENT). Her mental status returned back to baseline and she
was weaned off labetol drip and magnesium sulfate with good
control of BP with PO regimen.
