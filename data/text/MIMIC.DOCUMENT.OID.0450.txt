ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease.
2.  Aortic and mitral valve disease.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aortic valve stenosis.
2.  Mitral valve regurgitation.
3.  Status post aortic valve replacement with 21 mm
pericardial valve, mitral valve repair with 28 mm Joran Penyak
annuloplasty band.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
woman with a history of rheumatic heart disease.  She has
known aortic and mitral valve disease.  Her last
echocardiogram was done on 2010-01-10 00:00:00 which revealed an ejection
fraction of 60%.  Moderately severe MR Eldon Bleakley enlarged
LA were demonstrated as well as moderate to severe aortic
stenosis with an estimated valve area of 0.9 cm squared.
There was also significant pulmonary hypertension with PA
pressures estimated at 64 mmHg.  Most recent ETT was negative
in 2010-01-10 00:00:00 and performed for brief complaints of chest
discomfort.  Clinically patient reports that she is very
active.  She walks several miles a day, cross country skiis
and is able to cut and stack wood for her fireplace.  Over
the past three weeks, however, she has noticed decrease in
activity tolerance along with chest pain and mild shortness
of breath that occurs with vigorous exertion.  She reports
that this discomfort can take up to several hours to resolve.
She has never taken nitroglycerin.  She is now referred for
cardiac catheterization.  Patient denies claudication,
orthopnea, edema, PND, lightheadedness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Hypercholesterolemia.
Smoking history, quit 20 years ago.  Insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus.  Rheumatic heart disease.  Autoimmune iron
disease.  Hypothyroidism.  Osteoporosis.  Bilateral carotid
bruit without significant carotid disease.  Breast cancer
status post chemotherapy and surgery.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post left mastectomy in 2010-01-10 00:00:00.
Cholecystectomy in 2010-01-10 00:00:00.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Miacalcin nasal spray, Levoxyl 200
mcg q.d., Lipitor 10 mg q.d., enalapril 5 mg q.d., Celebrex
200 mg b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., folate 1 mg q.d., NPH 15
units q.h.s., regular and Humalog insulin sliding scale.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient was an elderly
woman who appeared younger than her stated age and was in no
acute distress.  Vital signs were stable, afebrile.  Height
was 5'2", weight 122 pounds.  HEENT was normocephalic,
atraumatic, EOMI, PERRL, anicteric.  Throat was clear.  Neck
was supple, midline, without masses or lymphadenopathy.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
was regular rate and rhythm with a 2010-01-10 00:00:00 to 3/6 systolic
ejection murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender
without masses or organomegaly.  Extremities were warm, not
cyanotic, not edematous times four.  Neuro was grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission CBC was 12/11.6/35.4/336.
Chemistries 138/4.1/104/27/13/0.7.  INR was 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had cardiac catheterization
performed on 2010-01-10 00:00:00 which revealed 3+ mitral valve
regurgitation, calcification of the aortic valve, ejection
fraction of 61%, severe aortic stenosis, normal coronary
arteries.  Patient now presents for elective valve repair.
On 2010-01-10 00:00:00 patient was taken to the operating room and had
aortic valve placement with a 21 mm pericardial valve and
mitral valve repair with a 28 mm Joran Penyak annuloplasty band.
Patient was subsequently taken to the CSRU for close
monitoring.  Patient did well and was initially A-paced for
blood pressure support.  Drips, chest tubes and pacing wires
were discontinued as her clinical condition allowed.

The patient had a largely unremarkable postoperative course
and was subsequently transferred to the floor on
postoperative day two.  On the floor her status was again
unremarkable and patient was ambulating well on her own
without physical therapy.  Patient did test her own blood
sugar glucoses and maintained her own blood sugars with her
own sliding scale.  She is very aggressive about this and
took her finger sticks at least eight times a day.
Ultimately, patient was discharged on postoperative day four,
tolerating a regular diet, had adequate pain control on p.o.
pain meds and had been cleared for home by physical therapy.

The patient was placed on a 10 day course of Levaquin for an
elevated white count of 50 and x-ray finding of some right
lower lobe atelectasis as well as increased clinical sputum
production.  Patient remained afebrile.

Physical examination on discharge, in general, in no acute
distress.  Vital signs temperature 98.0, heart rate 68, blood
pressure 119/57, respirations 18, 95% in room air.  Chest was
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular
rate and rhythm.  There was no sternal click or sternal wound
drainage.  Patient did have 1+ peripheral edema.

Labs on discharge included CBC with white count of 25.4 down
from 26.2, hematocrit 24.1, platelets 235.  Chemistries
131/4.9/99/25/30/1.1/65.  Magnesium 1.7.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIET:  Diabetic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. times seven days.
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. times seven days.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
4.  Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.
5.  Levaquin 500 mg q.d. times eight days for a 10 day
course.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
7.  Levothyroxine 200 mcg q.d.
8.  NPH 15 units q.p.m.
9.  Percocet 5/325 one to two q.four hours p.r.n.
10. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

DIBleakleyE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to continue her tight
blood sugar control as well as a diabetic diet.  She should
follow up with her cardiologist in one to two weeks to
address the need for continued diuresis as well as adjustment
of cardiac medications at that time.  Patient should follow
up with Dr. 123 Any St.es) **] in four weeks' time.  Patient was
instructed to continue Levaquin as well as encourage
incentive spirometry for possible mild respiratory infection.
