Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Chaysten Oerther
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Smylie is a 75 yo male with h/o CHF and CAD s/p CABG who
presented to presented on 2011-10-13 00:00:00 to UPMCE with a
complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. Patient is
intubated at time of transfer to UPMCE, and history was obtained
almost entirely from discharge summary.
.
At time of admission to UPMCE, he described sudden
onset of sharp left-sided chest pain, with onset at rest. On
arrival to the ED, he reported shortness of breat and was found
to have SpO2 84% on room air. He was placed on a nonrebreather
and was subsequently intubated in the ED for respiratory
failure. The patient was treated with lasix and responded with
good UOP and improvement of his respiratory status. ABG
performed 90 minutes after intubation was 7.18/72/86.
.
Mr. Smylie was subseqnetly admitted to the CCC at UPMCE where he was started on standing IV lasix, Nitro paste
1" q8h, an insulin drip and Propofol for sedation.
Anti-hypertensives were held, but he was continued on ASA,
Plavix, and Lipitor. Patient was felt to be septic due to an
episode of hypotension with a fever to 101 and a leukocytosis of
17.9K. Patient was reported to be maintaining BP's of 100/60
with Vasopressin, Levophed, and IVF boluses.
.
He underwent an TTE which showed mid to distal hypokinetic areas
of the LV and a hypokinetic apex, moderate MR, and an EF of
15-20%, which is notably diminished from an EF of 40-60% two
weeks prior. Of note, patient was admitted to UPMCE
from 2011-10-13 00:00:00 with a similar presentation; at that time elevated
troponins were felt to be related to his renal insufficiency.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
ROS is notable for recent fever. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for patient motioning to
the presence of epigastric pain at time of arrival to UPMCE
(symptoms of indigestion 123 Any St.usly noted to be his anginal
equivalent). ROS is notable for the absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
Hospital, he had been complaining of shortness of breath over
the days prior to admission.

PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:
ECHO (2011-10-13 00:00:00): The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with global
hypokinesis and inferior akinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
(2011-10-13 00:00:00+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR (2011-10-13 00:00:00): There is increased pulmonary vasculature and
interstitial opacities consistent with fluid overload,
unchanged. A retrocardiac opacity is again identified and likely
represents atelectasis. An ET tube is identified approximately
5.4 cm above the carina.
.
Cardiac Cath (2011-10-13 00:00:00): Three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Elevated UPMCE-ventricular filling pressures.  Moderate systemic
arterial hypertension.
.
CXR (2011-10-13 00:00:00): The appearance of the thorax is essentially
unchanged, including the position of the ICD leads. The degree
of cardiomegaly, mild interstitial edema as well as bilateral
small pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 79 yo male with a history of CAD and CHF who
presented on 2011-10-13 00:00:00 with hypercarbic respiratory failure, elevated
troponins, and fever.  S/p cardiac cath yesterday without
intervention and ICD/Biventricular pacer.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Patient has a history of known CAD,
and he is s/p CABG.  Patient had a cardiac catheterization in
2011-10-13 00:00:00, without intervention.  During this hospital stay,
patient was continued on his home doses of ASA, Statin, Plavix,
and his daily dose of Metoprolol was increased to 200 mg.
Patient had a cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-13 00:00:00, which showed
three-vessel coronary artery disease, elevated UPMCE-ventricular
filling pressures, and moderate systemic arterial hypertension.
Patient had a TTE on admission which showed an EF of 20%.
Patient had an ICD placed on 2011-10-13 00:00:00.  He had no acute events
during this hospital course.
.
#. Respiratory failure:  Patient was admitted from the OSH,
intubated, after an episode of respiratory distress.  He was
extubated after 48 hours and was satting well on room air.
Patient had one episode of dyspnea/anxiety overnight during this
hospitalization which appeared to be related to his lack of
BIPAP use.  Patient was educated on the importance of this
intervention and proceeded to use his BIPAP each night during
this hospitalization.  Patient did not have any other acute
events during this hospitalization.
.
# Acute renal failure:  Patient's Cr increased during this
admission to 2.3 from his baseline of 1.3  This was most likely
secondary to a pre-renal etiology in the setting of aggressive
diuresis.  Patient's Cr had decreased to 1.9 prior to discharge.
 Patient's Lasix was held on discharge, and he was instructed to
follow up with his PCP regarding restarting his Lasix.
.
#. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure:  Patient had a TTE
performed during this admission which showed a LVEF of 20% and
apical wall motion abnormality.  Patient was weighed daily
during this hospitalization and his I/Os were carefully
monitored.  Patient was placed back on his home dose of Lasix,
which was then held prior to discharge in the setting of acute
renal failure.  Patient had a Biventricular  pacer placed during
this hospital admission without complication.
.
# Diabetes:  Patient was continued on his home diabetic regimen
of 24 Units of NPH twice daily.  He was maintained on a diabetic
diet and had no acute events during this hospital stay.
.
