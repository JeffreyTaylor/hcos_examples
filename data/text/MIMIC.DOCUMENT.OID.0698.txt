NOTE - An addendum will be dictated when the patient is
discharged.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
male with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency,
admitted to Coronary Care Unit following cardiac
catheterization for ventilatory support and Intensive Care
Unit monitoring.  The patient originally presented to an
outside hospital the morning of admission complaining of
chest pain and symptoms of congestive heart failure.  An
electrocardiogram showed a new left bundle branch block.  He
was then transferred to UPMCE
for emergent cardiac catheterization.  The patient went
immediately to the Catheterization Laboratory upon arrival.
Catheterization showed three vessel coronary artery disease,
patent graft, left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending, patent saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery and patent saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal 1.  It was significant for increased right
and left filling pressures.  Angioplasty was then performed
on the aortoiliac bypass graft, left circumflex coronary
artery with failed angioplasty of obtuse marginal 1.  The
patient developed significant respiratory distress following
catheterization and was ventilated for ventilatory support
with transfer to the Coronary Care Unit on a ventilator.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft redo, three vessels in 2011-09-20 00:00:00,
four vessels in 2011-09-20 00:00:00, diabetes mellitus times 13 years,
chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 2.3,
prostate cancer diagnosed in 2011-09-20 00:00:00 refractory to hormone
therapy followed by Dr. Zuriyah Silva, gout, depression, anemia,
congestive heart failure with unknown ejection fraction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of tobacco use, 30 pack years, quit
in 2011-09-20 00:00:00, occasional alcohol.

17. Lasix 60 mg b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs, temperature
96, heartrate 60, blood pressure 179/57, oxygen saturation
100% on 30% FIO2, weight 108 kg.  General:  Elderly male in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Oropharynx clear.  Neck supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Chest
clear to auscultation anteriorly, no wheezes.  Heart, regular
rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the lower left sternal
border with no radiation.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities, 1+ edema.
Pulses dopplerable bilaterally.  Venous stasis changes
bilaterally.  Neurological, intubated, sedated.  Moves
extremities times four.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count 15.8, hematocrit 29.8,
platelets 228.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.7, chloride 111,
bicarbonate 18, BUN 86, creatinine 5.0, glucose 138.  Calcium
8.7, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 4.6.  Chest x-ray:
Cardiomegaly, mild congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram, sinus rate at 80, left bundle branch
without ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular - Ischemia, the patient with
a history of coronary artery disease, transferred from an
outside hospital for emergent cardiac catheterization
following new left bundle branch block at an outside
hospital.  During catheterization, the patient underwent
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the left
circumflex with serial percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of obtuse marginal 1.  Following catheterization
he was maintained on a statin, Plavix, and Aspirin.  He was
initially on a nitroglycerin drip which was then converted
over to p.o.  He was also started on Hydralazine and titrated
up on a beta blocker.  This was subsequently converted to
Carvedilol.  The patient did not have any further episodes of
chest pain or ischemia during the hospitalization.

Pump, the patient with congestive heart failure Class 4.  The
patient underwent echocardiogram following cardiac
catheterization which showed an ejection fraction of 30 to
40% and severe hypokinesis inferiorly and posteriorly along
with 1+ mitral regurgitation and impaired ventricular
relaxation.  Immediately following catheterization the
patient was diuresed on a Natrecor drip.  He was quickly
weaned off of this and titrated over to daily intravenous
Lasix.  He was initially started on beta blocker and later
converted over to Carvedilol which he tolerated well.  He was
also started on Hydralazine and put back on his
nitroglycerin.  He continued to receive prn Lasix for
symptoms of fluid overload.

Rhythm, the patient remained in sinus rhythm and was
monitored on Telemetry throughout his hospital course.

Pulmonary - The patient was intubated following cardiac
catheterization for respiratory distress following minimal
diuresis with Natrecor drip.  The patient was quickly weaned
off of the ventilator and successfully extubated without any
complications.  He did not require any additional oxygen
requirements throughout the hospitalization and had no
symptoms of respiratory distress.

Infectious disease - The patient developed leukocytosis and
diarrhea during hospitalization and a stool sample was
positive for Clostridium difficile toxin.  He was started on
Vancomycin therapy for treatment of Clostridium difficile
colitis.  His symptoms of diarrhea improved following
initiation of antibiotic therapy.

Renal - The patient with chronic renal insufficiency with
baseline creatinine of 2.3.  At admission, his creatinine was
acutely elevated up to 5.0, thought to be due to dye load
during catheterization.  He was aggressively hydrated and his
creatinine trended down.  He briefly bumped his creatinine
due to hypovolemia during his diarrhea but this resolved with
hydration.  He was eventually put back on his daily Lasix
dose for maintenance.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient's volume
status and electrolytes were followed throughout admission.
He received multiple electrolyte re123 Any St.ns.

Heme - Anemia, the patient with baseline anemia believed due
to chronic renal insufficiency.  He was continued on iron and
Epogen per his home regimen.  He required transfusion of 2
units of packed red blood cells during the hospitalization.
His acute drop was thought to be following his
catheterization procedure.  He responded appropriately to the
transfusions and remained hemodynamically stable.

Endocrine - Patient with diabetes mellitus.  His Glipizide
was held initially and he was placed on sliding scale
insulin.  Following resumption of the regular diet he was
converted back to home medicines.

Prophylaxis - The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin and proton pump inhibitor throughout his
hospitalization.

Code status - The patient was a full code throughout the
hospitalization.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Myocardial infarction with cardiac catheterization
2.  Congestive heart failure
3.  Acute and chronic renal failure

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/FOLLOW UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Will be
dictated in an addendum to this discharge summary.
