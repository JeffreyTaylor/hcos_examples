Attending:Hoang Zafir
Chief Complaint:
Mental Status Changes/Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old male with hepatitis C, history of alcohol
abuse, bipolar affective disorder, atrial fibrillation, and a
recent admission to UPMCE for pneumonia who was transferred from
an outside hospital where he had presented with mental status
changes and dyspnea.   The patient was not able to give a full
account of the circumstances leading to his admission, but per
his family he had increasing dyspnea and confusion starting
approximately five days prior to presentation.  He may have had
chills but no fevers and he was noted to be extremely fatigued.
At the outside hospital he was febrile, bradycardic,
hypotensive, non-verbal, pale, and not following commands
reliably.  After initial lab results did not reveal a clear
source of his illness he was transferred to UPMCE for further
management.

In the UPMCE ED, initial vitals were T 100, BP 89/40, HR 45, RR
16, 94% on 2L. Over his ED course he became progressively more
hypoxic and eventually required 4.5L of O2 by nasal cannula to
maintain a sat of 92%.  He was initially bradycardic with rates
in the 40's but this spontaneously improved to 70s-90s without
interventions.  His SBP's improved to 90's-100's with 2L IVF.
His chest radiograph revealed a right middle lobe infiltrate,
which he had recently been treated for at UPMCE (admission until
2006-06-21 00:00:00).  He received vancomycin and levofloxacin for a
possible pulmonary infection as well as IV metronidazole as the
patient had diarrhea and had C diff in 2006-06-21 00:00:00.  He was
transferred to the ICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
- Atrial Fibrillation
- History of clostridium difficile
- Bipolar Affective Disorder
- History of hepatitis C
- History of rheumatic heart disease
- History of right middle cerebral artery aneurysm clipped in
2006-06-21 00:00:00 at UPMCE
- History of pernicious anemia
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Social History:
He lives with his wife.  Jamayia Sabillon has a history of alcohol abuse but
this was greater than twenty years ago.  He stopped smoking
after his 123 Any St.us hospitalization (about one month prior to
presentation) but 123 Any St.usly had a 40 pack year history.  He had
been discharged from his last hospitalization with oxygen but
had not been using this prior to admission.

Family History:
His father had lung cancer and his mother had congestive heart
failure.

Portable Chest Radiograph 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Persistent unexplained dense consolidation and
volume loss
of the right middle lobe.

CT Head 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage

Transthoracic Echocardiogram 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
-Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2006-06-21 00:00:00,
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly
higher.

Liver/Gallbladder Ultrasound 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No focal liver lesions. No ascites.

Abdomen Radiograph 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus.

CT Chest W/O Contrast 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent severe consolidation in the right middle lobe,
showing improved aeration, but no bronchial obstruction,
probably inadequately treated pneumonia.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, small on the right, very small on
the left,
improved since 2006-06-21 00:00:00, and lymphatic engorgement in the upper
lungs,
probably indication of cardiac dysfunction as well as volume
overload.
Probable calcific aortic stenosis.
3. Stigmata of cirrhosis, not fully evaluated on this study.

CT Head W/O Contrast 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality seen.

EEG 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG recording due to the
slow
and disorganized pattern, the left anterior temporal lower
amplitude
recording and the right temporal intermittent focal slowing. The
first
abnormality suggests widespread mild encephalopathy of a
metabolic,
ischemic, or medication etiology. The second abnormality
suggests a
cerebral or extra-cerebral abnormality interfering with the
voltage of
the recording such as a hematoma or severe cortical abnormality.
The
last abnormality suggests a subcortical dysfunction in the right
temporal area. Of note was the atrial fibrillation. If capturing
discrete episodes of unconsciousness or unresponsiveness is the
main
objective of this study, a more prolonged EEG telemetry should
be
considered.

Chest Radiograph 2006-06-21 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: Lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are
flattened, consistent with COPD. Compared with 2006-06-21 00:00:00, there is
a new small right pleural effusion extending into the minor
fissure. Again seen is patchy opacity at the right base,
consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. No CHF. The right
mid and upper zones of the left lung remain grossly clear. No
gross left-sided effusion. Asymmetric pleural thickening is
noted at the right lung apex.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with cirrhosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
history of tobacco abuse and recent pneumonia presenting with
dyspnea, fevers, and mental status changes.

1) Altered mental status: At presentation the patient was
minimally responsive and seemed quite somnolent.  As he was
started on treatment for presumed infection and hydrated his
mental status improved so that later in the day on 2006-06-21 00:00:00 (the
patient was admitted overnight) his family thought his ability
to answer questions and participate with conversation was near
his baseline though his responses were still delayed.  The
patient continued to have a rather odd affect and answered
questions with brief, simple responses but he was alert and
oriented*3 and could answer questions in an appropriate manner.
He maintained minimal insight, however, into the the
circumstances of his hospitalization or his health in general.
On 2006-06-21 00:00:00 the patient was noted to have a decompensation where
he would transiently have periods of staring into space and
becoming less responsive for seconds at at time.  Between these
episodes he appeared in his normal state of alertness.  He was
evaluated by neurology, had a second head CT (that remained
without acute changes), and had an essentially benign lumbar
puncture.  EEG on 2006-06-21 00:00:00 revealed a diffuse slowing pattern
consistent with unclear encephalopathy but was negative for
epileptiform activity.  Neurology also considered a diagnosis of
parkinsomism being responsible for his delayed responses and
somewhat labored speech perhaps worsened by his chronic
anti-psychotic drug therapy.  Nevertheless, as the patient was
switched to a different pneumonia regimen (see below) and
generally improved back to his baseline the suspicion was that
the patient had intermittent toxic-metabolic delirium due to his
presumed pneumonia that improved with treatment of his
infection.  B12 levels and TSH levels were also checked to rule
out reversible causes of delirium and were normal. At time of
discharge, the patient's wife thought his mental status was at
his baseline.

2) Pneumonia: At presentation the patient had a persistent
infiltrate consistent with unresolved pneumonia.  Further
imaging including CT chest were consistent with this.  The
patient initially received pipercillin-tazobactam and vancomycin
in the ICU but this was switched to levofloxacin and vancomycin
on his first full day in the hospital as despite his pneumonia
his presentation seemed less consistent with sepsis and this was
thought unlikely to be hospital-associated pneumonia as it had
been over a month since his 123 Any St.us discharge.  His respiratory
symptoms improved somewhat though he continued to get
asymptomatically hypoxic to the high 80's on room air and even
at the time of discharge required 2-3L O2 by nasal cannula to
maintain O2 sats >92%.  He also continued to spike fevers.  On
2006-06-21 00:00:00 he was switched from levofloxacin to pipercillin
tazobactam with eventual resolution of his fevers.  His
persistent hypoxia was thought most likely consistent with
resolving pneumonia in the context of his underlying lung
disease (COPD).  He was discharged to finish an additional seven
days of pipercillin-tazobactam therapy (for a total of ten days
on this antibiotic).  Given concern for his mental status and
aspiration a repeat speech and swallow evaluation was performed
and consistent with the results of the last such evaluation
during his 123 Any St.us hospitalization he was not observed to be
aspirating.

3) Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive at presentation but
this resolved with fluid boluses and never recurred.
Presumably, this initial hypotension was due to volume de123 Any St.n
in the context of decreased PO intake in the context of illness
and increased insensible losses due to fever.

4) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On presentation the patient
was bradycardic but this resolved without intervention.  He then
became tachycardic with Afib with RVR to rates in the 120's.  He
was restarted on his home flecainide dose with better rates.  He
was also continued on his home aspirin (he is not on coumadin as
he has been considered a fall risk).  Eventually, low dose beta
blocker was added for additive rate control.

6) Cytopenias: The patient has chronic anemia and
thrombocytopenia that were essentially stable during his
hospital course.  Given his history of pernicious anemia and
lack of B12 supplementation B12 level was checked and was
supra-normal (folate level was also normal). He has had past
hematologic work up for this problem without a clear source
identified though he is on multiple medications (valproate,
flecainide) that can cause marrow suppression and he also had
signs of cirrhosis on imaging, which can lead to cytopenias due
to sequestration.  Once hemolysis was ruled out by smear and
labs and has his counts remained stable further work up was
deferred in the context of his more acute issues.

7) Bipolar Affective Disorder: The patient was continued on his
home doses of valproate and olanzapine with stable affect.

8)Cirrhosis: Imaging findings on his CT exam were consistent
with cirrhosis and 123 Any St.us notes mention a history of hepatitis
C though he has had negative antibody tests in the past
(antibodies to Hep B have also been negative).  Possible
etiologies could include past alcohol use vs Non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis vs cryptogenic cirrhosis.  As there were no
signs of acute decompensation this issue was deferred to
outpatient management and he was set up for outpatient follow up
in hepatology clinic.

9) Recent fall:  The patient had a recent fall leading to
abrasions on his lower extremities.  These were cared for with
local measures.  PT evaluation suggested the patient would need
near constant assistance and recommended acute rehab.  He and
his wife expressed a preference for being sent home with
multiple services including home PT and this was set up prior to
discharge.

The patient was fed a full, cardiac diet.  He was full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for altered mental status and trouble
breathing.  Ultimately, we think this was due to your pneumonia
recurring.  We gave you antibiotics to treat your pneumonia but
because your mental status remained a bit worse than normal we
also did scans of your head and a lumbar puncture to make sure
you didn't have infection or bleeding.  Your studies did not
show these.  You are being discharged to finish recovering from
pneumonia.

Your medications have been changed.  Please take your
medications as prescribed.

Please come to your local ED or call your doctor if you have
worsening of your breathing, chest pain, fevers, chills,
shortness of breath, or any other concerning changes in your
health.
