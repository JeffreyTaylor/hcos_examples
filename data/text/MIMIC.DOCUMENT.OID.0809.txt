Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the 123 Any St. (123 Any St.es) **] 123 Any St.es) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF= 55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild mitral
regurgitation.

POST-BYPASS:

Biventricular systolic function is normal. Mitral regurgitation
may be slightly improved. Thoracic aorta appears intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on 2010-04-19 00:00:00 where he
underwent a CABG x 3. She was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition. He was extubated post op. He was tranfused. He was
weaned from his neo and transferred to the floor on POD #2. He
has rapid atrial fibrillation for which he was started on
amiodarone and his lopressor was increased, and he was started
on coumadin. His chest tubes and wires were discontinued with
out incident.
He then remained in sinus rhythm and was ready for discharge
home on POD #6.
Spoke with Kaebri Hamama office who confirmed that Dr.
Kaebri Hamama will assume coumadin management.
