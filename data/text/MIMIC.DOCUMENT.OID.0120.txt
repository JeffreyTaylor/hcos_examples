Surgeon: 123 Any St.es) **], M.D. 18068

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease, aortic
stenosis severe, mitral regurgitation moderate, peripheral
vascular disease, hypertension.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease, aortic
stenosis severe, mitral regurgitation moderate, peripheral
vascular disease, hypertension.

OPERATION: Case planned for an aortic valve replacement,
mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft,
cancelled secondary to intraoperative carotid injury during
left internal jugular vein Swan introducer placement by
anesthesia.

PROCEDURE: Mr. Kreifels was to undergo a possible multivalve
coronary artery bypass graft today. After anesthesia, the
patient was having an left internal jugular vein Swan Ganz
introducer catheter placed using the Seldinger technique by
anesthesia. After confirmation of placing the wire into the
superior vena cava they were unable to pass the dilator.
Upon withdrawal of the dilator, brisk red blood was coming
out the small skin incision that appeared to be pulsatile.
Immediately direct pressure was applied and an intraoperative
vascular surgery consult was obtained. It took approximately
25 to 30 minutes for pressure to achieve excellent
hemostasis.

Intraoperative Duplex ultrasound of the carotid showed
antegrade flow with a very small low flow left carotid to
left internal jugular vein fistula. It was felt by the
vascular surgeon that this would probably thrombose on its
own and would be re-evaluated within the next day.

Given the nature of the injury and the patient being a
vasculopath, we elected to obtain a neurology consult as well
as attempt to wake the patient up. After reversal of the
chemical paralysis and sedation, the patient did in fact move
all of his extremity to command and perform complex tasks.
The patient was therefore extubated and appeared to be
neurologically intact.

AtKreifelstime the case was cancelled and the patient will be
brought back to the intensive care unit for critical
monitoring of all organ systems. Dr. 123 Any St.es) **] was present
and participated throughout all significant portions of his
preoperative care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted on 2009-01-25 00:00:00 he had been scheduled earlier however with
central line placement there was the creation of an av fistula
by anesthesis causing case to be delayed. General Calynn Blomeke eval was
obtained for toxic goiter and combination of thyroid and
CABG,/Calynn Blomeke was planned, endocrine evaluation was obtained and
recommendations were followed regarding calcium monitoring and
supplementation.
2009-01-25 00:00:00 CABGx3, 2009-01-25 00:00:00/ thyroidectomy performed and in post op period
there was some concern over CVA, because of left hand weakness,
Imaging and neurologic consultation revealed this to be a
re-manifestation of an old stroke that resoved with time, , Pt
was extubated 2009-01-25 00:00:00 and started on Keppra for neurologic
protection, MRI of brain was performed, in CU had ARF with
elevation of creatinine, pt was subsequently reintubated Drips
and natrecor were D/C'ed 112/29 pt was extubated and
intermittently folowing commands, 2009-01-25 00:00:00 thoracentisis was
performed for effusion,, 2009-01-25 00:00:00 wide complex tachycaria ensued,,
Vent dependent Respiratory failure occurred, was intermittendly
in a flutter in unit in earlyt 2009-01-25 00:00:00 controlled with
medications and evaluated by EPS and Kreifels recommendations were
followed. Finally 2009-01-25 00:00:00 pt was extubated and failed multiple
swallow studies, and pt was cathed on 2009-01-25 00:00:00 for post void
residual, Pt mental stutus cleared and no residul defecots
occurred neurologically just chronic debilitation. Pt was
re-evaluated for swallowing and again failed, pt developed LLL
infiltrate, Pt had IR post pyloric tube placed 2009-01-25 00:00:00 for
feeding, and eventually had PEG placed 2009-01-25 00:00:00. and PICC placed
2009-01-25 00:00:00. Pt was screened for rehab and was D/C to rehad in stable
condition
