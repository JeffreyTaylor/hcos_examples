HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male with
a 5-year history of a large right lobe cavernous hemangioma.
He was admitted to UPMCE on
2007-06-10 00:00:00 after experiencing the subacute onset of fevers,
time to have had a intrahepatic mass bleed requiring 2 units
of packed red blood cells.  He stabilized and sent home for
the weekend with plans to come back on 2007-06-10 00:00:00 to undergo the
resection of this hemangioma which had now become unstable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history significant for
hypercholesterolemia which has since resolved.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination at the
time of admission revealed his lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
His extremities were warm and well perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the General
Surgical Service on 2007-06-10 00:00:00.  Initial laboratory values
at that time demonstrated a hematocrit of 34.2, an alkaline
phosphatase of 559, and a total bilirubin of 2.  The rest of
his laboratories were unremarkable.

On 2007-06-10 00:00:00, the patient underwent an uncomplicated resection
of the hemangioma of his right hepatic lobe with minimal
resection of the liver parenchyma itself.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

Overnight, the patient was recovered in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit predominantly because of a 5.5-liter
blood loss intraoperative.  He remained intubated until
postoperative day one at which time he was extubated without
difficulty.

He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day one and
had an uneventful postoperative course thereafter.  He
continued to have low-grade fevers postoperatively, but by
the day of discharge had remained afebrile for greater than
24 hours.

On postoperative day four, the patient passed flatus and had
a bowel movement, and his diet was advanced without
difficulty.  His urine output had remained more than adequate
throughout his hospital stay.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on postoperative day three.  His total bilirubin
rose to 8 on the day of operation but continued to trend
downward to 2 on postoperative day four.  His hematocrit had
dropped to 29 postoperatively after resuscitation and blood
products.  On the day of discharge, his hematocrit has
stabilized at around 27.  The pathology on the specimen was
positive only for hemangioma with areas of infarct.  He had a
blood culture from 2007-06-10 00:00:00 that grew out 1/4 bottles positive
for guaiac-negative Staphylococcus; consistent with a skin
contaminant and was not treated for such.

On the day of discharge, the patient had remained afebrile,
was tolerating a regular diet, was voiding freely with normal
bowel movements, and having his pain controlled on oral
myelodysplastic syndrome.  On the day of admission, the
lateral 123 Any St.-123 Any St. drain was removed.  The medial drain
was left in place.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was restarted on all
of his preadmission medications with the inclusion of
Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart had a regular
rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His belly
was soft and nondistended with mild incisional tenderness
along the Chevron incision.  The wound was clean, dry, and
intact.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right hepatic lobe hemangioma, status
post resection and cholecystectomy.
