Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma surgery service on
2007-03-13 00:00:00 after a syncopal episode causing a fall down stairs
resulting in multiple broken ribs, but no other injuries.

Neuro: Pain control was [**Last Name **] problem for this patient during her
hospitalization and the acute pain service was consulted to
provide recommendations to better manage the patient's rib pain.
She initially received IV pain medicaions, including a PCA, and
also had a paravertebral block performed by APS. When tolerating
oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain
medications, on a regimen including neurontin, lidoderm patch,
standing tylenol, tramadol and dilaudid for break-through pain,
with fair pain control. The pt also underwent carotid duplex
ultrasound in the evaluation for syncope, which showed 60-69%
stenosis of L ICA, 40-59% stenosis of R ICA. She will follow up
with vascular surgery in 6 months for this, but this is not
likely the cause of her syncope.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. She was kept on telemetry
which was reassuring. ECG on admission was not thought to be
consistent with STEMI. Additionally, cardiac enzymes were
negative x 1. Vital signs were routinely monitored and were
stable. She needs follow up with her regular doctor, as she may
need an echo or holter monitoring as an out-patient.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. She did require 2L of O2
nasal cannula at discharge, this was thought to be due to poor
deep breathing 2007-03-13 00:00:00 mild persistent rib pain. Chest xrays did not
reveal any pneumonia or fluid overload. The pt did have a 1.5 cm
left lower lobe pulmonary nodule noted on CT chest. She will
need follow up by her regular doctor, likely with repeat CT
chest to eval for interval change.

GI/GU: At admission, the patient was resuscitated with IV fluids
until tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when
appropriate, which was tolerated well. She was also started on a
bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on
HD#2. Intake and output were closely monitored and were normal.
She did have some episodes of incontinence.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible with PT.

At the time of discharge on HD#7, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
working with PT, voiding without assistance, and pain was fairly
well controlled.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
Newbridge on the Eran Porton

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: 1) fall (trauma), 2) syncope, 3) right posterior 2007-03-13 00:00:00
rib fractures, 4) right anterior 6th rib fx

Secondary:  1) atrial fibrillation, 2) Osteoporosis, 3) diabetes
mellitus II, 4) PE 20 years ago, 5) [** Location **]us C7 fx


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status:Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive
Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair


Discharge Instructions:
*You were admitted to UPMCE to the trauma service after a fall
due to losing consciousness.
*You were found to have 5 rib fractures on CT scan. The most
important treatment for this kind of fracture is pain control to
optimize deep breathing. There is no surgery or brace for
support that is recommended. Optimization of pain control is
imperative because splinting (weak breathing due to pain) can
result in pneumonia.
* You should expect to have rib pain for 4-6 weeks from your
injury until your ribs have begun to heal. Please continue to
take the pain medication prescribed until then. Please also
continue to use the incentive spirometer (breathing machine) 10
times per hour in order to keep your lungs adequately inflated
(like a balloon).
* You had CT scan of your head, neck, abdomen and pelvis which
revealed no other injuries. CT scan of the chest did show a
small nodule in your left lung. You should follow up with your
regular doctor to discuss imaging the lung in several months
evaluate for growth.
* In evaluation for your loss of consciousness, we did blood
tests that look at heart strain or decreased blood flow
(troponins) which were normal.  Additionally you were kept on
telemetry (continuous heart monitoring) which was reassuring.
Finally, you underwent an ultrasound study of your carotids,
which showed some degree of narrowing but not narrowing
significant enough to have caused your syncopal episodes.  You
need to follow up with vascular surgery Dr. Covey in 6 months
for this.  You may also need additional evaluation for heart
monitoring, and should follow up with your regular doctor to
discuss this.

Please call your doctor, talk to your doctor at rehab or return
to the ER if:
* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your
medications.
* If you have shaking chills, fever greater than 101.5 (F)
degrees or 38 (C) degrees, chest pain, cough, shortness of
breath, or anything else that is troubling you.
* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that
concern you.
* Please resume all regular home medications and take any new
meds as ordered.
* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking any
narcotic pain medication. You may have constipation when taking
narcotic pain medications (oxycodone, percocet, vicodin,
hydrocodone, dilaudid, etc.); you should continue drinking
fluids, you may take stool softeners, and should eat foods that
are high in fiber.


Followup Instructions:
Call Dr.Almudena Covey office for a follow up appointment in 6
months, tell them that you will need carotid ultrasound prior to
appointment.
Phone: test@mail.com.

Please also follow up with Dr. Covey in 2007-03-13 00:00:00 weeks.  Call (test@mail.com for an appointment.

Please let your regular doctor know about this hospitalization
and follow up with him or her in 2007-03-13 00:00:00 weeks.  You may need
additional monitoring of your heart rhythm.
