CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Expanding infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male with a known 6.5 x 5.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm, who presented to the emergency department after
experiencing weakness and diaphoresis while at his dentist's
office.  He was also complaining of severe bilateral lower
extremity claudication and back pain for two weeks.  He took
nitroglycerin at the dentist's office with some relief and
was sent to the emergency department for evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarctions in 2009-10-09 00:00:00, 2009-10-09 00:00:00, and 2009-10-09 00:00:00.
2.  Cerebrovascular accident.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 6.5 x 5.5 cm.

ALLERGIES:  None known.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Toprol 300 mg qd
2.  Lipitor 10 mg qd
3.  Imdur 120 mg qd
4.  Vioxx 25 mg qd
5.  Norvasc 25 mg qd
6.  Pepcid 20 mg qd
7.  Singulair 10 mg
8.  .............. 100 mg b.i.d.
9.  Lasix 20 mg qd
10. Allopurinol 100 mg qd
11. .............. 60 mg qd
12. Trental 400 mg t.i.d.
13. Zoloft 25 mg qd
14. Antivert 12.5 mg qd
15. Flovent 10 mg

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 138/88,
heart rate 72 and irregular, 98% on two liters.  General
Exam:  Obese male.  HEENT:  EOMI.  MMM.  Cardiovascular:
Irregular heart rate.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, tender.  Pulsatile mass.
Rectal:  Guaiac negative, normal tone.  Extremities:
Palpable radials, left femoral, left popliteal, left dorsalis
pedis, left posterior tibial palpable.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  Chemistries showed sodium 144, potassium
4.6, chloride 108, bicarbonate 22, BUN 31, creatinine 1.9,
glucose 121.  CBC showed hematocrit 44.5, white cell count
11.3, platelets 175,000.  Coagulations:  PT 13.1, PTT 6.1,
INR 1.1

Electrocardiogram on admission showed atrial fibrillation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was diagnosed as having an
expanding infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and was
admitted to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit, VICU, for
monitoring and preparation for surgery on the following day.
A Cardiology consult was obtained, and they recommended
short-acting beta blocker therapy.

On 2009-10-09 00:00:00 he underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm
resection with oversewing of the left CIA, ligation of right
CIA, aortobifemoral with profunda bypass with bifurcated
Dacron graft.  Postoperatively he remained intubated for
hemodynamic monitoring and was transferred to the PACU and
started on Lopressor drip.

On postoperative day #1 he was extubated and transferred to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.  On
postoperative day #1 his urine output was low, and he was
diagnosed as having ATN and seemed to be fluid overloaded.
He responded to Lasix.  It was also noted that his cardiac
enzymes were elevated, and he was ruled in with a non-Q wave
MI.  He was then started on Cardiology recommendations on
aspirin and continued beta blockade.

He was relatively stable over the next couple of days,
although he was requiring blood transfusions on a frequent
basis.  Postoperative echocardiogram on 2009-10-09 00:00:00 revealed an
EF of less than 25% (preoperatively about 35%) and global
hypokinesis of the left ventricle, mild pulmonary
hypertension, 1+ mitral regurgitation.

He continued to be in the Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring of his renal function and his respiratory function
and cardiac status.

On 2009-10-09 00:00:00 he showed signs of respiratory distress and had to
be reintubated.  Subsequently, his Intensive Care course was
complicated by ARDS, recurrence of the renal failure, and the
need for vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure.

He continued to do poorly, though every effort was made to
stabilize him, including cardioversion for his atrial
fibrillation and also DVVHD for his renal failure.  He
continued to deteriorate, needing increasing ventilatory and
vasopressor support.  An Infectious Disease consult was
obtained, which concurred with the diagnosis of sepsis.  He
continued to be on Levophed, Dopamine, and Neo-Synephrine
drips to maintain his blood pressure.

On 2009-10-09 00:00:00, after discussion with the family, the
vasopressors were withdrawn and he expired after sustaining
an asystolic cardiac arrest.
