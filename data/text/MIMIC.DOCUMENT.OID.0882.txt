Chief Complaint:
hematuria, weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83-year old Russian-speaking male with a past
medical history of IDDM, asthma, AFib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG

in 2009-05-17 00:00:00, diabetic ulcers, chronic venous stasis dematitis/severe

lower extremity edema follwoed by vascular service presenting
with hematuria, shaking in his R arm and hypotension and
tachycarida noted in the ED. History was obtained from son and
wife, who speak English, and are patient's primary caretakers.
Adebola Cramer has been declining since around 2009-05-17 00:00:00; used to be able to
walk around and now needs assistance to transfer from bed to
chair, and has been mostly wheelchair bound. Patient was last
admitted in 2009-05-17 00:00:00 for cellulitis in setting of his chronic lower
extremity edema. At that time he was experiencing shakes at
home, high fevers and on admission was noted to have L lower
extremity erythema. He was treated with a course of IV abx at
home (including course of zosyn, ceftriaxone for E. coli
bacteremia). He also was referred to podiatry and conservative
measures such as wound care, leg elevation and ACE wraps have
been used by his wife in order to decrease his chance of
infection, however he still has significant lower extremity
edema bilaterally.
.
Yesterday, his wife noted that the patient was urinating more
and then had bright red urine. He had never had this before. He
had associated L sided abdominal pain. Today he had a scheduled
podiatry followup appointment for wound debridement. No
purulence or drainage was noted from ulcers. Developed shaking
chills after this appointment and presented to the ED for chills
and for hematuria as his primary complaints. No fevers,
diarrhea, chest pain. He has had a dry cough, but this is
chronic and has been getting better (per family, related to
difficulty swallowing bt this has improved). Has also been
constipatied and his wife (who is a nurse and his primary
caretaker) manually disimpacted him on Saturday.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.8 131 88/45 18 95% RA. He
triggered soon after arrival for systolic BP in 80s and HR in
130s, and responded immediately to fluids. Baseline BP per the
wife who records multiple times per day is 80s-100s systolic.
Recieved vancomycin and zosyn after obtaining blood and urine cx
for concern for PNA with retrocardiac opacity noted on CXR. He
was also noted to have hematuria, foley cathter was placed and
initially urine was red with clots, but then ran clear wtihout
irrigation. Noted to have Cr elevated from baseline at 2.2,
microcytic anemia and INR 1.6 (on coumadin for Afib). Also
notedt o have transaminitis (AST 314, ALT 322), however specimen
was hemolyzed. VS on transfer afebrile, HR 87, 112/59, 22 100%
on RA. EKG with bundle branch block (old) and afib.

CHEST (PA & LAT) 2009-05-17 00:00:00:
Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion. Recommend repeat
radiograph
after diuresis to assess for resolution of retrocardiac
opacities which could represent LLL pneumonia.

Abdominal u/s 2009-05-17 00:00:00:
1. Main portal vein is patent.
2. Bilateral kidneys show evidence of thinning of the cortex.
3. Gallbladder wall thickening with mild gallbladder wall edema
likely
represents third spacing in setting of congestive cardiac
failure.
4. Small amount of ascites.
5. Splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo M with IDDM, asthma, AFib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG in
2009-05-17 00:00:00, diabetic ulcers, chronic venous stasis dematitis/severe
lower extremity edema followed by vascular service p/w hematuria
x 2 days and chills, hypotension and tachycardia following a
podiatry appointment for wound debridement.

Chills, hypotension and tachycardia was due to probable UTI with
urine culture growth of E coli. He completed 7 total days of
appropriate antibiotic therapy. It seems as though his
hypotension was a baseline blood pressure (at home per wife SBP
80-100) and his tachycardia was the major issue. Due to a h/o
bradycardia his nodal agents had been held.  His toprol and
digoxin at low doses were restarted and his amiodarone 400mg po
daily was continued. His tachycardia resolved, his BP remained
80-100 systolic and was asymptomatic.

PERIPHERAL EDEMA, associated with ascites and pleural effusions:
all consistent with acute on chronic right sided heart failure.
he was restarted on his home dose of torsemide and diuresed
about net negative 2 liters the first day wtih clinical
improvement in volume status. It is possible he has a greater PO
fluid / salt intake at home or does not take his torsemide as
prescribed but he responded well to this dose. His I/O's were
even over the next 24 hours.  He will continue on this but
should be weighed daily at home and his torsemide should be
adjusted based on his edema, weight and BUN/Cr.

CKD 3: creatinine remained stable around at baseline through
diuresis.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: As above restarted on nodal agents with
good effect. Coumadin continued at 2.5mg po daily with
therapeutic INR.

DM1 uncontrolled with renal and PVD comps, chronic diabetic foot
ulcer. The patient continued on his insulin regimen and will
follow-up with podiatry for further care.

DECREASED MOBILITY: subacute decline in mobility, patient has
been walking much less with a walker at home per his wife, PT
evaluated the patient and recommended rehab, which he and his
wife refused (as she had a bad experience involving the
development of pressure sores in the past) and instead PT
recommended he stay for 2009-05-17 00:00:00 inpt PT sessions then be discharged
home w/ PT and VNA.
