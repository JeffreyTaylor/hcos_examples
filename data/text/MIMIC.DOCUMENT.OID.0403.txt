Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo M with h/o PD and asp pna, who presented to OSH with SOB,
fever, rigors, LLL infiltrate and UTI.
.
1. SOB/Pneumonia: CXR showed heterogeneous opacification at the
lung bases c/w aspiration pneumonia and given his history of
aspiration, this seems the most likely cause of his SOB.  His
WBC count was elevated to 22 on admission with a 12% bandemia.
He was initially started on zosyn and vancomycin, but remained
afebrile with stable wbc and O2 sats on zosyn only.  He
completed a total 10 days of antibiotics.  He continues on his
standing UPMCE theravest treatments for aggressive pulmonary
toilet.  Family requested referral to pulmonary clinic for
continued recommendations on use of theravest and avoidance of
recurrent pneumonias.
.
2. Sepsis: Had elevated WBC, source of infection, elevated RR,
and fever to 103, meeting criteria for sepsis.  He was initially
hypertensive at UPMCE where he received lasix. BP was
borderline on admission to UPMCE and he subsequently required
IVF boluses to maintain MAP > 60.  Cosyntropin stim revealed
cortisol of 17.6-->31.2.  He will be treated for his pneumonia,
as above.  Sputum culture was contaminated with OP flora, blood
cultures were negative, and urine culture only grew Giacomin Bieler.
.
3. Parkinson's: He was continued on sinemet, entacapone, and
pramipexole.
.
4. Glaucoma: His home eye drops were continued.
.
5. FEN: Has G tube, but occasionally takes PO at home.  He has
been recommended a soft solid diet in the past.  Video

nectar thickened liquids without aspiration.  However, patient
wished to defer his ground diet, as it is not a123 Any St.ing to him.

needs.
.
