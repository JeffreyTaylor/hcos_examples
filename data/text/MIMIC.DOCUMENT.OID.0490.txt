History of Present Illness:
76M complicated past medical history including CAD status post
CABG, s/p stents 2007-01-25 00:00:00/2007-01-25 00:00:00 (on aspirin and plavix), status post
biologic AVR, CHF with EF 35-40 %, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on coumadin (now off secondary to recent epistaxis
requiring blood transfusion), history of strokes, CKD (baseline
Cr 2.5) with recent kidney injury thought to be secondary to AIN
from naficllin requiring hemodialysis, now off. He presented to
UPMCE with lethargy. Patient states that he awoke this
morning feeling unwell. He had no specific or localizing signs.

He was recently discharged from UPMCE on the UPMCE Rehab
Facility 3 days prior to presentation. He had been there since
an admission to UPMCE for MSSA bacteremia complicated by what
appears to be acute kidney injury from acute interstitial
nephritis thought to be secondary to nafcillin. He also
developed diffuse skin vasculitis at that time.  He had been on
steroids which had been tapered to off about 2 weeks ago.  He
has also had intermittent delirium and volume overload.  It
appears an NSTEMI also complicated his course.

He had an episode of epistaxis for which he was admitted to
UPMCE from 2007-01-25 00:00:00 to 2007-01-25 00:00:00 with an INR greater than 10 at the
time.  He is no longer on Coumadin but he is on aspirin and
Plavix.  He has had no further bleeding.  He has also had recent
transaminitis thought to be secondary to amiodarone and statin.
He had had a right upper quadrant ultrasounds which did not
reveal acute cholecystitis but did show gallstones in the
gallbladder.  His amiodarone has been discontinued but it
appears he is back on his simvastatin.

At UPMCE, the patient complained of pain in his penis from
Foley catheter insertion in the emergency department.

He denies shortness of breath, fever, chills, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain.  He notes a mild
nonproductive cough over the last few days.  He reports his
white blood cell count has been elevated intermittently in the
past.  It was elevated at NewBridge; however, repeat was normal
and he was sent home.

Per his wife he had an episode of confusion in the morning with
some
urinary incontinence.  He is now back at his baseline.  He is
AAOx3.

It was also noted that he has had recent increase in lower
extremity edema which was thought to be secondary to his
prednisone. His lasix was increased to 80 mg PO BID from 40 mg
PO BID about a week and a half ago. His lower extremities have
improved in terms of swelling. He also reports improvement of
the vasculitic rash now scabbing.

For his diabetes, his lantus was recently increased from 22
units to 26 units as he has been having elevated blood glucose
which began at NewBridge on the Jabrandon Cayler.

In the ER at UPMCE, he was found to have acute renal
injury with Cr of 3.1 (baseline ~ 2.5) as well as hyperkalemia
(K 6.1). He was treated with 8 units of IV insulin, Kayexalate,
and calcium gluconate. He was also given 2.5 L of IVF per
records.

CXR was felt to show possible left lower infiltrate. He was
given levofloxacin and vancomycin.

Studies were significant for:

Na 132 K 6.1, Cl 99, HCO3 26, BUN 71, Cr 3.1, Glc 355

epi
EKG: NSR at 77 bpm, PR prolongation, RBBB. No acute ST-T changes

CXR: Poor quality. Increased density in inferior portion of
chest on lateral view likely represents pleural fluid, probably
on the right, prominent cardiac silhouette
Head CT (123 Any St.): Left maxillary sinus disease. No acute
intracranial pathology.
RUQ US (123 Any St.): No Jabrandon Cayler sign. No pericholecystic fluid.
STones in neck of gallbladder. Gallbladder wall distended at 5
mm and had been 3 mm. No dilated ducts.

There was concern given leukocytosis and CXR showing ? pneumonia
and his new onset renal failure.

Given elevated LFTS, a RUQ US was performed that showed 5 mm
gallbladder wall (up from 3 mm two weeks ago) with stones in the
neck of the gallbladder. There was no sonEun Inserra Eun Inserra sign.
Flagyl was subsequently added for broader coverage. A surgery
consult was called in the ER for aforementioned findings. The
impression was that although the patient has no abdominal
tenderness that given his diabetes his clinical exam may be
altered. His leukocytosis may be secondary to ? developing
pneumonia; however, his gallbladder wall is thickened and the
patient will likely require percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
His LFTs are difficult to interpret in context of acute illness,
and his CBD is not dilated.

He was transferred from 123 Any St. for ? cholecystitis for
potential surgical procedure.

VS on transfer were T 98.2, BP 126/68, HR 74, RR 17, pOx 98 % RA
Urine output 475 mL
.
In the UPMCE ED inital vitals were, 17:57 97.0 74 113/60 20 100%
2L Nasal Cannula.

Labs in UPMCE ER showed Na 137, K 5.4, Cl 104, HCO3 20, Lactate
2.6, Glc 271. Hgb was 10.

A general surgery consult was called in the ER. Impression was
admission to medicine with monitoring of LFTs and serial
abdominal exams. A percutaneous chole tube was not advised at
this time.

VS on transfer: AF, HR 74, BP 139/67, RR 22, pOx 100 % 3L

On arrival to the ICU, patient was initially sleepy, but then
awoke and wanted a piece of toast - which was given after
explaining that it would be optimal if he remained NPO given
concern for gallbladder process.

                            **FINAL REPORT 2007-01-25 00:00:00**

   CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final 2007-01-25 00:00:00):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      212 AU/ML.
      Reference Range:  Negative < 4 AU/ml, Positive >= 6 AU/ml.


   CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final 2007-01-25 00:00:00):
      POSITIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
      BORDERLINE POSITIVE.
      INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
      A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
      Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may
reactivate
      when immunity is compromised.
      Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >2007-01-25 00:00:00 mg/dl
may cause
      interference with CMV IgM results.
      Interpret IgM result with caution; liver disease,
autoimmune and
      lymphoproliferative diseases may cause false positive
results.

2007-01-25 00:00:00 04:16PM BLOOD PT-17.3* PTT-33.8 INR(PT)-1.6*

Brief Hospital Course:
76M CAD s/p CABG and PCI with stents placed a few months ago,
systolic CHF, pAF, CKD III, and DM2, presenting with lethargy,
acute renal failure, pneumonia and possible  cholecystitis.
.
# Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
Patient had episode of brief confusion this AM. Per prior
medical records, patient can sometimes be confused. DDx includes
toxic-metabolic process in setting of renal dysfunction,
infectious process, or primary neurogenic process among others.
Latter unlikely given negative head CT and non-focal neuro exam.
Favor metabolic encephalopathy. On admission, patient AAOx3. His
mental status remained intact for the remainder of the
hospitalization.
.
# Leukocytosis/HCAP-
Patient presented with leukocytosis to 16.6 with neutrophilia on
differential. He was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and
appeared to be perfusing well in the ICU. No adrenergic state or
recent steroids to explain elevated white count. There was
concern for infectious etiology given cough and evidence of PNA
with HCAP risk and initially ? cholecystitis in setting of
cholestatic LFTs (However, HIDA-limited study returned negative
and abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis not
cholecystitis. Lactate was initially elevated at 2.7 initially
at BIDN s/p IVF with admission lactate 1.3. Initially, he was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including aztreonam,
flagyl, and vancomycin for both pulmonary and GI process.
Aztreonam was later switched to ciprofloxacin. The clinical
picture overall was consistent with HCAP but not acute
cholecystitis as pt did not have any abdominal pain. He
clinically improved and was transferred to the floor on 2007-01-25 00:00:00. He
spiked a temperature to 100.9 with leukocytosis to 20K.
Ciprofloxacin was switched to cefepime to optimize gram negative
coverage. He defervesced, leukocytosis improved, and oxygen was
weaned to room air for which he remained. Final antibiotic
regimen is IV vanco/cefepime/flagyl x8 total days. Vanco and
flagyl to end on 2007-01-25 00:00:00 and cefepime to end on 2007-01-25 00:00:00. PICC line was
placed and can be removed after antibiotic course is complete.
.
# Transaminitis
He has had elevated LFTs in past thought to be drug-induced from
amiodarone and atorvastatin (which were held) in outpatient
setting. Pattern appeared to be both hepatocellular and
cholestatic concerning for aforementioned gallbladder process
with uncharacterized liver disease. Hepatitis viral serologies
were sent and were negative. HIDA scan was limited but,
unremarkable. RUQ US with doppler was negative. Off the statin,
the transaminases improved, and this was thought to be the most
likely etiology. Statin was not resumed during admission, but
this can be considered after further outpatient monitoring
especially given recent stent placement. Pt did not have any
abdominal pain while on the medical floor.
.
# Acute renal failure on CKD. New baseline appears to be ~2.3.
Range was 2.3-2.7 during admission.Attributed to increased lasix
dosage (80mg UPMCE from 40mg UPMCE) over past few weeks as well as
poor PO intake. FeUREA on admission 34%, also consistent with
pre-renal process. Recently, pt had AIN from nafcillin and had
to be temporarily dialyzed. He also received and completed a
course of prednisone therapy prior to admission. Cr ranged from
2.3-2.7 during admission and was 2.3 on day of discharge. Pt
should have his creatinine monitored daily while on antibiotic
therapy including vanco and cefepime. Of note, the renal team
monitored the patient closely during admission. His lasix was
restarted at 20mg daily on 2007-01-25 00:00:00 given evidence of CHF seen on CXR
as well as slightly increased peripheral edema. Pt was not
hypoxic. Renal follow up arranged for 2 weeks after discharge.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: Compensated during admission.
BB dose was decreased to 50mg metoprolol UPMCE. Lasix was
restarted on 2007-01-25 00:00:00 at 20mg daily. Had been held recently due to
ARF. Pt is not on an ACEI presumable due to recent ARF/AIN. 2007-01-25 00:00:00
consider in the future should Cr stabilize. Would follow I/o's
and daily weights closely and uptitrate lasix prn pending
creatinine values.
.
# atrial fibrillation: Pt with pacemaker. Pt was placed on 50mg
UPMCE metoprolol during admission with well controlled HR
(initially held given concern for sepsis). Pt with recent
history of significant epistaxis vs. hemoptysis 2007-01-25 00:00:00 per OSH
reports. Warfarin was restarted on 2.4 as his risk of CVA
currently outweighs risk of bleeding. Pt was given 2.5mg daily.
INR's remained subtherapeutic. INR 1.6 on day of discharge.
Warfarin can be continually uptitrated prn after discharge. He
was not given bridging therapy given the recent history of
bleeding.
.
# CAD, s/p prior CABG and DES x2 in 2007-01-25 00:00:00: stable. BB was
restarted with discharge dose of 50mg UPMCE metoprolol. Pt was
continued on asa and plavix. Statin was held given
transaminitis. This may be able to be restarted in outpatient
setting after close monitoring of LFTs. An appointment with Dr.
123 Any St. was made prior to discharge.
.
#HTN-continued BB.
.
# DM II uncontrolled with complications: Glucose was monitored
closely, and once he was taking good po on the medical floor, he
sometimes refused insulin and became markedly hyperglycemic.
Lantus insulin dose was increased to 30U, and he was maintained
on a Humalog sliding scale. See attached.
.
# Anemia: chronic disease, stable Hct. Pt can continue PO iron
UPMCE as per outpatient regimen. HCT on discharge 29.3. Baseline
appears to be between 27-30. Further outpatient work up, such as
colonscopy, can be considered prn.
.
# BPH: stable on outpatient medications

# Hypothyroidism: continued synthyroid.

# ??History of strokes: resumed warfarin as noted above

# Skin impairment: Patient has notable skin impairment on
bilateral feet, also ? stage II decubitus ulcer. Wound care team
was consulted and made helpful recommendations.

# CODE STATUS: Was DNR/DNI on admission, but while in the Eun Inserra,
pt changed code status to Full Code. This can be continually
addressed upon discharge. Pt expressed frustration with frequent
admissions and rehab stays.
