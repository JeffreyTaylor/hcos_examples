Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Binnie Pesak
Chief Complaint:
Headache, malaise, nausea, disorientation

Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 year old gentleman with chronic hypocapnia, central
sleep apnea, episodic hyperventilati, onorthostatic hypotension,
and autonomic dysfunction who is suspected to have a syndrome
related either to mitochondrial disease, channelopathy, or an
uncharacterized metabolic pathway disturbance.  He presented to
the ED after a particularly severe episode of his chronic
hypocapnia.   These episodes have been going on for eleven years
and have been characterized by nausea, headache, malaise and
lightheadedness.  Particularly bad episodes  will lead to frank
disorientation, as this one did.   The patient monitors his
end-tidal CO2 at home and his urinary pH.   He reports that,
when his end-tidal CO2 is low or his pH is not sufficiently
alkalemic, he tends to get these episodes.
The only treatment that seems to have helped his symptoms
consistently is bicarbonate replacement.

On consultation with his sleep physician, Krauss. Binnie Pesak, it
was decided that, given his uncharacterized syndrome, he would
be admitted to the MICU for intensive monitoring of his blood
gas and chemistries to further define the biochemical nature of
his syndrome.  This originally was to have occurred next week.
He, however, had another episode of his hypocapneic syndrome
yesterday while vacationing in 123 Any St..  He was disoriented for
two hours. Home test of end-tidal CO2 during a hyperventilation
episode was in the 20's.  His wife Amista Krauss Dr. Binnie Pesak 6 hours
prior to admission and it was decided he should fly back to
123 Any St. and present to the ED for admission to the MICU.

In the ED, initial vital signs T 99.7 P 94 BP 111/67 O2 97 on
2L.  He was nauseated but no longer disoriented.  He had taken
bicarbonate last about 8 hours 123 Any St.usly.  A VBG revealed
7.41/25/147/16.  Bicarb was on chemistries which were otherwise
unremarkable He received zofran for nausea as well as one liter
IVF.

On presentation to MICU the patient reports his still feels his
usual symptoms of nausea, headache and lightheadedness.  He
denies fevers or sick contacts.  Amista Krauss traveled to 123 Any St. last
week and does report his symptoms worsen with altitude or with
air travel.

Brief Hospital Course:
55-year-old gentleman with chronic hypocapnic syndrome, central
apnea of unclear etiology believed to have an undefined
metabolic, mitochondrial, or channel-related syndrome.

1) Hypocapnic syndrome, unknown etiology for past 11 years.  No
interventions currently beyond bicarbonate therapy.  123 Any St.usly
seen by many specialists including endocrine and renal.
Initially admitted to gather data x 48 hours.  While inpatient
ABGs, electrolytes and urine electrolytes were collected every 2
hours x 24 hours, then every 4 hours x 24 hours.  The only
ap123 Any St.ble intervention in his respiratory alkalosis was
improvement after oxycodone administration for a severe
headache. We also sent serum metanephrines, urine metanephrines,
and 24 HOUR urine 5-HIAA which were pending upon discharge.  LP
performed, pH reported as 7.7 with protein of 83, ammonia sent
out.  His CSF pH is unexplained, and may be artifactual.
Following his LP, we attempted collection of ABGs while patient
was using his CO2-rebreather device.  Mr. Krauss, however, was
unable to tolerate the attempt.  After discussion of an overall
plan for diagnosis, he was discharged with follow-up for further
evaluation, as well as prescriptions for oxycodone and
ondansetron given that these were the only medications that
provided symptomatic benefit and ABG improvement during his
inpatient stay.

2) Orthostasis, long standing.  Not an active problem while
inpatient, no intervention pursued.

3) Concern for potassium wasting syndrome, very high urine K and
persistent hypokalemia.  Potassium was monitored while inpatient
and was never below 3.5.

4) CAD, no symptoms of ischemia.  Known history of CAD s/p PCI
to OM2.  Was continued on propanol and vytorin while inpatient.
He probably needs to restart his ACE-I, but this was deferred to
outpatient management.

5) Tremor.  Not an active inpatient issue.  Was continued on
propranolol while inpatient.

6) Mood disorder.  During inpatient stay he was intermittently
very anxious with pressured speech.  Expressed great frustration
about the lack of answers concerning his acid-base
abnormalities.  SW was consulted to help with patient coping
while in the hospital.  He was also continued on Topamax and PRN
Ativan.

7) Hypogonadism.  Continued on outpatient Androgel.  As this is
a nonformulary medication, he took his own medication while
inpatient.

1) Clonazepam 1.5 daily,
2) Vytorin combined ezetimibe 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg daily,
