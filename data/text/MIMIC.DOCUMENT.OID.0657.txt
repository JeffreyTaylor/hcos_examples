Headache & vomiting

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 year old woman with hx of breast CA, TIA's and
CAD s/p CABG, and R cavernous carotid aneurysm s/p clipping,
transferred from UPMCE after having been found to have
intracerebral hemorrhage.
Last night around 7 pm she was alone at home (lives in a
retirement community) and developed headache, dizziness, nausea
and vomiting. She also had some diarrhea and thought that she
had
a viral illness. Went to bed, difficulty sleeping because of her
vomiting. This morning she still felt dizzy and weak. Her son
came to visit her later in the morning and noted a prominent R
facial droop and slurred speech. He took her to UPMCE where a CT was performed that was concerning for
subarachnoid blood. She was sent to UPMCE for further
evaluation.
In ED, repeat CT performed that showed hypodensity in R anterior
frontal lobe c/w subacute or acute infarct, with 2x2 cm
intraparenchymal hemorrage in posterior portion of the infarct
wtih minimal subarachnoid extension. She is admitted for further
management and evaluation.

ROS:
Negative for recent falls, head or neck trauma, change in mental
status, fevers, recent travel, rash, sick contacts. Pt says that
today she feels tired and has some unsteadiness when she walks.
Also thinks that her L arm is a bit weaker than the right.

Pertinent Results:
cbc: 8.5>36<290
lytes; 142/3.7/105/25/10/0.8<102
PT/INR/PTT: 13/25.2/1.1

Head CT 2008-12-02 00:00:00:
Large wedge-shaped area of low attenuation in the right frontal
lobe, likely consistent with an acute/subacute infarction, with
associated focus of intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage
at the superior most aspect.

Chest CT with contrast 2008-12-02 00:00:00:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Post surgical changes with rightward shift of the
mediastinum.
3) No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.

Head CT with contrast:
Essentially stable subacute hemorrhage within the right frontal
lobe with surrounding edema, but no further mass effect. No
enhancing masses identified. Old left subcortical hypodensity
suggestive of prior infarction. Unremarkable CT angiogram with
no regions of stenosis, aneurysmal dilatation, or arterial
venous malformations seen. Status post aneurysmal clipping along
the right internal carotid artery with distoring artifact.

Carotid US:
Mild plaque in the bilateral carotid arteries at the level of
the neck, without significant associated stenosis (less than 40%
reduction in diameter on each side).

ECHO (TTE):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The interatrial septum is dynamic, but not
frankly aneurysmal. A patent foramen ovale is present with
right-to-left flow of saline contrast post-Valsalva release.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with at least mild
mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Positive saline contrast study with maneurvers c/w
patent foramen ovale. Preserved global biventricular systolic
function. At least mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of her right frontal
infarct with a hemorrhagic transformation.  We obtained carotid
studies which did not show any stenosis and we obtained a TTE
which did show a PFO.  A subsequent lower ext. doppler did not
reveal any source of dvt.  The patient went into a rapid afib
during the first hospital night.  Cardiology was consulted and
felt we should attempt to rhythm control her with iv
procainamide.  She was transferred to the ICU for management of
the procainamide drip.  By hospital day 5, the patient was still
in afib but better rate controlled, cardiology felt procainamide
should be discontinued since patient was out of the window in
which this might be beneficial.  Procainamide was stopped and
diltiazem was continued for rate control.  She was transferred
to the floor.  She has some inattention and perseveration on
exam in addition to a right gaze preference.  Patient has
continued weakness on the right side, and some difficulty
ambulating.  She has actively participated in physical and
occupational therapy here, and they feel she would benefit
greatly from placement in an acute rehabilitation facility.  She
should be monitored on telemetry while in rehab for one week to
ensure adequate rate control.  She is discharged to above in
stable condition.
