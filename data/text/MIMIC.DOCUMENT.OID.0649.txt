Attending:Chaisty Lenway
Chief Complaint:
PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
History was obtained from his son and Danian Ficken records:
Mr. Ficken is a 38 year old male with a PMH significant for
severe MR, ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular
dysfunction with an EF of 30% in 2011-09-23 00:00:00, NSVT, and a history
of ischemic bowel due to overdiuresis.  He was in his usual
state of health until a few days ago when he started feeling
very weak and fatigued.
.
His son went to pick him up tonight, and as they were walking
toward the car, he became fatigued and weak, to the point where
he wanted to go back in the house.  They turned around and as
they were walking toward the house, he progressively became
weaker to the point where his son had to carry him and lay him
on a bench.  They called EMS, and between the time that they
called EMS and their arrival (~5 minutes or longer) he became
pulseless and apneic.
.
On arrival, EMS found him to be apneic and pulsless.  They began
CPR and gave 1mg of epinephrine.  He went into ventricular
tachycardia, and he was shocked once at 200J, and given 1mg of
lidocaine and put on a lidocaine drip.  He was intubated and
bagged in the field.  CPR was performed for 15 minutes.
.
In the ED his VS were BP: 150/70, HR: 60, RR: being bagged.  He
was placed on the lidocaine drip.  His ET tube placement was
verified on chest x-ray.  A left IJ CVL was placed. He was
persistently hypotensive for 40 mins to 80's, ranging 80's to
100's so he was started on Dopamine and arctic sun protocol.
Neuro exam prior to sedation (fentanyl/versed) was positive for
gag, blink, pupils 1mm non-reactive, biting tube, not moving
extremities, not withdrawing from pain.  A-line attempt in L
wrist failed.  CXR clear. Noted to have melana.  After
discussion with the family, arctic sun protocol was stopped.
.
Per the son, he denied any recent complaints of chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, or lightheadedness.  The only significant positive
symptoms were weakness and fatigue x2 days.
.
On arrival to the floor, vitals were BP 102/53, HR 72, RR 17,
and O2 sats of 100% on AC 450/14/5/100% FiO2.  He was intubated
and sedated.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe mitral regurgitation with severely depressed LV and RV
function.
2. Chronic atrial fibrillation, currently off warfarin due to GI
bleeding.
3. Initial VVI pacemaker placed in 2011-09-23 00:00:00 due to symptomatic
bradycardia.
4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, status

5. Nonsustained VT.
6. Prior syncopal episodes in the past due to hypovolemia.
7. Ischemic bowel disease in the setting of over diuresis.
8. Coronary artery disease status post CABG x3 in 2011-09-23 00:00:00 with a
LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the circumflex and acute marginal.

Chest X-Ray 2011-09-23 00:00:00:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: A dual-lead pacing device is
unchanged. There
has been a prior median sternotomy and CABG. An endotracheal
tube tip lies 4 cm from the carina. An NG tube tip is in
stomach. There is a left internal jugular line, with tip
obscured by the overlying pacer leads, though likely lies within
the mid SVC. The heart is top normal in size. Mildly increased
interstitial markings suggest mild fluid overload. There is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip 4 cm from carina, in appropriate
position.
2. Mild vascular congestion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist
.
Chest X-Ray 2011-09-23 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the 123 Any St.us study from 2011-09-23 00:00:00.

The endotracheal tube has been removed. There is a left IJ
central venous
catheter and a Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with intact leads
tips. There has been interval development of the left
retrocardiac opacity and a
left-sided pleural effusion. The opacity may be due to
combination of
atelectasis or developing infiltrate. [**Year (4 digits) **] to resolution is
recommended.  There are no signs of overt pulmonary edema. There
is unchanged persistent cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Ficken is a 38 year old male with a PMH significant for
severe MR, ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular
dysfunction with an EF of 30% in 2011-09-23 00:00:00 s/p CABG, NSVT, and a
history of ischemic bowel due to overdiuresis that presents
after a PEA arrest, inutbated, with a dropping hematocrit.
.
# Respiratory Failure: on 2011-09-23 00:00:00, we were called to the
patients bedside as he was unresponsive.  He was breathing and
had a pulse.  He was transitioned to his bed from the chair.  He
was given fluids wide open in the setting of SBPs in the 60s.
His code status had been discussed with him on 2011-09-23 00:00:00, and he
declared his wish to be DNI. He became apneic, was unresponsive,
and a pulse was lost at 1500 on 2011-09-23 00:00:00 and the patient expired.
.
# PEA arrest: He became apneic and pulsless in the field he was
given 1mg epi, leading to VT.  He was shocked once at 200J and
given 1mg of lidocaine and then placed on a drip.  He was
intubated and hemodynamically stable on admission. He was
successfully extubated the day after admission.  His blood
pressure was stable in the 80s-90s during his stay until he
expired.
.
# GI bleed: Pt had guiac postivie melanotic stools in the ED.
He has a history of ischemic bowel in the setting of
overdiuresis.  His baseline hematocrit is 31.  On admission it
had fallen to 26->24->21.  He recieved 4units of blood with a
transfusion goal of greater than 30.  On 2011-09-23 00:00:00 his hematocrit was
32.
.
# Heart failure: Pt had end stage heart failure s/p CABG, with
severe MR complicated by a GI bleed and transient hypotension,
s/p PEA arrest. He required his home torsemide dose between
units of blood due to his fragile fluid balance. He responded
however, he appeared fluid overloaded on the morning of 2011-09-23 00:00:00.
He had rhonchorus breath sounds and a weak cough. He was given
40mg of IV lasix to help diurese in the setting of recieving 4
units of blood and a worsening chest x-ray concerning for
pleural effusion.
.
# Mental Status: Patient was unresponsive upon hitting the floor
s/p PEA arrest.  Intubated and sedated.  Not following commands.
 He improved greatly after his extubation and appeared to be
close to his baseline.
.
# DMII: On oral hypoglycemics at home.  We held oral medications
in house, but gave ISS to cover hypergylcemia.
.
# BPH: on finasteride and tamsulosin for BPH treatment, we held
his medications in the acute setting.
