History of Present Illness:
Ms. Pratts is a 40 yo woman with metastatic breast CA to bone
direct admitted to the floor for metastasis of the sphenoid
encoroaching on the posterior wall of the L orbit & mandibular
mets causing orbital pain, periorbital and mental numbness. She
has noted these symptoms since about 2013-12-23 00:00:00 and they have
progressed from tingling to numbness. She is also seeing black
spots on her vision. She also notes for the past 2 weeks she has
had weakness &numbness of her LLE, for the past 1 week she has
been unable to flex her hip, extend her knee, or dorsiflex her
foot. She also complains of low back pain. This morning she had
difficulty holding her urine to make it to the bath room. Denies
any peri-anal numbness.
.
She presented to the ED on 2013-12-23 00:00:00 with a few days of numbness in L
side of face, down her body, etc. CT scan was non-diagnostic and
she left AMA. Open MRI (see below) showed bony disease of the
greater wings of sphenoid, extending into the optic canal, and
bony involvement of the mandible approaching the inferior
alveolar nerve canal.

EXAM: MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left lower extremity weakness
and urinaryincontinence, rule out cord compression.

CERVICAL SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and
gradient-echo axial
images of cervical spine were acquired.

FINDINGS: Diffuse metastatic lesions are identified in the
cervical vertebral
bodies on the partially visualized upper thoracic region. Mild
compression of
the inferior endplate of C7 vertebra and mild anterior wedging
of T4 vertebra
are identified. There is no cord compression seen or epidural
mass. The
post-gadolinium cervical images are somewhat limited by motion.
There is no
abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord. Endotracheal tube
is visualized
with retained secretions in the nasopharynx.

IMPRESSION: Diffuse bony metastatic disease. No cord compression
seen.

THORACIC SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images were
obtained before gadolinium. T1 sagittal and axial images were
obtained
following the administration of gadolinium.

FINDINGS: Diffuse bony metastatic lesions are identified in the
thoracic
region. No evidence of epidural mass or spinal cord compression
seen. Mild
wedging of the T4, T6, T10, and T12 vertebral bodies noted.
There is no
evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities
identified. No acute
compression fracture seen. Diffuse metastatic lesions are
identified in the
liver and also an area of atelectasis seen in the left lower
lung.

IMPRESSION: Diffuse bony metastasis. No abnormal intraspinal
enhancement. No
cord compression.

LUMBAR SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images were
obtained before gadolinium. T1 sagittal and axial images were
obtained
following the administration of gadolinium.

FINDINGS: Diffuse bony metastasis is identified in the lumbar
region and in
the visualized sacrum. There is no evidence of high-grade thecal
sac
compression identified. No epidural mass is seen.

At L4-5, there is diffuse disc bulge identified indenting the
thecal sac with
mild left-sided and moderate right-sided foraminal narrowing.
The disc
bulging and a small protrusion is in contact with exiting right
Eldar Pratts nerve root
at this level.

At L5-S1 level, mild disc bulging identified.

IMPRESSION: Diffuse bony metastatic disease. No evidence of
epidural mass or
high-grade thecal sac compression. Degenerative changes in the
lower lumbar
region as described above.

COMMENT: Compared to the 123 Any St.us MRI of 2013-12-23 00:00:00, there appears
to be some
progression of bony metastatic lesions in the spine. No epidural
mass is
seen. The degenerative changes in the lumbar region appear
stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
40F with metastatic breast CA to bone presenting with facial
numbness and leg weakness and urinary incontinence.
.
# Mental Numbness: The patient presented with left sided facial
weakness and bilateral mental numbness. This was thought to be
secondary to metastic disease. The patient was given decadron
10mg IV x 1, and then 4mg po q6hrs. The patient underwent a
single cranial XRT treatment and subsequently her left sided
facial weakness and numbness resolved. Neuro-Onc was consulted
and stated "This is most likely localized in the jaw
but not in the principal or spinal gnaglia of V." The patient
stated her mental numbess was much improved at the time of
discharge.
.
# Left Sided Visual Changes: The patient reported black spots in
her vision upon presentation. This was thought to be second to
optic nerve compression secondary to tumor. Neuro was consulted
and stated "The
tumor to the optical canal explains the eyes symptoms."
Following dexamthasone and XRT the patients symptoms resolved.
.
# Leg Weakness and r/o Cord Comprssion: The patient reported 5
to 7 day history of left lower extremity and numbness prior to
admission. In addition she had noted urinary incontinence. The
initial differential included deficits to cord compression vs a
central process. It thought to be unlikely a central process due
to sparing her arms. The patient was seen by neurology,
neuro-onc and rad-onc. The patient underwent a MRI spine
(requiring subsequent intubation and transfer to the unit for
extubation, details of which are above), that did not reveal
evidence of cord compression. The patient continued to receive
PO dexamethasone and subsequently her leg weakness and numbness
completely at the time of discharge.
.
# Anemia of Chronic Disease: The patient presented with a Hct of
26. Iron studies that were sent that were consistent with anemia
of chronic disease. The patient's Hct at discharge was 24.5. The
patient did not receive transfusions during her hospital course.
The patient should have her hematocrit checked this week.
