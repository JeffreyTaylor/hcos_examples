Chief Complaint:
right superior cerebellar artery stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
68 RHM with PMH of HTN came to the ED for evaluation of acute
onset vertigo and nausea. Code stroke was called.

He was walking to the car this pm to go for golf. He was in the
parking lot and felt sudden onset dizziness. The sensation was
violent and felt as if the entire "world" was spinning around
him. He felt extremely nauseated and sat down. He called his
daughter who felt that his speech was slurred and slow. 911 was
called and he was brought to the ED.

In the ED, as he was being examined, he had one bout of frank
red
hematemesis, with clots. He doesnt have h/o GI bleeds or chronic
alcohol abuse or CLD in the past.

He denied any similar episodes in the past. He , on review,
admitted of having difficulty visualising the left side of any
object he was looking at. He denied double vision. He denied any
weakness on one side or other but felt that his right arm was
"out of control." Denied any acute bladder/ bowel issues.

Stroke scale was 4 ( left facial droop, limb ataxia, visual
field
cut)

Imaging:
2010-03-27 00:00:00   ECHO:
No ASD or PFO identified with the injection of intravenous
saline contrast at rest or with manuevers. No intracardiac
vegetations. Left atrial and right atrial spontaneous echo
contrast but no left atrial appendage, left atrial, right atrial
appendage, or right atrial thrombus identified. No evidence of
simple or complex aortic atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation.
.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   CHEST (PA & LAT):
1. Right basilar heterogeneous opacities are likely linear
atelectasis.
2. Prominent right and left main pulmonary arteries.
3. Mild cardiomegaly.
.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
1. Acute infarction in the right occipital lobe and right
cerebellum.
2. Scattered round foci of susceptibility artifacts in the right
cerebral
sulci, possibly representing deoxygenated blood due to oxygen
extraction from ischemia and less likely for microhemorrhages.

.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   CHEST (PA & LAT): Limited exam with subtle opacities
in the lower lungs which may represent atelectasis versus early
pneumonia. Right AC joint disease. Given technical limitations,
consider a repeat study with more optimized technique to more
thoroughly assess.
.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECON:
1. Right cerebellar hemisphere and right occipital lobe infarct,
with
increased MTT in these regions and likely right superior
cerebellar artery
occlusion on CTA. No corresponding cerebral volume abnormalities
are seen,
compatible with reversible ischemia.
2. No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
3. Mild bilateral soft and calcific atherosclerotic plaques,
slightly worse on the right.
4. Mild ostial narrowing at the left vertebral artery takeoff.

.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   CT BRAIN PERFUSION:
1. Right cerebellar hemisphere and right occipital lobe infarct,
with
increased MTT in these regions and likely right superior
cerebellar artery
occlusion on CTA. No corresponding cerebral volume abnormalities
are seen,
compatible with reversible ischemia.
2. No evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.
3. Mild bilateral soft and calcific atherosclerotic plaques,

4. Mild ostial narrowing at the left vertebral artery takeoff.

.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   ECG: Sinus bradycardia with atrial premature beat.
Left atrial abnormality. Delayed R wave progression is
non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible septal myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Cannot exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the 123 Any St.us tracing of same date there is no
significant change.
.
2010-03-27 00:00:00   ECG: Sinus bradycardia with atrial premature beat.
Intra-atrial conduction delay. Delayed R wave progression is
non-diagnostic but cannot exclude possible prior septal
myocardial infarction. Diffuse T wave abnormalities. Cannot
exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
No 123 Any St.us tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:

68 RHM with HTN presented with acute onset vertigo. CTA does
show possible occlusion of right SCA. Event appears mostly
embolic and warrants embolic work up. GIB at time of
presentation, tPA deferred at that time due to risk of life
threatening GIB/ICH. Initially admitted to neuro ICU,
transferred to neuromed floor on 2010-03-27 00:00:00.
.
Neurologic: Neurologic examination showed left visual field cut,
left facial droop and right UE ataxia; exam remained stable
throughout admission. CTA revealed proximal and distal right
cervical internal carotid artery 4 mm in diameter. The proximal
and distal left cervical internal carotid artery measure 4 and 5
mm, respectively. BP goal was 110-170/90, achieved with home
meds; lisinopril briefly held during admission due to renal
insufficiency. Increased home nifedipine to 180mg daily and
started HCTZ 25mg daily for improved BP control. Stroke risk
factors checked, LDL 118, HBA1C 5.9. Pt on statin at home,
increased dose for goal LDL < 75. Pt initially placed on heparin
gtt and transitioned to Lovenox/coumadin as TEE revealed eft
atrial and right atrial spontaneous echo contrast. OT/PT
consulted during admission, recommended acute rehab.
.
Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: New onset hematemesis at time of
presentation. UGIE with some small, non-bleeding gastric
erosions, no evidence of acute source of bleeding. Pt's
hematocrit remained stable without further episodes of
hematemesis during admission. LFTs within normal limits. Pt was
placed on PPI gtt while on heparin gtt, transitioned to H2B
indefinitely per GI consult to prevent further gastric erosions.
.
Cardiovascular: Initial EKG in ED revealed pre-mature atrial
contractions. Repeat EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, no episodes
of arrhythmia noted throughout admission. CE negative x 1. Goal
SBP < 160 achieved with adjustment of home antihypertensives
(nifedipine CR 180mg qd, atenolol 50 qd); lisinopril 40 qd held
briefly due to elevated Cr.  Started HCTZ for additional BP
control. LDL 118, increased home simvastatin from 10 to 40mg
daily. TEE revealed no ASD or PFO identified with the injection
of intravenous saline contrast at rest or with manuevers. No
intracardiac vegetations. Left atrial and right atrial
spontaneous echo contrast but no left atrial appendage, left
atrial, right atrial appendage, or right atrial thrombus
identified. No evidence of simple or complex aortic atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. Mild aortic regurgitation.
.
Renal: Low UOP during admission with elevated creatinine, FENA
0.3%. Pt given NS boluses, lisinopril held briefly. Pt will need
close monitoring of renal function as he has had elevated
creatinine; urine lytes during admission revealed pre-renal
azotemia (FeNa 0.3%). Have started pt back on home ACEi and also
started HCTZ for optimal blood pressure control. Please check
daily lytes and encourage PO intake/fluid bolus prn.
.
Infectious disease: febrile to 102.2 on HD 1; UA/UCx negative,
BCx negative at time of discharge. CXR with questionable
aspiration pneumonia vs atelectasis. Stated patient on Augmentin
and flagyl on 2010-03-27 00:00:00 for 10 day course due to clinical hx of
emesis, delirium, elevated WBC. WBC wnl at time of discharge.
.
Pulmonary: Possible aspiratrion PNA as above. Abx therapy as
above.
.
Nutrition: Cardiac diet
.
Hematology: Hct stable throughout admission. Anticoagulation as
above. No further episodes of hemetemasis after admission to
neuromed floor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Navis,

You were admitted for a right superior cerebellar artery stroke.
 This may have been caused by a blood clot from your heart.  You
were started on Lovenox/Coumadin for stroke protection.  Your
stroke risk factors were checked.  You should not smoke.  Your
LDL cholesterol was 118.  Your statin was increased as your
cholesterol is not at goal.  You had a cardiac echocardiogram
which demonstrated no clear cardioembolic source.  You were
checked for blood glucose control with a HgB A1c.  The level was
5.9.  You need to continue your blood pressure control.

You should continue to eat a low fat healthy diet, and follow up
with your primary care physician and stroke Neurology as noted
below.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-INCREASE simvastatin to 40mg by mouth daily to lower
cholesterol
-INCREASE nifedipine to 180mg by mouth daily to lower your blood
pressure
-START hydrochlorathiazide 12.5mg  by mouth twice daily to lower
your blood pressure
-START Lovenox injections twice a day to prevent blood clot;
stop once INR 2010-03-27 00:00:00
-START Coumadin 5mg by mouth daily to prevent blood clot; dosage
may be changed for goal INR 2010-03-27 00:00:00.
-START famotidine 20mg by mouth twice a day to prevent bleeding
from your stomach
-START Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid and metronidazole by mouth
for a total of 10 days for your lung infection

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your primary care doctor at test@mail.com to make an
appointment within 5-10 days after being discharged from your
rehabilation center.
