Imaging:
-CXR (2012-10-30 00:00:00) - 1. Coarse bilateral interstitial opacities
with more focal opacity in the left lung base. Findings may
represent aspiration or pneumonia with mild pulmonary edema.
Small left pleural effusion.
2. Gaseous distention of the hepatic flexure of the colon and
stomach as
described above; correlate clinically.

-CTA Chest (2012-10-30 00:00:00) - 1. No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Bibasilar opacities, likely reflecting components of early
pneumonia and atelectasis. However, due to several nodular
areas, follow-up chest CT when symptoms resolve is recommended.

-CXR (2012-10-30 00:00:00) - 1. Mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar
opacities worrisome for interstitial infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo M w/ h/o Down's syndrome, non-verbal at baseline,
hypothyroidism, cataracts, dysphagia s/p G-tube, h/o aspiration
pna's, hypoNa on 4Lnc QHS who presents w/ cough and hypoxia from
group home.
.
# Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Was initially
admitted to the MICU given respiratory distress.  Pt had CTA
that was negative for PE though notable for bibasilar opacities
concerning for pneumonia.  He was started on vanc/zosyn for
aspiration pna.  His O2 requirement was weaned w/ treatment from
face mask to nasal cannula at the time of discharge.  On the
floor, his antibiotics were switched to levaquin and he remained
afebrile.
.
# HypoNa: Chronic per facility records.  Improved with IVFs
after admission to ICU.  Na stable at 134-135 at time of
discharge.
.
# Hypotension: Baseline BP 90s per records.  Patient maintained
SBP 80s-low 100s, w/ intermittent readings of 70s and he
received intermittent fluid bolus while in the ICU.  Cortisol
was normal.  TSH elevated, though free t4 was normal.  His urine
output remained good and his hypotension was felt to be at
baseline and tolerated.  Of note urine cx were neg; blood cx
grew coag(-) staph from 1 bottle which was felt to be
contaminant, subsequent blood cultures showed no growth and he
remained afebrile without other signs of bacteremia.
.
# Down's syndrome, non-verbal at baseline: Appears to be at his
recent baseline per family and group home records.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid
.
#G-tube - In the ICU there was concern about position of tube,
surgery was consulted and felt that tube was properly placed.
Wound culture grew Dechelle Klemp and he was started on nystatin cream
to the site.
.
#Code status this admission - Full code.  Had family meeting
with brother, Dechelle Klemp, regarding code status and goals of care.
We explained that it is possible that these recurrent aspiration
events may continue to occur, and his brother stated that he
still wished for full resuscitation, including intubation if
necessary.  Lashada Munder stated that the family wanted another
neurological evaluation before they made any changes to his code
status.  The geriatrics team was involved with this meeting and
are working on having him reevaluated again.
.
#Transitional issues
-Will need ongoing assessment of neurological function, has
follow-up arranged
-Will need ongoing assessment of goals of care, started this
discussion with his brother, Dechelle Klemp, during this admission
