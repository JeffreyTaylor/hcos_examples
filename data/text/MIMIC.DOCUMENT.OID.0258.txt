with no bruits, 2 plus bilaterally on femorals, 2 plus
bilaterally on radials, and 2 plus bilaterally on both DP and
PT peripheral pulses.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient did have severe two-vessel disease
with an anomalous left main.  He was referred to Dr. 123 Any St.es) 2507**] for cardiac surgery with the plan as patient to go
home as asymptomatic and stable and return for surgery.

HOHazel COURSE:  The patient was readmitted on 2006-02-15 00:00:00 to Dr. Hazel [**Last Name (123 Any St.es) 2508**] service, and he underwent a
coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with LIMA to the LAD,
vein graft to the posterolateral, and a vein graft to the OM.
In addition, an endarterectomy of the proximal LAD was
performed with a vein patch angioplasty proximal to the LIMA-
LAD anastomosis.  The patient was transferred to
Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine drip
and a propofol drip.

On postoperative day 1, the patient was doing well
postoperatively and was extubated at 2230 in the evening with
good ABGs, and continued to be monitored closely, but was
proceeding well.  The Neo-Synephrine was weaned on
postoperative day 2.  The patient had no events overnight.
He had a T-max of 100.3.  He was sinus tachycardia at 108
with a blood pressure of 118/52, and was satting 96 percent
on 1 liter nasal cannula.  He remained on Neo-Synephrine drip
at 1 mcg/kg/min.  The patient started aspirin and Plavix
both.  He remained in the Cardiothoracic ICU.  Postoperative
labs as follows:  K 3.9, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8.  Hematocrit
dropped slightly from 26.5 to 21.5.  The patient was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Chest x-ray
was repeated, and Lasix diuresis was begun.  The patient
remained in the ICU to manage his dependence on Neo-
Synephrine and his dropping hematocrit.

On postoperative day 3, his chest tubes had been pulled.  He
did receive the 2 units of packed red blood cells on the day
prior.  He was restarted on his beta blocker, metoprolol 12.5
UPMCE, in addition to the aspirin and Plavix.  He was in sinus
rhythm at 90, with a blood pressure of 153/66, with a
reasonable blood gas and was satting 94 percent on 1 liter
nasal cannula.  Hematocrit remained increased to 25.5 post-
transfusion, with a BUN of 17, creatinine 0.6.  Lasix was
increased to 20 UPMCE.  Pacing wires were discontinued.  The
patient was transferred out to the floor where he began his
ambulation with physical therapy and the nursing staff, and
to continue working with them.

He did have an episode of increased heart rate to 110.
Lopressor was given on the 22 at 1800 in the evening.  This
dropped his heart rate down into the 80's again.  He did have
a complaint of some tooth pain on the right side and had a
little bit of serosanguineous drainage from the distal
portion of his sternal incision.  He continued ambulating
tid.  Discharge teaching and planning was begun.  The serous
drainage from his chest was managed, and he continued with
pulmonary toilet and ambulation.

On postoperative day 4, the patient still was complaining of
some tooth pain.  He continued his ambulation on the floor.
He had a heart rate of 88 with a blood pressure of 90/56, and
remained in stable condition.  BUN 17, creatinine 0.6 from
the day prior.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His
abdominal exam was benign.  His wounds were clean, dry and
intact.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The plan was
to try and DC him home if possible after evaluation by
physical therapy.  The patient had some issue with
constipation for which Milk of Magnesia was prescribed.

Labs on the 23 were as follows:  White count 7.5, hematocrit
28.4, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, blood sugar 123.  Magnesium was
supplemented when the lab value returned at 1.8 and was
repleted.  K was 3.7, sodium 140.  His heart rate increased
slightly during the day from sinus rhythm to sinus tach with
his known bundle branch block.  He was seen by case
management on the 23.  PT evaluated the patient and
anticipated that he would be able to go home as soon as he
was medically stable.  The plan was to follow-up with Care
Group Home Care and possibly Hazel for better sugar
management.

On postoperative day 5, the patient was stable
hemodynamically with a blood pressure of 140/67, in sinus
rhythm in the 80's, satting 96 percent on room air.  He did
