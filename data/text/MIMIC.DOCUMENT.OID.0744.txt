Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 92 M with end-stage ge junction lymphoma encasing trachea,
cad s/p cabg, htn who presented with septic shock.
.
1. Cardiogenic / septic shock:
The pt was admitted from the ED per sepsis protocol, with an
elevated lactate and bp in the 80's systolic. He was
aggressively fluid resuscitated and started on Levophed. An
arterial bp line was placed in the ICU for better bp monitoring.
He was off pressors on the following day with stable bp. In
terms of the hydrocort/fludrocort, he was discharged with this
after his recent 123 Any St.us admission for sepsis. These were
initially started on 2013-03-10 00:00:00. They were continued for possible
adrenal insufficiency in the setting of possible sepsis this
admission. He can d/c the fludrocort and hydrocort and start a
prednisone taper over 6 days.
.
2. Line Sepsis:
Cx data from UPMCE Rehab showed MRSA in bld Cx, MRSA and
Psuedomonas in sputum cx. Fever in ED, no WBC count, clear CXR.
Came in with 2 PICC lines from rehab and a fem CVC from the ED
which were all pulled. Pseudomonas is likely trach colonizer and
no signs of PNA, although given the possible septic shock he was
treated with zosyn in addition to the vancomycin intially. The
zosyn was stopped prior to discharge since there was no sign of
PNA.
.
3. Lymphoma of GE junction:
Dr. Alijha Albiani,oncologist. Has been getting palliative chemo but is
no longer candidate for further radiation.Per oncologist and
MICU team, multiple conversations (last admission) had with
family informing them of pt's extremely poor prognosis. Per
Oncologist, pt has days to weeks left given poor prognosis,
metastatic lymphoma now encasing carotids/major vessels in neck
as well as affecting/deviating trachea. Family UPMCE
hospice/palliative care, however family refused palliative care
services on multiple occasion on last admission- will readdress
this admission with family.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation:
Rate remained well controlled off dilt. Dilt was added back at a
lower dosage than he came in on since the bp is in the 110's
systolic. Anti-coagulation as per below.
.
5. h/o PE:
Continued anticoaguation with coumadin.
5. hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine.
6. FEN- restarted tube feeds after hemodynamically stable.
