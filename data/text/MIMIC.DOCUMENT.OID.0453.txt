Service:ORTHO
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year-old woman
with a history of hypertension, status post cerebrovascular
accident with residual left sided weakness, status post right
CEA in 2005-09-26 00:00:00 who is admitted for an L4-S1 decompression/fusion
on 2005-09-26 00:00:00.  The patient's postoperative course was
electrocardiogram with new T wave inversions laterally, but
otherwise not significantly changed.  The patient ruled out
by enzymes after this incident and was transferred to the
floor.  The patient also received intraoperative Labetalol
for hypertension.  Telemetry overnight after her episode of
chest pain demonstrated premature ventricular contractions
and bigeminy.  The patient was seen by cardiology consult
pressure control.  On 2005-09-26 00:00:00, the patient began to
develop paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response and was subsequently anticoagulated on
heparin and Coumadin and placed on Amiodarone.  However, on
2005-09-26 00:00:00 the patient's hematocrit dropped from 36 to 24
with a decrease in blood pressure and was found to have a
rectus sheath hematoma.  The patient received 6 units of
packed red blood cells, 5 units of fresh frozen platelets and
her anticoagulation reversed.  The patient was transferred to
the SICU where arterial line was placed and the patient was
placed on Nipride.

On 2005-09-26 00:00:00 the patient was stable and transferred to the
floor with a resorbing hematoma and a normal sinus rhythm.
She at that point was denying chest pain, shortness of
breath, lightheadedness, although she was having some
abdominal tenderness.  She was noted to have been having some
trouble with po and is being followed by the speech and
swallow team and was also noted to have some confusion and
mental status changes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Small vessel
cerebrovascular accident in 2005-09-26 00:00:00 with residual left
sided weakness.  3.  Bilateral carotid stenosis status post
right CEA in 2005-09-26 00:00:00 and with left CVBD.  In 2005-09-26 00:00:00 the
patient was noted to have mild right ICA plaque and 60 to 69%
[**Doctor First Name 3050**].  4.  Status post spinal fusion 2005-09-26 00:00:00.  5.
Status post echocardiogram in 2005-09-26 00:00:00 demonstrating normal left
ventricular function and trace AI.  Status post ETT in 2005-09-26 00:00:00
with equivocal results.  6.  Status post parotid gland
excision at UPMCE for a tumor.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day.  2.
Detrol 1 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Cozaar 25 mg po t.i.d.  4.  MVI 1
po q.d.  5.  Zoloft 25 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is "sensitive" to Percocets.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in an apartment in a
senior housing center with three children who visit her
regularly.  The patient has always used a walker and receives
food from Meals on Wheels.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR FROM THE SICU
ON 2005-09-26 00:00:00:  Vital signs blood pressure 155/72.  Pulse 84.
97% on 2 liters.  Respiratory rate 23.  In general, this is
an elderly female in no acute distress lying comfortably in
bed.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck is with some positive
JVD.  Heart regular rate and rhythm.  Plus S1 S2.  3 out of 6
systolic murmur.  Lungs with bilateral rales and decreased
breath sounds at bases.  Abdomen with decreased bowel sounds,
soft, tender to palpation diffusely with no rebound.
Extremities 1+ edema.  Neurological alert and oriented times
two.  She knows full name, UPMCE, 2005-09-26 00:00:00, but believes the month is 2005-09-26 00:00:00.  She moves all
four extremities.

SIGNIFICANT LABORATORIES UPON TRANSFER TO FLOOR:  White blood
cell count 17.8, hematocrit 30.8, urinalysis with positive
nitrites, 18 red blood cells, 23 white blood cells and urine
culture with 100,000 E-coli.  Echocardiogram from 2005-09-26 00:00:00
with a hyperdynamic EF of 75%, trace AI, 1 to 2+ MR.  Chest
x-ray from 2005-09-26 00:00:00 with cardiomegaly, increased
interstitial markings and diffuse haziness of pulmonary
vessels consistent with a worsening congestive heart failure
and small bilateral pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  General, this is an 82 year-old woman
status post laminectomy with a history of hypertension,
bilateral carotid stenoses and now this hospitalization is
complicated by chest pain in the PACU and the patient was
subsequently ruled out by myocardial infarctions, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, which was treated with anticoagulation
and the patient subsequently developed a rectus sheath
hematoma.  The patient transferred to the UPMCE status post
rectus sheath hematoma for her hypotension and decreased
hematocrit, but four days later was doing quite well and was
transferred to medicine for management of her atrial
fibrillation and mental status changes and social issues on
2005-09-26 00:00:00.

1.  Cardiovascular:  A:  Rate and rhythm.  The patient with
new onset paroxysmal atrial fibrillation first noted on
2005-09-26 00:00:00 or 19.  It was initially treated with
anticoagulation, but secondary to rectus sheath hematoma
anticoagulation was discontinued.  Telemetry was continued
throughout the course of her hospitalization and the patient
had episodic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The patient was
loaded on 400 mg of Amiodarone b.i.d. after receiving a
several day course of intravenous Amiodarone.  Lopressor was
increased to 75 mg t.i.d.

B:  Coronary artery disease/ischemia.  The patient with
episode of chest pain in PACU with lateral electrocardiogram
changes, but was subsequently ruled out by enzymes.
Echocardiogram as an inpatient revealed a hyperdynamic EF,
but no other significant changes other then some 1 to 2+
mitral regurgitation, which was new.  No further workup was
done at this time and the patient remained pain free
throughout the course of her hospitalization.  The patient
will be medically managed with Lopressor, aspirin, Cozaar.

C:  Hypertension.  Patient with elevated blood pressure
throughout the course of her hospitalization receiving
Labetalol intraoperatively.  The patient was noted to be
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures under 100 when she
was in atrial fibrillation, but after transfer to the floor
this was not noted at any time.  Cozaar was increased to 50
mg b.i.d., Lopressor was increased to 75 mg t.i.d. and
Hydrochlorothiazide was begun as the patient was still having
systolic blood pressures in the 150s and 160s.

D: cardiac:  The patient was noted upon transfer to the floor
on 2005-09-26 00:00:00 to have congestive heart failure on chest x-ray
and on examination and was gently diuresed with prn Lasix 20
mg intravenous with good resolution of her congestive heart
failure.  The patient continued to have some slight crackles
on examination and trace leg edema, but was having good
oxygen saturation on room air.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was noted throughout her
hospital course to be having trouble tolerating po with
coughing and a question of aspiration.  She was followed by
speech and swallow throughout the course of her
hospitalization and required all of her pills to be crushed.
Swallowing study on 2005-09-26 00:00:00 demonstrated a poor bolus
formation with flow transit in oral phase and premature
spillage, but without evidence of aspiration or spillage.
The patient will continue on a soft solid diet with thin
liquids.  The patient should take small bites and drink small
sips alternatively and should sit up in 90 degree position
when taking po.  The patient seemed to tolerate this well
during this admission.  Prevacid liquid 30 cc q day and
Colace were continued.

3.  Infectious disease:  Patient with urine cultures positive
for 100,000 E-Coli.  She was continued on a five day course
of Levofloxacin.  However, by 2005-09-26 00:00:00 the patient was
still having low grade fevers to 99.5 and monitoring was
continued.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient with elevated blood glucoses
noted in the Intensive Care Unit, however, upon transfer to
the floor her finger stick blood sugars were taken four times
a day and were noted to be all within normal limits.  Q.i.d.
D6 were discontinued.

5.  Pulmonary:  The patient maintained good oxygen
saturations upon transfer from the Intensive Care Unit on 2
liters of oxygen, however, after gentle diuresis the patient
was able to maintain saturations of 93% on room air.

6.  Neurology:  The patient was noted to be somewhat confused
and disoriented to place and time while in the Intensive Care
Unit, but upon transfer to the floor her mental status
cleared and the patient became alert and oriented times
three.  The patient was still noted to have some residual
left sided weakness.

7.  Hematology:  The patient was noted to have a stable
hematocrit of 30 to 33 upon transfer to the floor from the
Intensive Care Unit status post her rectus sheath hematoma.
It is felt that her hematoma is likely resorbing at this
time.  Will continue to monitor her hematocrit and guaiac all
stools.

8.  Back:  The patient is status post laminectomy and spinal
cord fusion.  Her back wound is noted to be clean, dry and
intact throughout this admission and staples were removed on
2005-09-26 00:00:00 with no complications.

9.  Disposition:  The patient will be discharge to
rehabilitation where she will receive physical therapy,
occupational therapy and continued monitoring from speech and
swallow team.  She should follow up with cardiology in three
to four weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  1.  Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d.  2.
Cozaar 50 mg po b.i.d.  3.  Aspirin 81 mg chewable four tabs
q day.  4.  Zoloft 25 q.d.  5.  MVI one q.d.  6.  Detrol 1 mg
po b.i.d.  7.  Lopressor 75 t.i.d.  8.  Prevacid liquid 30 mg
po q.d.  9.  Colace 100 po b.i.d.  10.  Hydrochlorothiazide
25 mg po q day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Status post L4 to S1 decompression/fusion on 2005-09-26 00:00:00.
3.  Status post rectus sheath hematoma.
4.  Urinary tract infection with E-coli.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
