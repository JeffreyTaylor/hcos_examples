History of Present Illness:
This is a 86 y/o male with a h/o CAD, CHF (EF 30-40%), HTN, MDS,
recent admission in 2007-07-18 00:00:00 for diarrhea and treated
presumptively for c diff given his past history of c diff
enterocolitis, who now presents to the ED with
n/v/weakness/dehydration/diarrhea/epigastric abd pain x 24
hours. Pt also had one episode of emesis (no blood) yesterday.
He is still on his course of flagyl from recent admission, but
has missed the last few doses due to outpt pharmacy issues.
.
In the Hirsh Smethers, pt was noted to have an elevated lipase and amylase
of 557 and 900, respectively. He was also noted to have an
elevated lactate of 3.2 and a positive u/a with 6-10 wbc's,
trace leuks, neg nitrates. He was initially to be admitted to
medicine, however pt dropped his SBP from 110 to 90,
asymptomatic. Received 500 cc with good response and current SBP
in the 100's. Received a total of 1 L NS. He was given
Vanc/CTX/flagyl in the ED for h/o MRSA, positive u/a, and recent
h/o c diff enterocolitis (2007-07-18 00:00:00).
.
Currently, through aid of daughter translating, pt denies any
f/c/s, dizziness/lightheadedness, chest pain, SOB, palpitations,
n/v, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms. +generalized weakness,
but not much different from baseline. +diarrhea, no
BRBPR/hematochezia/melena.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST 2007-07-18 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffusely swollen pancreas consistent with mild pancreatitis
without peripancreatic fluid collections noted.
2.  Mildly atrophic kidneys with diffuse calcification of the
renal artery ostia are noted.  MRA of the renal artery is
recommended bilaterally if clinical suspicious for stenosis.
3.  Diffuse rectal, sigmoid, and descending colon wall
thickening suggestive of colitis.
4.  Enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes noted on 123 Any St.us exam,
unchanged and of unknown significance.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 2007-07-18 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 2007-07-18 00:00:00:
Lungs are clear.  Heart size normal.  No pleural abnormality or
evidence of central adenopathy.  Right hemidiaphragm is
persistently elevated given part to interposition of the hepatic
flexure of the colon between diaphragm and liver.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  2007-07-18 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:
1. Again seen is stranding around the pancreas, consistent with
pancreatitis. There appears to be some interval increase in the
degree of stranding within the small bowel mesentery, and along
the pericolic gutters. There is a small amount of fluid along
the pericolic gutters and within the pelvis, which is slightly
increased from the prior study. No focal abscesses are
identified.
2. There are bilateral pleural effusions which also have
increased slightly in comparison to the prior study. The
remainder of the exam is unchanged.
.
Blood draws were discontinued when the decision was made for
CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86 yoM with PMH CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, MDS, recent
admission for presumed C. difficile colitis, admitted to the
MICU with diarrhea and hypotension admitted to floor 2007-07-18 00:00:00. After
family meetings to address goals of care in this patient with
chronic pain and MDS most likely with leukemic transformation,
not likely a candidate for therapy per hematology, the patient
was made DNR/DNI/CMO.
.
1. Diarrhea. The diarrhea continued to improve with decreased
stool number and volume on the floor. CT abdomen 2007-07-18 00:00:00 showed
diffuse rectal, sigmoid, and descending colon wall thickening
suggestive of colitis. With the patient's elevated WBC, there
was concern for an infectious source. His stool cultures were
negative x2 and C. difficile toxin was negative x3, however, the
patient had a history of recent antibiotic use. The original
plan with the GI consult team was to perform a colonoscopy once
the patient was stable to elucidate the cause of the diarrhea;
this was no longer necessary as the patient is CMO. The
patient's initial antibiotic treatment included levofloxacin and
flagyl on admission. The patient continued to spike fevers
despite antibiotic treatment. Levofloxacin was discontinued and
ceftriaxone was started to broaden coverage 2007-07-18 00:00:00. Infectious
disease was consulted to comment on antibiotic coverage. Flagyl
was discontinued 2007-07-18 00:00:00, with vancomycin IV started 2007-07-18 00:00:00. Vancomycin
by mouth and imipenum was started 2007-07-18 00:00:00. The patient was continued
on vancomycin IV and by mouth and imipenum until the decision
was made for the patient to be CMO 2007-07-18 00:00:00. The patient was kept
hydrated intravenously and with free water boluses through his
feeding tube to replace his GI losses.
.
2. Fever/leukocytosis. The patient was started on levofloxacin
and flagyl for presumptive infectious colitis, with antibiotic
changes as above per ID recommendations. Blood cultures taken
2007-07-18 00:00:00, 2007-07-18 00:00:00, 2007-07-18 00:00:00, 2007-07-18 00:00:00, 2007-07-18 00:00:00 were negative. Urine cultures 7/28,
2007-07-18 00:00:00, 2007-07-18 00:00:00 were negative. Multiple chest x-rays were within
normal limits. An echocardiogram did not show evidence of
endocarditis. As above, the patient continued to spike low grade
fevers despite treatment with antibiotics. The patient's white
blood cells at baseline were 19-25 thought secondary to MDS. The
white blood cell count elevated to 80s on this admission.
Hematology felt that the patient's blood smears were concerning
for leukemic transformation of the MDS. Cytology was sent prior
to the decision for CMO and was pending at the time of
discharge.
.
3. MDS. Hematology/oncology followed the patient during
hospitalization. The team confirmed the diagnosis of MDS from
his original smear. This was an atypical presentation as the
patient was diagnosed in 2007-07-18 00:00:00 and an extended lifespan is
inconsistent with the diagnosis of MDS. As above, the team felt
that the patient's blood smears during the end of his
hospitalization were concerning for leukemic transformation. The
patient was not a good candidate for chemotherapy. Cytology was
sent prior to the decision for CMO and was pending at the time
of discharge.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia. The patient had platelets in the 40s in the
past. On this admission, the patient's platelets dropped as low
as 12. The thrombocytopenia was likely secondary to acute
illness and the patient's underlying bone marrow disorder.
DIC/Dylane Slunaker were thought unlikely although there were occasional
schistocytes on smear. The patient was given a platelet
transfusion 2007-07-18 00:00:00 at the time his platelets were 12. His platelets
responded immediately afterwards but continued to drop and his
last measurement was 31.
.
#) Anemia. The patient's hematocrit decreased during his
hospital course. His baseline was low: 28-32. The anemia was
macrocytic with recent normal B12, folate 2007-07-18 00:00:00. His low
reticulocyte count was indicative of a hypoproliferative
disorder, most likely secondary to MDS with likely leukemic
transformation. He was given two transfusions 2007-07-18 00:00:00 and 2007-07-18 00:00:00 when
his hematocrit dropped below 25. His hematocrit would respond
appropriately immediately afterwards but continued to drop
during hospitalization.
.
#) Shortness of breath. The shortness of breath was most likely
secondary to pulmonary edema from the patient's congestive heart
failure and bronchoconstriction. The patient was given lasix 10
mg as needed, ipratropium nebulizers as needed, and oxygen as
needed. The patient was discharged with nebulizers as needed.
.
#) Mental status. The patient was alert and oriented on
admission. The patient's mental staus waxed and waned throughout
admission. His mental status was most likely secondary to
underlying dementia with superimposed infection/hospitalization.
CT head showed prior infarct. CT head 2007-07-18 00:00:00 negative for
increased ICP, hemorrhage.
.
#) Pancreatitis. The patient was found to have a chemical
pancreatitis; he remained asymptomatic without complaints of
epigastric pain. Amylase and lipase continued to trend down
throughout admission. The patient was kept NPO with NJ tube
placement 2007-07-18 00:00:00 for feeding. A RUQ ultrasound was negative for
gallstones. The NJ tube was removed when the decision was made
for CMO.
.
#) Elevated INR. The patient had an increased INR to 1.8 in the
MICU, likely in setting of nutritional deficiency from diarrhea.
He was given vitamin K 5 mg SC x 3 doses in the MICU. His INR
continued to remain elevated throughout hospitalization.
.
#) CAD. The patient had no active symptoms and remained stable.
Initially he was continued on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, and
his ace-inhibitor. Aspirin and plavix were discontinued when the
patient was thrombocytopenic and in anticipation of possible
colonoscopy with biopsies. His antihypertensive treatment was
discontinued when the decision was made for CMO.
.
#) Congestive heart failure. The patienet was initially
hypovolemic secondary to diarrhea. The patient was continued on
maintenance IVF and free water boluses through his NJ tube once
placed. The patient's low albumin was counterproductive to keep
fluids in the intravascular space. The patient became
transiently fluid overloaded and given lasix 10 mg x2 with
effective diuresis. IVF and free water boluses were stopped when
the patient became CMO.
.
#) Pain. The patient at baseline had pain with movement of his
extremities. There was increased pain with movement of the right
upper extremity, films were taken of the wrist, elbow, and
shoulder without evidence of destructive disease or any acute
issues. The patient was treated with tylenol and morphine with
good effect. The patient was continued morphone elixer upon
discharge.
.
#) Hiccups. The patient at times complained of intractable
hiccups. Thorazine was given with good effect. This was
continued through the patient's CMO status.
.
#) F/E/N. The patient's tube feeds were continued through the NG
tube from the MICU, transiently stopped for placement of an NJ
tube per GI recommendations, and restarted. The patient's
albumin continued to drop, although the patient was at goal tube
feeds. Electrolytes were repleted as necessary. The NJ tube was
discontinued when the decision was made for CMO.
.
#) Precautions. The patient was placed on MRSA precautions were
a positive swab 2007-07-18 00:00:00.
