MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  2006-09-07 00:00:00 3:44 PM

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST

Reason: rule out infarct or underlying lesion
Contrast: MAGNEVIST

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old man with hypodensity within the left cerebellum
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
rule out infarct or underlying lesion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

MR HEAD

HISTORY: 65-year-old man with left cerebellar hypodensity,
assess for infarct or underlying lesion.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence MR images of the head were
obtained before and after the administration of IV gadolinium.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior head CT from 2006-09-07 00:00:00 and
2006-09-07 00:00:00 as well as a prior MR of the cervical spine from
2006-09-07 00:00:00.

There is a small area of T2 hyperintensity with slow diffusion
involving the left cerebellum corresponding to the hypodensity
seen on CT scan. This finding likely represents an infarct.

There is also a small area of T2 hyperintensity and slow
diffusion involving the left inferior posterior temporal lobe
just above the temporal bone which likely represents an area of
contusion. Another small area of T2 hyperintensity with some
minimal slow diffusion and enhancement is seen along the left
lateral temporal lobe which also likely represents an area of
contusion.

Small bilateral subdural hematomas are seen over the temporal
poles as well as a small subdural hematoma over the right
frontal lobe. Tiny amount of blood within the occipital horns of
the lateral ventricles are seen which is decreased in size
compared to 2006-09-07 00:00:00.

The 123 Any St.usly seen fluid-fluid level within the cisterna magna
is not seen on this study.

There is a minimal amount of deep and periventricular white
matter T2 hyperintensities which likely represents chronic
microangiopathic changes. The ventricles and extra-axial CSF
spaces are unchanged in size or configuration.

Mucosal thickening of the visualized paranasal sinuses are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Infarct of the left cerebellum corresponding to the
hypodensity seen on CT scan.
2. Few small contusions of the left temporal lobe.
3. Small bilateral subdural hematomas and decreasing amount of
blood within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT ORBIT.

HISTORY: 65-year-old male with trauma complains of hearing loss.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the temporal bones was performed with 1.25 mm
axial and coronal and oblique sagittal reconstructions.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a prior head CT from 2006-09-07 00:00:00 as
well as a concurrent head MR.

The scout images show a new anterior fixation and screws over C2
and C3. There is overlying prevertebral soft tissue swelling,
which likely represents post- surgical change.

Again seen are multiple fractures of the right temporal bone
with approximately 2-mm depression of the bony fragment. One of
the fracture lines extends to the floor of the right middle
cranial fossa but does not appear to extend into any of the
skull base foramina or carotid canal. A nondisplaced fracture of
the right zygomatic arch is again seen.

No fractures extending into the mastoid air cells, middle ear
cavities, inner ear structures are noted. The mastoid air cells
and middle ear cavities are clear. There is no dislocation of
the ossicles. The inner ear structures appear normal.

Calcification of the carotid siphons is seen bilaterally.

There is depression of the right nasal bone.

Minimal mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses and the
ethmoid air cells are seen bilaterally. There is moderate
mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinus. Incidental note is
made of Onodi cells bilaterally with pneumatization of the optic
struts.

Several periapical lucencies around maxillary teeth are seen
which may represent periodontal disease versus periapical
inflammatory lesions.

Note is again made of two small hemorrhagic contusions of the
left temporal lobe and a small hypodensity of the left
cerebellum. Small subdural hematomas of the overlying temporal
lobes bilaterally are again seen.

IMPRESSION: Again visualized is a minimally depressed fracture
of the right temporal bone as well as a nondisplaced fracture of
the right zygomatic arch.

Two small left temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusions, infarct of
the left cerebellum, and small bilateral subdural hematomas are
again seen.

The middle ear cavities and inner ear structures are intact.

HISTORY: 65-year-old male one day following spinal surgery with
fever of 103.7.

COMPARISON: None available.

TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Bilateral basilar atelectasis is likely
a postoperative finding. Mild cardiomegaly may be suggestive of
longstanding hypertension. No pneumothorax or effusion is
identified. There is no focus of consolidation to suggest
pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral basilar atelectasis, likely postoperative.

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for ligamentous injury

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
65M s/p closed R temporal fx, pneumocephalus, epidural hematoma
C2-3 w indentation of cord, ?C3 fx
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for ligamentous injury
MR CERVICAL SPINE

HISTORY: 65-year-old male status post closed right temporal
fracture with epidural hematoma at C2/3, question C3 fracture.
Evaluate for ligamentous injury.

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, STIR of the cervical spine extending
from the skull base to the T1/2 level and axial T2 and GRE
images extending from the mid C2 through the C7/T1 levels were
obtained.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to CT of the cervical spine from
2006-09-07 00:00:00 as well as a head CT from that same date.

The alignment of the cervical spine is normal. There is no loss
of vertebral body heights or intervertebral disc space heights.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling or edema. The
visualized bone marrow signal is normal. There is no evidence of
ligamentous disruption or injury.

The visualized brainstem, cervical cord, and upper thoracic cord
are normal in signal intensity and caliber.

Within the cisterna magna, there is a fluid-fluid level
consistent with layering hemorrhage. Along the left side of the
spinal canal, there is a T1 and T2 intermediate signal intensity
lesion with some blooming on the gradient echo images extending
from the mid portion of C2 through the C3 levels and measuring
approximately 3.3 x 0.9 cm in its greatest craniocaudal and AP
dimensions. This finding most likely represents hemorrhage. This
hemorrhage is distorting the left ventrolateral aspect of the
adjacent cord. This hemorrhage appears to be located within the
thecal sac as opposed to in the epidural space. This hemorrhage
may be either subdural or subarachnoid in location.

Within the superior left cerebellum is a small area of T2
hyperintensity, which may represent an area of contusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of ligamentous injury. No bone marrow edema or
loss of vertebral body heights.
2. Either left-sided subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage
extending from the C2 to the C3 level.
3. Fluid-fluid level within the posterior fossa, which likely
represents a subdural hematoma.
4. Small T2 hyperintensity of the left superior cerebellum,
which may represent an area of contusion.

COMMENT: The above findings were discussed with the trauma team
on 2006-09-07 00:00:00 at 11:00 a.m.

for

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old struck by large tree branch, + LOC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please perform exam at 1700 on 2006-09-07 00:00:00, please evaluate for
intracranial pathology
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Struck by a large tree branch and loss of
consciousness.

COMPARISON: CT head 2006-09-07 00:00:00.

FINDINGS: Compared to a day prior, there is more obvious
layering blood within the posterior horns of the lateral
ventricles bilaterally. A 123 Any St.usly described focus of high
density within a sulcus of the right temporal lobe (2:19) is
likely not significantly changed and may represent a small
amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A right middle cranial fossa
hematoma does not appear to have significantly changed in size.
More obvious today compared to a day prior is an approximately
13- mm focus of hypodensity within the left cerebellum.

123 Any St.usly described fractures including a right temporal bone
fracture extending to the skull base and right zygoma fractures
are better evaluated on the initial trauma head CT. High-density
opacification within the sphenoid sinus and mucosal thickening
within the maxillary and ethmoid sinus is again noted. Left
parietal occipital skin staples are in place with associated
swelling.

IMPRESSION:
1. High-density blood layering within the posterior horns of
lateral ventricles bilaterally is new. Unchanged appearance of
possible right temporal small subarachnoid blood and subdural
blood within the right middle cranial fossa.

2. More obvious small focus of hypodensity within the left
cerebellum may represent axonal injury or evolving infarct. MRI
may be helpful to further characterize as clinically indicated.

3. Multiple skull fractures, better evaluated on the initial
trauma head CT.

Findings discussed with Dr. Lalli at the time of dictation.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the sicu after initial ER eval.  Follow up CT
and MRI's were ordered.  He was maintained in a cervical collar.
 CT scan revealed Epidural hematoma in cervical spine.  Follow
up head Ct was stable. He was transferred to the floor on
hospital day # 3.  MRI revealed a large left sided HNP and he
was taken to the OR for and ACD at C23 on 2006-09-07 00:00:00.  His post
operative course has been uneventful.  He did have a small
subcutaneous hematoma on 2006-09-07 00:00:00 but this has remained stable.
He was seen by ENT for c/o decreased hearing in the left ear.
Their recommendations were followed and he will follow up with
them in 1 week with audiologic testing.  I reviewed CT results
with Dr. Benjimin Enerio today who states that there is no fracture
that extends through any vascular channels.  He id have post op
fever on day 2 and cultures will be followed up. Urine analysis
is negative for infection/  He agrees with the plan for d/c home
today.
