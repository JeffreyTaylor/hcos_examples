Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
History obtained from speaking with the patient's family and
review of OMR.

Ms. Boreman is a 89 year-old right-handed Boreman speaking woman
with past medical history significant for hypertension, anemia,
hypothyroidism, chronic renal insufficiency, renal cell cancer
s/p right nephrectomy and left frontal stroke in 2006-08-12 00:00:00 with
no residual deficits who presents with left sided weakness,
neglect and aphasia. She was first found this morning at 1030hrs
on 2006-08-12 00:00:00 on the floor, by her husband. It was unknown how
long she was down for.
At that time, she was able to communicate and said she couldn't
hear or see well. She did say that she tripped and fell and that
was why she was on the floor. She was also confused when she was
found; she was asking how to get to the bathroom. EMS came to
her house; by that time, she was walking, talking and reportedly
oriented, so she remained at home. During the afternoon, there
is
a question if she had a visual field cut. She was napping on and
off all afternoon, but was reportedly talking to her husband at
times and it was thought she may have not been completely acting
like herself. She was also thought to still be confused; an
example given was that she may have had trouble telling time.
Her granddaughter went to check on her at 1700hrs and at that
time, she was again found on the floor, moaning, not speaking
and nor
moving her left arm (unclear if moving left leg). Her husband
had reportedly went to the bathroom just prior to this and when
he left, she was not on the floor, though no one know with
certainity if she was moving her left arm and when the last time
was that she actually spoke. EMS was called again and brought
the patient to UPMCE. EMS notes upon finding the patient, the
left arm was 123 Any St., but she began moving it en route. Upon
arrival to UPMCE, a CODE STROKE was called.

Neuro ROS: unable to obtain from patient.

Imaging:

NCHCT, Perfusion CT 2006-08-12 00:00:00
1.  Markedly motion-limited head CT without evidence of gross
acute
hemorrhage.
2.  CT perfusion study is slightly limited, but demonstrates a
large area of ischemia in the right middle cerebral artery
territory and in the right
occipital lobe.  An infarction also appears to be present, at
least in the
superior right middle cerebral artery territory, likely smaller
in size than the area of ischemia.

Chest x-ray 2006-08-12 00:00:00
Heart size is enlarged, unchanged.  Mediastinal contour is
stable.  Lungs'
assessment demonstrates mild volume overload but no overt
pulmonary edema.
Right upper quadrant surgery is redemonstrated.

MR/A head and neck 2006-08-12 00:00:00
1.  Extensive right MCA territory infarcts and also a small
focus in the right PCA territory, without mass effect, new since
the prior study.

2.  Occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in the distal
M1 segment and nonvisualization of the rest of the middle
cerebral artery branches.

TTE 2006-08-12 00:00:00
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No definite structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of 2006-08-12 00:00:00, the severity of mtiral regurgitation and the
estimated PA systolic pressure are now higher.

Chest x-ray 2006-08-12 00:00:00
The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  Heart size and
mediastinum are
grossly unchanged.  There is newly developed left retrocardiac
opacity that
may reflect atelectasis, but infectious process or aspiration
cannot be
excluded.  No pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or ap123 Any St.ble
interval increase in pleural effusion seen.

NCHCT 2006-08-12 00:00:00
Extensive right MCA territory ischemic infarction without
evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.  Subtle hemorrhage or
extension of the
infarction may be better assessed by MRI if indicated.

EEG 2006-08-12 00:00:00
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring
study because
of frequent electrographic seizures arising from the right
occipital region
and spreading to the right posterior quadrant. There are a total
of 15
seizures, lasting 1-2 minutes, most in a cluster between 17:00
and 19:03. In addition, there is continuous focal slowing with
intermixed theta and delta range frequencies, attenuation of
faster frequencies, and absent alpha rhythm in the right
hemisphere. These findings are indicative of an epileptogenic
focal structural lesion in the right hemisphere, and are
consistent with the clinical history of right MCA stroke. Some
of the focal attenuation may be secondary to postictal effects.
Background activity is slow with a slow alpha rhythm on the
left, indicative of more widespread cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically nonspecific, but may in part be secondary to
sedating medications.

EEG 2006-08-12 00:00:00
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring
study because of continuous focal slowing and attenuation of
faster frequencies in the right posterior region. These findings
are indicative of a focal structural lesion in the right
hemisphere and are consistent with the clinical history of right
MCA stroke. Background activity shows continuous generalized
background slowing in mixed theta and delta range frequencies
suggestive of moderate encephalopathy which is etiologically
non-specific. No epileptiform discharges or electrographic
seizures are present. Compared to the prior day's EEG, faster
frequency activities have started to appear in the right
posterior region indicating improving dysfunction in the right
posterior quadrant.

PORTABLE HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST - 2006-08-12 00:00:00 8:58 AM
IMPRESSION:  Normal changes consistent with evolution of a right
MCA
infarction.  No definitive evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation.  No
evidence of new infarction.  Chronic changes as indicated above.


EEG 2006-08-12 00:00:00
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring
study because of continuous focal slowing with absent alpha
rhythm and attenuation of faster frequencies in the right
hemisphere, maximal in the posterior quadrant. These findings
are indicative of a focal structural lesion in the right
hemisphere and are consistent with the clinical history of right
MCA stroke. Background activity shows continuous generalized
background slowing in mixed theta and delta range frequencies
along with frequent and prolonged runs of triphasic waves
indicative of moderate encephalopathy which is etiologically
non- specific. Compared to the prior day's EEG, there is no
significant change


Brief Hospital Course:
89yo RHF (2006-08-12 00:00:00 speaking only) h/o L Frontal Stroke, HTN,
Hypothyroid, Anemia, Chronic Renal Insufficiency c/b RCC s/p R
nephrectomy p/w L weakness, neglect, and global aphasia with
imaging suggestive of dual R MCA and R PCA distribution thus
likely secondary to embolic event given pt with paroxysmal AFib
while inpatient. Course further complicated by status
epilepticus.

# Neuro:
On admission, patient had left neglect, aphasia (both productive
and receptive), right gaze preference with seeming inability to
cross the midline, left hemianopia and left hemiparesis. tPA not
given since recent stroke and Boreman onset of symptoms time as
well as recent frontal stroke.  The etiology of her right MCA
stroke was likely thromboembolic given the extent of infarct and
likely secondary to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which she was
found to be in on the floor.  Patient initially had some
improvement neurologically and was following commands, answering
questions appropriately with short words/phrases and moving her
left side to antigravity. For her stroke, she was continued on
full dose ASA and started on statin. Initially on high dose
statin, but as LDL <100, will discharge on Atorvasatin 40 mg
daily.

On 2006-08-12 00:00:00 in the afternoon, pt had rhythmic shaking of LUE and
LLE; however, she
was awake, alert, speaking and answering questions
appropriately. At ~1700, pt had a generalized tonic-clonic
seizure with unresponsiveness, L gaze preference.  Was given
ativan 1mg IV x2 with no response.  Loaded with Keppra 1000mg x1
which
resulted in transient arrest of the seizure for 1min, but then
seizure activity resumed.  Started Dilantin, and placed
prophylactic NRB with O2 sats in the high
90s. Remained in status through 1800.  BP was 95/48, started
NSD5W bolus.  At that time after confirming change in codes
status with family (pt had been DNR/DNI), called anesthesia for
elective intubation, pt was transferred to Neuro ICU.

Patient was transferred to ICU for further management after
ictal episode requiring intubation for airway protection.
Initially, she was maintained on Fentanyl/Versed which limited
evaluation of neurologic function.  Continuous EEG monitoring
revealed electrographic seizures despite any change in mental
status of the patient, or evident convulsions.  Of note, during
AM examination, the patient was noted to have no abnormal
movements or change in status from 123 Any St.us exams, but was
reported to have rhythmic epileptiform activity on EEG.  Versed
was held and propofol used due to patient's chronic renal
insufficiency.  The patient on 2006-08-12 00:00:00 was also started on Dilantin
(bolused to bring to theraputic levels).  Repeat measurements of
her Dilantin level, corrected for hypoalbuminemia, fell between
18 and 21

Ms. Boreman was weaned from propofol over 2006-08-12 00:00:00, and was
more active bilaterally in upper and lower extremities.  During
this period, EEG monitoring continued to reveal no
electrographic seizures. She opened eyes spontaneously but
remained unresponsive to command (in 2006-08-12 00:00:00).  Propofol was
used for sedation to agitiation between 2006-08-12 00:00:00, during which
patient was less responsive in examination.  Baseline agitation
was maintained also with Seroquel / Zyprexa.

After evaluation by anesthesia and a successful spontaneous
breathing trial, Ms. Boreman was extubated on 2006-08-12 00:00:00 without
event.  She remained globally aphasic not responding to commands
from relatives who are Kashmeir Boreman speaking.  On the subsequent
morning, the patient was responding with garbled phrases to her
granddaughter.  However, she remained unresponsive to command in
the morning and only opened her eyes to repeat stimulation.
Lethargy was attributed partially to sedating effects of
antiepileptics (on Keppra and Dilantin UPMCE).  Also, had fevers
attributed to Dilantin as infectious w/u was neg.  Discontinued
Dilantin, started Vimpat 50mg PO bid instead.  Decreased Keppra
dose.

She was started on Modafinil to help with her level of
alertness. She was also started on Fluoxetine as her mood
appeared depressed and given that Fluoxetine can improve 3 month
outcome after a stroke.

# Cardiopulmonary:

Overnight on admission, pt's HRs were in the high 30s to low 40s
while asleep.  On 2006-08-12 00:00:00 at ~9am, HR was 140s and she was in new
onset atrial fibrillation.  She was treated with metoprolol 5mg
IV and tachycardia resolved.  ECG was obtained and showed 1mm
depressions in V3-V6.  Cardiac enzymes, trops
0.02-->0.08-->0.06,
MB 5, 5.  Cardiology was consulted for evaluation for ACS as
well as new onset afib.  Cardiology felt that troponin leak was
secondary to demand ischemia, not ACS.  Recommended metoprolol
12.5mg UPMCE for rate control and titrate up as needed as well as
atorvastatin 80mg qd.

While in the ICU, the patient was persistently bradycardic in
the 40-50 bpm range, which per her family is baseline for the
patient.  She was able to autoregulate her pressures within
normal physiologic range without medication or intervention.

On 2006-08-12 00:00:00, the patient per the multidisciplinary ICU team was
ready for extubation; however, concern for a swollen tongue and
potential obstruction caused a delay for one day to 2006-08-12 00:00:00. Per
conversations with the family, the patient will be DNR/DNI upon
extubation.  She was administered decadron to decrease the
glossal swelling on 2006-08-12 00:00:00.  After evaluation by anesthesia
and a successful spontaneous breathing trial, Ms. Boreman was
extubated on 2006-08-12 00:00:00 without event. On discharge, she was restarted
on her home BP meds, except Diltiazem ER (she will be d/c on low
dose Metoprolol for rate control, though she is often
bradycardic, this should be held for pulse less than 60).

# Renal:

The patient's known renal insufficiency was factored into
decisions regarding her medical management, knowing that
excretion of some medications would be compromised.

# GI:

The patient had a nasogastric tube placed early during her ICU
stay for tube feeds. This got dislodged and was replaced by a
Dobhoff tube (placed by interventional neuroradiology). She was
also maintained on H2 Blockers for reflux.

# Endo:

She was on Synthroid as an outpatient. She did not receive this
for part of time during admission. TSH was checked prior to
discharge and was elevated at 8.3. She is restarted on Synthroid
at time of discharge.

# Goals of care: Had discussions with family about code status.
After initial status epilepticus, said they would not want to
intubate pt and that she was DNR/DNI.  Wanted to wait if she
would become less sedated with weaning AEDs prior to making
decision about PEG vs. comfort care.  Palliative care was
consulted.
Plan to go to LTACH with Dobhoff for feeding and determining if
she will wake up more and tolerate PO intake/rehab.
