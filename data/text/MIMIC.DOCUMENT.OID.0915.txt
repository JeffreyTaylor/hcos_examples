Pertinent Results:
Sigmoidoscopy: Mucosa: Erythema noted in the rectum consistent
with radiation proctitis. Scope advanced to distal sigmoid colon
with no bleeding identified. Brown stool was seen at this point.


Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the colon. Otherwise normal
sigmoidoscopy to distal sigmoid colon.

Recommendations: Monitor Hct and vitals. If re-bleeds, bleeding
scan. If stable, will proceed with elective colonoscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Lower GI Bleed: The patient had a few episodes of BRBPR.  His
hct never dropped below 30 and he was hemodynamically stable.
He was given 1 unit PRBC and underwent a sigmoidoscopy in the
ICU which revealed possible radiation proctitis.  In addition it
is possible he has another source of bleeding such as polyp,
tumor or diverticulosis.  He will require an elective
colonoscopy. The patient will call his PCP's office on Monday
2014-03-20 00:00:00 to set this up.   He will hold off on aggrenox until his
full colonoscopy and will discuss restarting with his PCP.

SVT: the patient had 3-5 episodes of SVT, all less than a few
minutes, which broke with vagal maneuvers.  He was started on
lopressor 25mg po tid and discharged on toprol xl 100mg daily.
His oupt cardiologist was informed of this and he has had this
in the past and has not been treated for this.  To make room for
this beta blocker his ACEi (lisinopril 40mg po daily) was held.

Discharge Diagnosis:
primary:  lower gastrointestinal bleeding
secondary:  supraventricular tachycardia


Discharge Condition:
stable, amulatory, normal mental status


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of bleeding from your
rectum.  You received one unit of blood, and your blood counts
stabilized.  A sigmoidoscopy showed that you may have some
damage from prior radiation causing the bleeding, or this may be
related to something else further in the colon.  You will need
to have a colonoscopy as an outpatient to evaluate this further.
 Your bleeding stopped, and you were discharged to home.

The following medications were changed:
1) Aggrenox was stopped - please discuss when to restart this
with
2) Metoprolol 100 XL 100 mg daily was started - this is for your
rapid heart rate
3) Lisinopril - This was stopped because metoprolol will likely
control your blood pressure.


Followup Instructions:
Your primary care doctor, Aasha Contreras, [**First Name3 (LF) **] be calling you on
Monday to arrange an appointment.  If you do not hear from him,
please call him at test@mail.com.  You will need a colonoscopy as
