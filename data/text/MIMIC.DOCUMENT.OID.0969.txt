HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 23 year old, right handed
man, who presented to the Emergency Department for evaluation
of acute stroke, was reported in his usual state of health
until about 9:45 p.m.  His daughter reports that the
patient's wife told her that he fell out of bed.  When she
got to her father's home, she noted that his speech was
slurred and that his left face was drooping. The family also
noted that the left side was weak. He was brought to UPMCE Hospital for evaluation of stroke. CT there was
unremarkable. He was transferred to UPMCE for further evaluation.

The patient went into flash pulmonary edema and was intubated
at UPMCE Emergency Department.
He was transferred to neurologic Intensive Care Unit where he
was diuresed a total of four liters.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram was done and showed ejection fraction of 25%.
Heparin was started.  Swallow studies were difficult due to a
lack of cooperation. He pulled out the nasogastric tube five
times.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Angina, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, arthritis, coronary artery disease with
three vessel; status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to the obtuse marginal in 2007-12-07 00:00:00, totally occluded
left anterior descending.  Hypothyroidism.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Procardia 90 mg p.o. q. day.
Atenolol 15 mg p.o. q. day.
Isosorbide 30 mg p.o. q. day.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  None.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at home with his wife. Idell Betti was
retired for 25 years.  He does a lot of gardening. He quit
tobacco 30 years ago but has a five pack year history.  He
denies any alcohol or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.4; blood pressure
132/60; pulse of 86; respiratory rate of 18; 97% on four
liters.  Generally, this is an awake, cachectic man in bed.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Mucous membranes are dry.
No carotid bruits were noted. Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops heard.  Chest clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended. Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema
noted. On neurologic examination, he is awake and alert.  He
is oriented times two, not to date.  He follows midline
commands.  His speech is dysarthric with intact
comprehension, fluency and repetition.  On cranial nerve
examination, his pupils are 2 to 3 mm, reactive on the left
and surgical on the right.  His eyes deviate to the right.
He is unable to cross his eyes past midline to the left.  On
visual threat, he blinks on the right but not on the left.
He has a left facial droop. His tongue is midline with
elevated palate.  On motor examination:  He has decreased
tone on the left. His left side is 0 out of 5 on the arm and
2 out of 5 on the leg. He has full strength on the right
side.  Sensory examination: Intact to touch. There is double
simultaneous extension to the left.  On reflex, he is 2007-12-07 00:00:00 on
the right side except at the plantar which is 2007-12-07 00:00:00. He is 2007-12-07 00:00:00
on the left side, except for plantar which is 2007-12-07 00:00:00.  His toes
are upgoing on the left and down on the right.  Coordination
gait is deferred.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon transfer from the Intensive Care Unit,
his white count was 10.1; hematocrit of 40.4; platelets of
293; sodium of 144; potassium of 3.8; chloride 110;
bicarbonate of 23; BUN 37; creatinine 1.1; glucose of 124.
Calcium 10.6; phosphate 3.4; magnesium of 2.2; INR of 1.6;
PTT 43.8; PT 18.7.  B-12 and folate are normal.  Homocystine
is 7.  Carotid ultrasounds were negative. Transthoracic
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Neurologic:  Right MCA stroke. The
right MCA stroke was thought to be secondary to a low
ejection fraction. He was placed on heparin drip. Coumadin
was planned for but held off on due to possible PICC
placement.  His carotid ultrasound showed no evidence of clot
source.  His homocystine was normal at 7.  Later on, an ace
inhibitor was added in addition to the Coumadin as a stroke
prevention.  He was also started on a statin.

2.) Pulmonary:  Shine Stoke respiration:  The patient had a
hypernatremia that led to a primary respiratory alkalosis
through hyperventilation.  His sodium was slowly corrected.
A chest x-ray done showed no evidence of congestive heart
failure, accounting for the hyperventilation.  Initial
arterial blood gas done showed a pH of 7.5, PC02 of 24,
oxygen saturation to 11 with bicarbonate of 19.  His oxygen
then was weaned off due to the high level of oxygen.  It was
initially felt that he could possibly have another congestive
heart failure exacerbation and he was given a small dose of
Lasix; however, later on, when his ins and outs were
reassessed, it was felt that this was not the case. He
continued to be tachypneic and was regassed showing pH of
7.45, PC02 of 31, P02 of 85 with bicarbonate of 22.  It
appears that his hypernatremia led to the hyperventilation
resulting in a slight primary respiratory alkalosis.

3.) Cardiac:  Congestive heart failure.  Given the ejection
fraction of 25%, an ace inhibitor in the form of Captopril
and a beta blocker was added for better cardiac function.

4.) Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Hypernatremia.  The
patient was diuresed -4 liters while in the unit.  He is now
at a free water deficit of about 2.7 liters.  D-5 was
restarted at 75 cc an hour to bring his sodium from 163 back
down to 155.  He needs to continue to have free water boluses
now through his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
rather than intravenous fluids.  His sodium is continually
checked.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.  Given that
the patient will unlikely be able to swallow for another two
to three weeks given his stroke, he will need a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy placement.  When his medical problems
are better managed, he should go for a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy placement.

TRANSFER DIAGNOSIS:  Right MCA stroke.  Shine Stoke
respiration secondary to hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia
secondary to dehydration.  Congestive heart failure.
