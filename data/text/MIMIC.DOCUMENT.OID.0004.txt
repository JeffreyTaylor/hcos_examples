Echo 2009-11-27 00:00:00
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
2009-11-27 00:00:00, left ventricular dysfunction is new and mild aortic
regurgitation
is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 yo male with cardiac arrest 2009-11-27 00:00:00 paroxysmal high degree
AV block, s/p collapse with PEA arrest now with temp pacer
transferred to UPMCE for further mgmt and permanent pacemaker
placement.
.
1. Rhythm: paroxysmal high degree block, temp pacer placed.
reasons for initial collapse are unclear, possibly combination
of high degree av block and electrolyte disturbances, since
patient was on many K+sparing diuretics.  Tele after admission
showed V-paced with few PVCs.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement
on 2009-11-27 00:00:00 without complications.  The next day device
interrigation was satisfacotory.  CXR did not show a
pneumothorax or any acute processes.  Pt remained without
complaints and was discharged on 2009-11-27 00:00:00.  Indications for
pacer was symptomatic with high degree block.
.
2. Coronaries: risk factors, 123 Any St. risk 17%, ruled out for
MI w/trop leak but flat CKs after arrest. -Cont ASA, BB, statin
- lipids checked : total chol 122, HDL 36, LDL 68.  Continued on
lipitor 20.
- initially held ACEI given Alecxis Laberta upto Creatinine of 2.2.  Given
his hyperkalemia on presentation pt was not restarted on ACE
inhibitors as his BP was well controlled.
- Repeat Echo (see below) showed EF of 50%.  Given this event
would recommend an outpatient evaluation by cardiologist for
likely exercise stress test.
.
3. Pump: EF 2009-11-27 00:00:00 was 60% w/LAE, likely diastolic dysfunction,
mild hypervolemia w/?mild pulm edema causing mild hypoxia,
initially gentle diuresis with goals -500cc to -1L.
- Continued amlodipine and metoprolol for rate control
- held ace/arbs due to Alecxis Laberta
- echo 2009-11-27 00:00:00 showed EF of 50%.
- During the admission pt did not go onto complain any further
of Chest pain or Shortness of breath.
.
4. ARF/CRI: acute insult likely combo of triamterene and NSAIDS,
aggrevated by diuretics and ACE-I. Baseline 1.3-1.5 with
proteinuria long standing, should avoid NSAIDS for life.
-Discontinued ACE-I/ARBa and diuretics.
-Checked FeUrea, FeUrea: 36.5%, confirming ATN. spep and upep
(given anemia, pending), had u/s at UPMCE but should have
repeat as outpt to check complex cysts vs masses. Renal diet.
.
5. Anemia: new,  SPEP was negative, UPEP negative for bence
Alecxis Laberta proteins,  and iron, shows anemia likely due to renal
causes
-PCP may consider Brea Dowler as outpt given pt's age and anemia.
.
6. Thombocytopenia: new, mild and stable during the admission.
.
7. Elevated glucose: possibly continued stress response, check
FS wnl.
.
8. h/o hypokalemia:  PCP may consider Nephrologist follow up.
Would Recommend outpt mineralocorticoid XS work-up once off K
sparing diuretics for a while.
.
9. Hip pain: awaiting THR. vicodin prn. No NSAIDs due to renal
problems.

Discharge Instructions:
You have had a pacemaker placed because of electrical block in
your heart. This may have been 123 Any St.itated by kidney failure
and too much potassium in your blood. Do not take the
medications you were taking prior to this event. We have
enclosed a list of and prescriptions for your new medication
needs. Please take these as directed and discuss any changes
with your primary care doctor.
.
You have many risks for coronary heart disease. We feel you need
a stress test with imaging in the next month to make sure that
you do not have any significant need for a cardiac
catheterization. Until then, taking aspirin, your Toprol XL
(beta blocker safe in renal failure), your lipitor, and
eventually starting your lisinopril again will protect you
somewhat from heart attacks.
.
You must never take NSAID medications again. Your kidney disease
makes this dangerous. Avoid ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve,
naproxen, or ketoprofen. Talk with your doctor Brea Dowler if
you are unsure about any medications you are taking.


Followup Instructions:
1. See your primary care doctor Dr. Dowler on Friday 28th at
2:30pm, to check your potassium and creatinine levels and to
discuss everything we recommended. Have your doctor follow up on
the serum and urine protein electrophoresis that was pending
when you were discharged as well as the final report of your
echocardiogram. Talk with your doctor about your anemia and
whether or not you would need a bone marrow biopsy.

2. Go to the pacemaker DEVICE CLINIC Phone:test@mail.com
Date/Time:2009-11-27 00:00:00 11:30

3. You should see our nephrologists sometime for your kidney
disease. Talk with your primary doctor about this and call for
an appointment test@mail.com.

4. You should also setup an appointment with a cardiologist to
have a exercise stress test done as outpatient.  You can speak
with your PCP regarding Brea Dowler cardiologist or you can call UPMCE at test@mail.com to setup an appointment here.
