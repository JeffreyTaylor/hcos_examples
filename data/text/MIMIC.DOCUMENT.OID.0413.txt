Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Aubren Czerepak
Chief Complaint:
Left Occipital Epidural Hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Evacuation of left occipital epidural hematoma


History of Present Illness:
50yo WF with PMH significant for cervical disc herniation
that presented to outside neurosurgeon 2-2.5 weeks ago for
evaluation. Following that appointment for which no intervention

was pursued, patient started to have episodes of falling to the
ground with any attempt at standing up. Patient denied HA,
seizure activity/symptoms, LOC, or lightheadedness with each
episode, simply stating that "the world started to spin around"
whenever she experienced one of these episodes; pt did c/o
occasional nausea and retching with the episodes. Pt began to
require balance assistance to stand each time, and still had
multiple episodes of going to ground resulting numerous
abrasions, and three broken ribs. On the evening of 2006-09-30 00:00:00,
patient
had another episode resulting in a backward fall onto a concrete

slab that did not cause LOC but was worrisome enough for patient

to contact her PCP who told her to have a low threshold for
visiting an ER. On morning of 2006-09-30 00:00:00, with no resolution of sxs
patient was seen at OSH where CTH showed large left occipital
EDH.

CTH 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Large left epidural hematoma with adjacent mass effect,
cerebral
edema, compression of the ventricle and concern for uncal
herniation

CTH 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Interval drainage of epidural hemorrhage. No evidence
of new
bleeding.

CTH 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Unchanged pneumocephalus in the left supratentorial
epidural
space. Stable small epidural hematoma in left posterior fossa.
No new
hemorrhage or evidence of major vascular territorial infarction
or
hydrocephalus.

CT C-Spine 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Abnormality at the left C1-C2 facet, of
uncertain age. The lytic and sclerotic appearance could be
consistent with a less acute process, although an acute injury
cannot be excluded

Plain Films Bilateral Knees 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Unremarkable radiographs of the
bilateral knees

Plain Films Bilateral Ankles 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Acute left lateral malleolar
avulsion fracture. Left medial malleolar tiny avulsion fracture
of uncertain chronicity (no soft tissue swelling). Clinical
correlation needed.
No right ankle fracture. Right calcaneal tuberosity is excluded
from the
image.

MRI C-spine 2006-09-30 00:00:00 Small right-sided foraminal disc herniation at
C6-C7 level possibly contacting the right exiting Dejahnae Antuna nerve root.
Small left paracentral disc herniation at C5-C6 level. T2
hyperintensity involving the right facet joint at C3-C4 and
C4-C5 levels with slight hyperintensity within the right C3
pedicle. This could be related to possible osseous contusion and
neck injury. No definite fractures are identified; however,
thin-section CT might be useful for further imaging to detect
any suspected subtle fractures


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient taken directly from ER Trauma bay on 2006-09-30 00:00:00 to OR for
emergent evacuation of large left occipital epidural hematoma.
Pt tolerated the procedure well and was transferred after
stabilization in the PACU to ICU.  Pt was maintained in ICU in
stable condition until HD 3 (POD #1) at which time head drain
was removed, patient was transfused two pRBC's for anemia, and
transferred to step-down UPMCE 5.  Based on C1-C2 facet joint
irregularity seen on CT c-spine, Spine Consult was obtained, and
with f/u MRI of spine, it was determined that the patient needed
to maintain hard c-spine collar on for 6 weeks, until follow up
with ortho123 Any St. spine.  On HD4, ortho123 Any St.s was consulted for
left ankle fx and their recommendations were to place patient
leg in air splint, with weight bearing on foot as tolerated.  Pt
was transferred to regular floor status on 2006-09-30 00:00:00 while awaiting
PT and social work recommendations.

Pt continued to have headaches a repeat head CT was done on
2006-09-30 00:00:00

Neurology saw patient for vertigo they felt shecharacteristics
of this patient's dangerous and disabling vertigo do have a
peripheral vestibular not central quality. The features are not
lateralized enough to suggest vertebrobasilar vascular
insufficiency, nor are there the assoc. features of this DX. The

gradual escalation of symptoms is not compat. with stroke, but
also not with most of the acute labyrinthitidies, and is also
not typical of vertigo due to demyelinating disease. Rather I
suspect an otovestibular condition such as Meniere's disease, or

a more subacute process such SLE . Doubt mass lesion as the
hearing loss (if indeed not directly due to resolving
hemotympanium) is spontaneously remitting.

Antuna.: In view of her severe multiple trauma, hemotympanium,
neck
Antuna, [**First Name3 (LF) **] not feel it useful, practicable or safe to begin a
diagnostic evaluation of this patient's vertigo. Both hearing
testing (site of lesion) and otovestibular testing must be
delayed until cervical stability is established. Until then her
vertigo must still be considered to place her at risk for
further
un123 Any St.table falls, and life-threatening injury. Until a
definitive W/U can be realized, I would therefore recommend that

she be placed in Rehab (123 Any St.-Healthcare South would be
ideal because of the excellent otovestibular lab. there) or at
the very least, a UPMCE facility until w/u can proceed.
