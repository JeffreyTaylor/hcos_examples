History of Present Illness:
64 year-old female with hypertension admitted 2010-10-03 00:00:00 with acute
renal failure secondary to hydralazine-induced
glomerulonephritis (p-ANCA positive). Patient was initially
nonresponsive to steroids, plasma exchange, and was started on
hemodialysis on 2010-10-03 00:00:00. She received her second HD treatment on
2010-10-03 00:00:00. During both treatments L IVF was removed. Both renal
and rheumatology have followed patient to date. Cyclophosphamide
was considered, but not started given concern for toxicity due
to age.
.
Overnight, patient developed oxygen requirement, initially
hypoxic to 90% on room air at rest, 85% with ambulation. Oxygen
delivery was increased progressively from 3L to 6L nasal
cannula. She appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR. She was
given Lasix 40mg IV x2 with minimal urine output. Nebulizers
were tried with minimal relief. Renal was called re: urgent
dialysis, which was not possible. Additionally, given rapid
progression of hypoxia, renal suspected etiology other than
volume overload alone. Of note, patient also with hemoptysis
this morning on multiple occasions - largest approximately 1
teaspoon bright red blood. Given progressive hypoxia and
increased work of breathing, patient is transferred to UPMCE for
further management.
.
Hospital course also complicated by lower GI bleed, anemia,
coagulopathy, UTI. On 2010-10-03 00:00:00, patient developed LGIB in context
of constipation and straining for bowel movement. GI was
consulted. Based on recent colonoscopy, transient diverticular
bleed was suspected. Ischemic colitis was also considered given
underlying vasculitis. Patient also with chronic anemia. She has
required 2 pRBC transfusions during this hospital course.
Patient also with uncomplicated UTI treated with ciprofloxacin
PO x3 days on admission.
.
On arrival to UPMCE, was with O2 saturation 100% on 100% O2
shovel mask. She complained of shortness of breath, fatigue. She
was urgently intubated given respiratory distress.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yo female with history of hypertension was admitted with acute
renal failure, coagulopathy, and microscopic hematuria of
unclear etiology.

1. Acute renal failure
Initially, the etiology of her acute renal failure was unclear.
Initial evaluation with urine electrolytes, renal ultrasound,
and renal ultrasound with doppler evaluation made pre-renal
etiology or post-renal etiology less likely. Urine sediment was
generally unremarkable. Renal biopsy was pursued and
demonstrated crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of
ANCA positivity. Etiology of her renal failure was found to be
hydralazine-related pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Shortly
after admission, she was started on hemodialysis and did not
demonstrate any signs of renal recovery. The decision was made
not to continue dialysis.

2. Coagulopathy.
Her INR was slightly elevated to 1.3 on admission and had
minimal improvement with Vitamin K administration. PTT remained
markedly elevated. Mixing study and lupus anticoagulant testing
was performed and were both positive. However, the diagnosis of
lupus anticoagulant was not deemed relevant to the above
diagnosis.

3. Anemia:
Patient was found to have anemia related most likely to anemia
of chronic disease and chronic kidney disease.

4. Hypertension. Patient was initially continued on her home
regimen for hypertension with the exception of her Turowski which was
held due to renal failure. However, when ANCA came back as
positive, her hydralazine was discontinued given the known
association between pauciimmune ANCA positive glomerulonephritis
and hydralazine usage. She was then placed on labetalol with
improvement in her blood pressure.

5. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage
During this admission, she developed an oxygen requirement and
hemoptysis, concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She was
started on high dose steroids and cytoxan with remarkable
improvement in her respiratory status from intubation to being
on room air.

6. GI Bleding
Patient had an episode of GI bleeding during this admission
thought likely related to hemorrhoids, diverticuli, or ischemia
in the setting of vasculitis. These symptoms did not recur
during her hospitalization.

7. Thrombocytopenia
Platelet count declined and patient was found to be HIT
positive. Her platelet count remained between 80-150.

8. Goals of Care
Prior to admission, patient was living independently with some
help from her daughter. Over the course of her admission, she
became remarkably weak and dependent for her activities of daily
living, in addition to being dialysis dependent. After extensive
discussion with her family, she was transitioned to comfort care
and the plan was for her to be sent home with hospice. Prior to
discharge, she was noted to be in more respiratory distress,
with shallow respirations. Removal of her central line was
required before discharge, and in discussion with the family
about the risks of taking the patient off the floor for the
procedure, it was determined that the goal of getting the
patient home was worth the risk. While in the IR suite, the
patient expired.
