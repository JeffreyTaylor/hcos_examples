History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
Ms. 123 Any St.usly PD until
2014-06-26 00:00:00) for ESRD secondary to type 1 DM for the past 3 years.
Per her mother with whom she lives, she developed a headache,
hypoglycemia, nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain with chills
over the past day.  She was also more combative and somnolent at
home.  She did have HD on Thursday as scheduled and per a
nephrology census note, has a history of catheter infections.
She was brought in by ambulance to the UPMCE for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 100.4 90 test@mail.com. Patient
underwent LP after receiving Vanc, CTX and acyclovir and blood
cultures.  CSF unrevealing.  The patient also underwent Head CT
and CXR.  She was slated for CT Ab/Pelvis with IV contrast to
evaluate her abdominal pain given her recent hernia repair
(despite her mother's protestations) and during the contrast
exposure, developed rapid facial swelling, oropharyngeal rash
without wheezing or hives.  She was given Solumedrol,
Famotidine, Benadryl and 1L NS for allergic reaction and
transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.  CT Ab with PO
contrast was obtained prior to transfer. Renal was consulted. VS
ib transfer: 87 199/93 14 100% RA- no headache or chest pain.
.
On the floor, the patient is somonolent but arousable.  She is
tacitly refusing to answer questions but does respond to
commands and express her displeasure at my attempt to interview
her.  A brief meeting with her mother confirmed the story above.

Imaging:
CXR (2014-06-26 00:00:00): IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. Dialysis
access recently replaced,
but otherwise no interval change noted.

CT Head w/o contrast (2014-06-26 00:00:00): IMPRESSION: Normal head CT, without
acute intracranial process.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/o contrast (2014-06-26 00:00:00):
IMPRESSION:
1.Small soft tissue density noted within the subcutaneous fat
overlying the 123 Any St.us site of ventral hernia, likely
post-surgical changes. No evidence of abscess or colitis.
2. Focal ground glass opacity in right lower lobe could be due
to edema, infectious or inflammatory change. Small left pleural
effusion.
3. Small amount of intermediate density free fluid in the
pelvis, a nonspecific finding. If there are symptoms referable
to the pelvis then pelvic ultrasound would further evaluate.

Abdominal u/s (2014-06-26 00:00:00):IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with
surgical mesh material in the anterior abdominal wall at the
site of hernia repair with adjacent hypoechoic vascularized
tissue that may represent scarring or keloid. No evidence of
bowel containing hernia. Continued clinical followup with
palpation is recommended. If the mass continues to grow, then
further assessment could be obtained with MRI.


Brief Hospital Course:
30F on HD for ESRD 2014-06-26 00:00:00 type 1 DM who p/w headache,
nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain, whose hospital course was
complicated by an anaphylactic rxn to IV contrast. The patient
was started on vancomycin/cefepime/cipro for fevers and
leukocytosis, but no source of infection was found.
.
1) Abdominal pain and fevers: The patient presented with a
diffusely tender abdomen, fevers, and leukocytosis. There was
concern for intraabdominal process given recent PD catheter
removal and hernia repair. CT abdomen with contrast was
complicated by allergic reaction (described below). CT
abd/pelvis without contrast showed no evidence of abscess or
colitis. There were no clear localizing findings on physical
exam. The patient received a course of vancomycin, cefepime, and
ciprofloxacin; all were discontinued when the patient remained
afebrile for >48 hours. The patient's pain, fevers, and white
count resolved by the time of discharge.
.
2) Contrast reaction:  The patient developed rapid facial
swelling, oropharyngeal rash without wheezing or hives upon
administration of IV contrast. She was given Solumedrol,
Famotidine, Benadryl and 1L NS for allergic reaction and
transferred to the ICU for further monitoring. There was no
evidence of respiratory compromise, and did not require
intubation during her hospital course. The patient's facial
swelling resolved during the course of her hospital stay.
.
3) Type 1 DM: The patient developed hyperglygemia in the setting
of steroid administration during her allergic reaction. The
patient had consistent BS readings in the 400s while in the ICU.
There was no evidence of anion gap acidosis. Once the patient
arrived on the floor, Sower was consulted to help manage her
diabetes. The patient's dose of lantus was adjusted, but
ultimately she remained well-controlled on her home dose of
lantus and ISS.
.
4) Headache: The patient presented with severe headache, that
resolved by day 3 of hospital course. A LP performed in the ED
was negative for infection.
.
5) ESRD on HD: The patient underwent HD as an inpatient as per
her schedule. The patient's lisinopril dose was reduced from
40mg to 10mg as per Renal recommendation.
.
6) HTN: The patient's SBP ranged from 140-200 during the course
of her hospital stay. The higher numbers were attributed to pain
that the patient was experiencing.

underlying infection.

Please CHANGE the following medications:
From LISINOPRIL 40mg daily to LISINOPRIL 10mg daily.

Folic Acid
Lasix (Furosemide)
