CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old man with
history of advanced dementia (Alzheimer's type) and type 2
diabetes mellitus, presenting to the Emergency Department
with fever, cough, hypoxemia.  The patient was noted by
caregivers to be more lethargic than usual and with nasal
congestion on the night prior to admission.  On the day of
admission, the patient was more lethargic, "gurgling", with
cough nonproductive.  No witnessed aspiration or choking
episode.  The patient was unable to localize his complaints
(he is nonverbal at baseline).  Due to increased gurgling,
the caregivers brought the patient to the Emergency
Department, where he was found to be in respiratory failure.
Specifically, his temperature was 102.3, his heart rate 112,
his blood pressure 142/80, respiratory rate 20 and his oxygen
saturation was 82% in room air and 90% on six liters of
oxygen nasal cannula and 94% on 100% face mask.

In the Emergency Department, suction of secretions was
affected and the chest x-ray showed right middle lobe and
right lower lobe process.  The patient was treated with
Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone in the Emergency Department and
reattempts to suction his airways gave very little yield.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dementia (Alzheimer's type) for the past ten years).  The
patient is essentially nonverbal and he requires 24 hour care
by his caregivers.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Diverticulitis, status post colectomy in 2013-11-05 00:00:00.
4.  History of hypertension.
5.  History of coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amaryl.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit tobacco use fifteen years
ago after twenty to thirty year tobacco use history.
Negative for alcohol use.  The patient lives at home with his
caregivers who provide full support for his activities of
daily living.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 102.3, pulse 112, blood
pressure 142/80, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 82%
in room air, and 90% at six liters nasal cannula oxygen and
94% on 100% face mask.  In general, the patient is awake,
alert, nonverbal with occasional words, making eye contact
with his caregivers.  Brekin Alldredge accessory muscle use.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat is notable for dry mucous membranes and
visible thick sputum in the posterior oropharynx.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Lungs - auscultation difficult because of poor
respiratory effort secondary to patient not following
commands. Trace rhonchi.  No wheezes.  The abdomen is soft
with mild diffuse tenderness, manifested by withdrawal and
grunts from the patient.  Positive bowel sounds.  Guaiac
negative per Emergency Department note.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.0, hematocrit
46.0, platelet count 163,000.  Sodium 138, potassium 5.1,
blood urea nitrogen 22, creatinine 1.0, glucose 189.

Chest x-ray revealed a density at the right middle lobe and
right lower lobe.  No congestive heart failure and no
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the UPMCE, in particular, to the Intensive
Care Unit, for treatment of his respiratory failure, which
was attributed to pneumonia and sepsis secondary to
aspiration.  The patient was treated with Levofloxacin and
Flagyl and was weaned from 100% face mask to 60% face mask.
After one day stay in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
was transferred to the medical floor on face mask 60%.  There
he was treated with Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin.  A bedside
swallow evaluation demonstrated delayed wet cough and delayed
initiation of swallow at least for liquids.  Oropharyngeal
video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation demonstrated
intermittent mild delay in initiation of pharyngeal swallow,
mildly reduced laryngeal elevation, mildly reduced epiglottic
deflection and trace penetration of thin liquids twice.  The
patient was discharged back to home with services.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Glimepiride 1 mg once daily.
2.  Subcutaneous Heparin 5,000 units q12hours.
3.  Senna one tablet twice a day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Clindamycin 600 mg q6hours for ten days.
6.  Cefpodoxime Proxetil 200 mg q12hours for ten days.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient's caregivers were advised to
provide him with a diabetic diet and to follow aspiration
precautions.  They were advised to feed the patient thin
liquids and soft solids and to avoid mixing consistencies
because that would increase the risk of aspiration.  Feeding
the patient should always be performed in the upright
position and with monitoring for signs and symptoms of
aspiration.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.
