History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 45 yo F with PVD, DM, HL, HTN and OSA. no known
CAD, no history cath who presents with chest pain and pressure
for 5 days. Patient was last in her usual state of health 5 days
prior to admission when she began to feel an intense chest
pressure and heaviness in the left chest radiating up to the jaw
while walking to her car. At this time she also felt intense
nausea. The pain and nausea abated on its own but recurred more
intensely that night accompanied with vomiting. At home, she
took one of her boyfriend's nitroglycerin which brought about
partial relief of pain. She continued over the weekend to have
pain, nausea, and vomiting recurring which was relieved with her
boyfriend's nitroglycerin. In total, she reports taking 7 nitros
for these episodes over the weekend. She had progressive fatigue
as the days progressed, and on day of presentation took a
shower, after which she felt extreme pronounced fatigue which
prompted her to present to the hospital. She reports worsening
orthopnea and DOE. Also, while she was on full dose aspirin due
to PVD, has not taken it while being on coumadin.

STRESS MIBI 2011-03-22 00:00:00:
INTERPRETATION: This was a 45 year old DM2 woman with PVD, HTN
and
HLD who was referred to the lab from the ED after negative
serial
cardiac enzymes for an evaluation of chest discomfort. She
received
0.142mg/kg/min of IV Persantine infused over 4 minutes. She
complained
of mid-sternal chest pressure and nausea immediate post
Persantine
infusion, which was relieved with the administration of 125mg IV

Aminophylline. There were no changes in ST segments or T waves
noted
during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus without
ectopy.
The heart rate and blood pressure responded appropriately to the

Persantine infusion. At 2:15 post infusion, 125mg IV
Aminophylline was
given to reverse the Persantine side effects.

IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes. Persantine induced symptoms

reported. Appropriate hemodynamic response. Nuclear report sent
separately.

MIBI Report 2011-03-22 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. New partially reversible inferior wall mild perfusion defect.

2. Normal left ventricular wall motion and cavity size. LVEF
62%.

Cardiac Cath 2011-03-22 00:00:00:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was patent. The
LAD had
a 30% mid segment stenosis. The Lcx was patent with no
angiographically
apparent disease.  The RCA was tortuous with diffuse disease.
There was
a 40% proximal lesion and a 40% mid lesion.  There was a 95% mid
to
distal lesion.
2.  Limited hemodynamics revealed centralized systolic
normotension.
3. Successful PCI with 6 Integrity BMS to the RCA (from the
distal
bifurcation to the ostium) complicated by spiral dissection
which had
completely been treated with the stents; no residual dissection.

4. Terumo band to right radial artery.
5. Integrillin for 12 hours post-cath.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI to the RCA with six Integrity BMS.
3. No post-procedure complications.
4. Patient to remain on aspirin indefintely and clopidogrel for
at least
1 year, uniterrupted, however duration of coumadin to be
established.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
Patient is a 45 yo female with PMH of PVD, DM, HL, HTN and OSA
and no known h/o CAD who was admitted for unstable angina and
found to have new partially reversible inferior wall mild
perfusion defect on stress MIBI. She underwent PTCA 2011-03-22 00:00:00 which
revealed diffuse RCA disease with 95% mid-distal lesion.
Catheterization was complicated by RCA dissection, and treated
with 6X BMS. She had trop peak to 0.28 post transfusion, was
observed in the CCU overnight with uncomplicated course, and
transfered back to the cardiology floor. She remained chest pain
free but had ongoing chronic right shoulder pain. She was
discharged home on aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, ace
inhibitor, and a statin.

ACUTE CARE:
1. Unstable angina: Patient had chest pain and pressure for 5
days at home that was partially relieved by her boyfriend's
nitroglycerin. On presentation, she had normal cardiac enzymes
and no ecg changes. Stress MIBI showed new partially reversible
inferior wall mild perfusion defect. She received cardiac
catherization, where a 95% mid-to-distal RCA lesion was stented
with 6 BMS, complicated by spiral dissection that was completely
treated with the stents.  Patient was on Integrilin for 12 hours
post-cath.  Cardiac enzymes were followed to peak.  She was
continued on Aspirin 325, plavix 75 daily, rosuvastatin 40mg,
metoprolol 12.5 PO BID.

2 DVT: Patient presented with DVT one month prior to admission.
On this admission, PE was ruled out by CTA. Per Dr. Amista Sienknecht, her
Saner surgeon, as this was a limited tibial vein DVT, can
stop coumadin now that she is on aspirin and plavix and patient
would have increased risk of bleeding. Coumadin was stopped and
coags trended until INR normalized. Bilateral lower extremity
ultrasound also showed no DVT. Workup for potential
hypercoagulable state was deferred to outpatient treatment.

CHRONIC CARE:

1. Shoulder pain: Patient is followed by rehabilitative services
for chronic right shoulder pain. Patient was treated for this
pain with oral opioid analgesics and was discharged on home
vicodin. She was scheduled for shoulder injection in the week
after discharge.

2. Diabetes type 2: Patient is on oral hypoglycemics at home.
A1c 7.2% at the end of 2011-03-22 00:00:00.  Patient was maintained on
home Lantus 28U at night plus Novolog ISS (humalog should not be
used in the setting of latex allergy).  Home oral hypoglycemics
were held throughout admission and restarted on discharge.

3. PVD: Patient takes cilostazol at home, which was held in the
setting of dissection and 2 other antiplatelet agents: plavix
and aspirin. Per patient's [**Year (4 digits) 1092**] surgeon, Dr. Amista Sienknecht, this
should be restarted later, as it does not add additional
bleeding risk. Patient was discharged on her home cilostazol.

4. HLD: Patient was continued on her home crestor.

5. HTN: Patient was continued on her home lisinopril, and
started on metoprolol.

6. OSA:  Patient was noted to snore and have oxygen
desaturations overnight on the floor.  She has never been
evaluated for OSA and is not on CPAP. Workup was deferred to
outpatient providers.

Transitions in Care:

1. CODE STATUS: FULL
2. MEDICATION CHANGES:
   1. START Plavix 75mg tablet, please take 1 tablet by mouth
daily until instructed otherwise by your cardiologist (you will
need to be on this medication for at least one month).

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Saner,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. You were admitted
for evaluation of chest pain was though to be due to narrowing
of your coronary arteries. You underwent stress test followed by
coronary catheterization which confirmed narrowing of your right
coronary artery. The catheterization of this artery was
complicated by dissection of the wall of the artery and a
temporary interuption of blood supply to the heart muscle which
was fixed with six bare metal stents. You are being discharged
with several medication changes and with cariology follow-up.
.
Please make the following changes to your medications:
1. START Plavix 75mg tablet, please take 1 tablet by mouth daily
until instructed otherwise by your cardiologist (you will need
to be on this medication for at least one month).
2. START Metoprolol 25mg tablet, please take half (0.5) a Tablet
twice daily.
3. START Nicotine patch, please use one patch daily, start with
21mg patches for the first six weeks, then use 14mg patches on
weeks seven to eight and 7mg patch for weeks nine to ten.
4. STOP taking Warfarin (Coumadin).
5. CHANGE  Aspirin from 81mg daily to 325mg once daily.
6. STOP taking chantix, this medication may increase the risk
for heart attack.
7. START Miralax 17g packet. Take one packet in water 1-2 times
daily as needed for constipation
8. CHANGE vicodin to 1 tablet every four hours as needed for
right shoulder pain. Do not take more than 7 tablets in a day.
9. Start pantoprazole 20mg, one tablet once daily.
.
Please continue the rest of your home medications without
change.
