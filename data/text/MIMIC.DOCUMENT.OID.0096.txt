Chief Complaint:
Hip and patellar fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF of right patella fx
ORIF of right femoral neck fracture


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mr. Bressi is a 78 year old male with extensive medical
history, who uses a RLE prosthesis for ambulation s/p R BKA from
PVD, who presents s/p fall when his prosthesis slipped out of
place, found to have R patellar and non-displaced fracture of
the R femoral neck, here for possible orthopedic surgery.  His
medical problems notably include CAD s/p CABG in 2010-04-09 00:00:00, MI 2010-04-09 00:00:00,
MIBI with fixed and reversible defects in 2010-04-09 00:00:00, CHF with EF 20%,
PVD s/p R BKA with b/l iliac stents, AAA found to be 5.4 x 5.0
cm on recent abdominal US, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
bovine AVR, and CRI, on coumadin for his iliac stents and PAF.

Patient reports that at baseline he is able to walk about 2
blocks, and activity is limited by SOB.  He feels SOB getting
out of bed in the morning.  He is able to climb a flight of
stairs without difficulty.  He denies orthopnea or LE edema.  No
recent weight gain.

3) PVD s/p R BKA and b/l iliac artery stents
4) Carotid stenosis s/p R CEA

8) AAA 5 x 5.4 cm
9) S/P AICD
10) Hypercholesterolemia
11) CRI (baseline approx. 1.3)
12) PAF

Social History:
Lives at home alone, independent.  Quite smoking 8 years ago but
50 pack year smoking hx.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
98.2, 68, 100/48, RR15, 98% on RA
Gen:  Cachectic appearing elderly male, resting comfortably in
bed, appearing in pain with movement.
Neck: No JVD.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g.
Lungs: CTA b/l.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND
Extr: No c/c/e.  R BKA.  Swollen, erythematous R knee,
exquisitely tender.  Trace PT on the L.

Pertinent Results:
2010-04-09 00:00:00 AP, LATERAL AND SUNRISE VIEWS OF THE PATELLA: No prior
studies are available for comparison. There is a horizontal
fracture through the patella with 1.2 cm of displacement of the
fragments anteriorly. There is a small joint effusion. There are
changes from prior BKA, and extensive 2010-04-09 00:00:00 calcifications
are present.
IMPRESSION: Horizontal patellar fracture with 1.2 cm of
displacement anteriorly.

2010-04-09 00:00:00 PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS: There is a transverse
lucency through the femoral neck, which may represent a
nondisplaced fracture. No other fractures or dislocations are
identified. Degenerative changes of the SI and hip joints are
noted. There is diffuse demineralization. Extensive 2010-04-09 00:00:00
calcifications and iliac stents are noted.
IMPRESSION: Transverse lucency through the femoral neck, which
may represent a nondisplaced fracture.

2010-04-09 00:00:00 CT PELVIS:  There is a nondisplaced fracture of the
proximal right femoral neck. No other fractures or dislocations
are identified. There is diffuse osteopenia. There is a small
amount of high attenuation fluid within the right hip joint
space, which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage.
Extensive 2010-04-09 00:00:00 calcifications are seen as are bilateral
iliac stents. Visualized portions of the pelvis are
unremarkable. Soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced fracture of the right femoral neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with extensive medical history, notably
including CAD s/p CABG in 2010-04-09 00:00:00, MI 2010-04-09 00:00:00, MIBI with fixed and
reversible defects in 2010-04-09 00:00:00, CHF with EF 20%, PVD s/p R BKA with
b/l iliac stents, AAA found to be 5.4 x 5.0 cm on recent
abdominal US, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who uses a RLE
prosthesis for ambulation s/p R BKA, who presents s/p mechanical
fall with R patellar and R femoral neck fractures, here for
orthopedic surgery.

1) Ortho:  Patient is high risk for surgery, however per ortho,
surgery will not be extensive, could be completed in relatively
short time frame, possibly under spinal anesthesia only.
Awaiting cardiolgy consult for estimate of operative risk given
recent MIBI with reversible defects in all territories, and cath
with 3VD.  Patient willing to accept 25-30% chance of operative
mortality.  [**Year (4 digits) **] has seen patient and says o.k. for surgery.
 Limiting factor may be INR, as still 2.9 with 5 mg Vitamin K.
Another 5 mg given, but may need FFP/platelets, and given EF
30%, would likely need to be done under controlled setting in
ICU in case of respiratory distress.  2010-04-09 00:00:00 defer until tomorrow.
Needs patellar surgery one way or another in order to ever be
able to use prosthesis again.

2) AAA:  Seen by 2010-04-09 00:00:00.  Will try to get CTA during
hospitalization at some point, though not now in setting of
worsened creatinine.  2010-04-09 00:00:00 just be able to get abdominal US.
Ap123 Any St.te 2010-04-09 00:00:00 consult.  Outpatient repair of AAA.

3) CHF:  Class Bressi, [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20% in past, though 30% on most recent
cath, currently dry on exam, therefore holding lasix.  If
patient doesn't go to surgery tonight, will order food and will
likely order lasix then.  Also will need lasix with any
FFP/platelets.
-Coumadin for goal INR 2010-04-09 00:00:00

4) PVD:  Bilateral iliac stents, on coumadin, therefore once INR
below 2, will have to start heparin drip.
--recheck INR post second dose of vitamin K, if < 2.0, will
start heparin, and d/c prior to surgery

5) A-fib: As above, holding coumadin.

6) CRI:  Slightly above baseline.  Holding ACE-I.

7) FEN:  K borerline therefore holding ACE-I.  No fluids.  Will
order food if pt. doesn't go to OR.

8) Code: Full.

9) PPx: Heparin drip then transfer to coumadin, senna, colace.

Removed RIJ CVL and placed peripheral IV on 2010-04-09 00:00:00. Hct 29.7 on
discharge. Needs daily Hct and INR. Transfuse Hct<28 and keep
INR 2010-04-09 00:00:00.
