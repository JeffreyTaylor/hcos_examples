CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-04-17 00:00:00 10:02 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p removal of chest tubes

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old woman pod 2 s/p MVR, now s/p chest tube removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p removal of chest tubes
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Mitral valve replacement. Status post chest tube
removal.

Single AP view of the chest is obtained 2014-04-17 00:00:00 at 10:30 hours
and compared with the prior radiograph of 2014-04-17 00:00:00 at 14:20 hours.
Patient has been extubated and chest tubes have been removed as
has a right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter. Patient is status post
cardiac surgery. Increased retrocardiac density in the left side
with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm persists and is
consistent with postsurgical atelectasis in the left base. Small
left pleural effusion may also be present. In the upper abdomen
there is colon interposition on the right side.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA
1.2-1.9cm2). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Effective
regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2. MR vena contracta is >=0.7cm
Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. An eccentric,anterior
directed jet and a central jet are seen The effective
regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion. No mitral regurgitation is
seen.
2. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. 123 Any St. is still mildly decreased with no gradient (Peak of 12 mm
of Hg).
4. Other findings are unchanged


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on 2014-04-17 00:00:00 where she underwent a
MVR. She was transferred to the ICU in stable condition. She was
extubated that night. She was transferred to the floor on POD
#2. She was confused intermittently and required a sitter.  Her
confusion improved, she otherwise did well postoperatively and
was ready for discharge to rehab on POD #4.
