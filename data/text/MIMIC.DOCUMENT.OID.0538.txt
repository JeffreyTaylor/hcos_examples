2.  Norvasc 5 mg twice a day.
3.  Gabapentin 300 mg q Monday, Wednesday and Friday after
hemodialysis.
4.  Tramadol 50 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n.

The patient was admitted with increasing right lower
extremity pain and low grade temperature.  Her admission
white count was noted to be 10.4 with a left shift,
hematocrit 40.0 with a platelet count of 244,000.
Prothrombin time was 13.7 and INR was 1.3 with a partial
thromboplastin time of 28.0.  She was on dialysis with a
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 74 and 6.9,
respectively.  She had an admission potassium of 7.6 which
was repeated in the Emergency Department and shown to be 8.0.
Hyperkalemia was emergently treated with calcium chloride,
bicarbonate, dextrose, insulin, Lasix as she does make some
urine, as well as emergent hemodialysis and Kayexalate.

Upon the day of admission, she went to dialysis and received
her hemodialysis.  Her potassium postdialysis was 4.1.  She
was otherwise feeling OK except complaining of persistent
right lower extremity pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her admission examination was notable
for a temperature of 100.1, pulse 90, blood pressure 158/60,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 94% in room air.  She
was a cachectic female who appeared older than her stated
age.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The sclera
were anicteric.  She had no jugular venous distention and no
carotid bruit.  The heart was regular with no gallop.  The
lungs were clear but decreased throughout.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, scaphoid, no hepatosplenomegaly, no
pulsatile masses and no bruit.  She had palpable femoral
pulses bilaterally.  Popliteal pulses were not palpable.
Distal pulses in the right lower extremity were absent. She
had some dry and wet gangrene involving the right forefoot
with a failed right first toe amputation site that clearly
had some purulent exudate.

She was admitted for intravenous antibiotics and started on
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl for her hemodialysis.
Over the next couple days, she was resuscitated adequately
and ultimately on 2008-08-30 00:00:00, she went to the operating room
and received a right below the knee amputation.
Postoperatively she did well. She was ruled out by enzymes
and kept on telemetry times 24 hours and was uneventful.  Her
postoperative white blood cell count was 9.6 and hematocrit
was 41.8.  Platelet count was 157,000.  Blood urea nitrogen
and creatinine were 58 and 6.3 with a potassium of 5.3.  Her
phosphate was noted to be elevated at 11.8.  Therefore, in
hospital medications, she had her Calcitriol stopped and she
was started on Amphojel and PhosLo.  The Amphojel was
continued for a total of three days of therapy, starting on
2008-08-30 00:00:00, and to end on 2008-08-30 00:00:00.  Over the next couple days,
her pain was appropriately controlled with Dilaudid PCA
although the patient demanded that the Dilaudid did not work
for her.  Therefore, she was requesting Morphine.  This was
given concomitantly and resulted in some mental status
changes and confusion which quickly resolved upon removal of
her narcotic.  She had a foot culture from 2008-08-30 00:00:00, that
grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Blood
cultures from 2008-08-30 00:00:00, were negative.  By postoperative day
number four, she continued on triple antibiotics.  Her
temperature maximum was 100.1, but a current of 97.4, pulse
82, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 18, 96% oxygen
saturation in room air.  Her fingerstick was mildly elevated
but she was noncompliant and was not taking a diabetic or
renal diet.   She was taking adequate p.o.  Her white blood
cell count at discharge was 9.4.  Her blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine were 52 and 6.3 with a potassium of 4.8 and
bicarbonate of 21.

At this time, her stump which had been resected back to the
level of the proximal one third of the right lower extremity
was clean, dry and intact with staples in place, no erythema,
no exudate, no evidence of hematoma and the flaps were warm.
She was deemed stable and appropriate for discharge by Dr.Bralin Houghtaling service.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. once daily.
2.  Vancomycin to be dosed at time of dialysis times two
weeks, dose for trough values less than 15.0.
3.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Gabapentin 300 mg q Monday, Wednesday and Friday after
hemodialysis.
5.  Tramadol 50 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n.
6.  Trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s.
7.  Medroxyprogesterone 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Albuterol MDI q4hours p.r.n.
9.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. once daily.
10. Calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o. once daily to be on hold until
followed up by her nephrologist.
11. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
12. Folic Acid 1 mg p.o. once daily.
13. Epogen 20,000 units q Monday, Wednesday and Friday with
hemodialysis.
14. MSIR 50 mg p.o. q12hours.
15. Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q3-4hours p.r.n. breakthrough
pain.
16. Colace and Pericolace for stool softening agents.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with Dr. Houghtaling in
approximately two to three weeks for skin clip removal.  She
will have right lower extremity remain in knee immobilizer
with a dry dressing and ace wrap to above knee region to help
immobilize and straighten her leg.  She should take part in
aggressive physical therapy and learn how to do transfers and
so forth.  Ultimately she will require outpatient sitting for
prosthesis, however, the stump cannot be used until
designated by Dr. Houghtaling.  Typically this occurs within six
to eight weeks postoperatively.  The patient is deemed
appropriate and stable for discharge.
