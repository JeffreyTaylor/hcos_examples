Attending:Diala Askea
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84yo w/PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (L sided weakness in
2010-08-14 00:00:00), chronic diastolic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, PVD p/w
BRBPR. The pt is a resident of UPMCE Rehab, where she was found
to have dark stools and abdominal pain. HCT was checked and was
found to be 30, down from 32 on 2010-08-14 00:00:00. She was transferred to
UPMCE and en route EMS noticed significant bright red blood,
systolic blood pressure trending down from 130 to 110 at UPMCE
Rehab and down to 100 in the ambulance.
.
In the ED the pt was 95.0 96 105/57 18 100% 4L Nasal Cannula.
She had significant BRBPR and was found to have HCT 25.7.
Because of a Cr 2.0 CTA was not done. The family was at bedside
and reinforced that the the pt was DNR/DNI, no CVL, but ok to
give peripheral blood. GI was made aware. She was given 2L NS,
started on protonix gtt, type and crossed, and one bag of pRBCs
was hung. On repeat, VS HR 85 BP 104/49 RR 25 O2 100% 2L NC.
.
On the floor, the patient was comfortable, A&Ox3, afebrile with
BP 151/63 HR 70 satting 100% on 2Lnc. She continued to complain
of diffuse abominal pain but no symptoms of lightheadedness,
dizziness, CP, or SOB. Her family decided that they would be ok
with CVL and intubation for procedure if necessary.
.
Of note, the pt has macroglossia and asymmetric lip swelling
that was thought to be angioedema during an admission in 2010-08-14 00:00:00.
Per the family her current appearance has been stable for
several months. The pt denies sob, increased tongue swelling,
throat swelling, or respiratory distress.
.

KUB:
PORTABLE ABDOMEN STUDY DATED 2010-08-14 00:00:00

No prior abdominal radiographs for comparison.

A nonspecific, non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is visualized.
A large
amount of stool is seen throughout the colon which appears
nondistended.
Several nondistended loops of air-filled small bowel are also
demonstrated, especially in the left side of the abdomen. There
is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Prominent vascular
calcifications are observed in the thoracoabdominal aorta and
its branches. There is also a possible rounded calcification in
the central pelvis, which could represent a calcified fibroid.
This is difficult to assess due to overlying stool in the colon.

.
Abd Xray 2010-08-14 00:00:00: IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no
evidence of intraperitoneal free air or obstruction.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo w/ PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (2010-08-14 00:00:00), chronic
diastolic heart failure, hyperlipidemia, PVD p/w hematochezia of
unknown etiology.
.
1. Hematochezia/Abdominal Pain: On admission, the patient had
BRBPR associated with diffuse abdominal pain, decreased systolic
BPs, and a HCT drop from 32-->25.7. GI was consulted and the
etiology was thought to be colitis, ischemic vs infectious.
Given her history of CAD and PVD, along with the pain out of
proportion to exam, we thought about mesenteric ischemia. Her
lactate was 4.0 on admission, but normalized with fluid and
PRBCs. In the ICU, the patient received 3u of pRBCs with
stabilization of her hematocrit. She did not get a CTA/CT
contrast because of CKD nor did she get an NG lavage. GI did not
recommend a scope at the time, as the patient was stabilized
with tranfusions and had no further signs of active bleeding.
The patient was placed on empiric cipro/flagyl, which was
switched to cefpodoxime and flagyl to cover a Proteus UTI. The
patient did not have further bleeding once she arrived on the
floor. She continued to c/o diffuse abdominal pain. We ordered a
subsequent KUB, which showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, no
obstruction, and large stool burden. The patient was transfused
one more PRBC unit on the floor for a Hct 25, and her Hct bumped
to 28 and stayed constant for the remaining 2 days of her
admission. The patient was given multiple laxatives including a
lactulose enema. She had some clotted blood with stool after the
enema, but no reason to believe that she was still bleeding. GI
signed off wanting to continue her on ABX and follow-up as an
outpatient.
.
2. Hypertension: The patient had labile blood pressures on this
admission. Her Procardia was discontinued for possible
development of slight facial swelling, possibly consistent with
mild angioedema without respiratory compromise. The patient's BP
was SBP around 200 after stopping the Procardia. Instead, the
patient was started on labetalol 200mg UPMCE. The patient had her
hydralazine increased to 50mg QID. She was continued on her
lasix and isosorbide mononitrate. Her BP on discharge was
150-160, which is acceptable for her at this time.
.
3. Angioedema: This was diagnosed in the past and hypothesized
to be secondary to CCB usage. The patient's Procardia was
stopped here. Her swelling was stable and she did not require
any intervention.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES
.
1. DM2: The patient was put on sliding scale insulin here. She
will be placed back on Glucotrol on discharge.
.
2. Chronic dCHF: No s/s of fluid overload. Patient was never
hypoxic or dyspnic during admission. Patient was continued on
her lasix and BP control.
.
3. CAD/PVD: The patient's aspirin was held during this
admission. Now that patient is HD stable, she will be restarted
on Aspirin 81mg Qday.
.
4. CKI: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, improved slightly with
gentle hydration. Patient is on Calcitriol and her electrolytes
were stable on admission.
.
5. Depression: Continued on home oxcarbazepime and duloxetine
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
.
The patient received a lactulose enema and had some blood in her
stool. This blood had clots and seemed like old blood. Her Hct
was stable since then, and there is little evidence that she is
actively bleeding. She may continue to have some old blood that
passes with her subsequent bowel movements. The geriatric fellow
discussed this with the rehab attending. GI will follow patient
in clinic. They will discuss possibility of colonoscopy in the
future.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
UPMCE for the Aged - LTC

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI bleed
Infectious Colitis


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with bleeding from your
rectum. You were initially brought to the ICU and stabilized
with blood transfusions. The GI doctors examined Chinyere Roudebush and were
not able to find a source of bleeding. They thought that there
could be an infectious component that caused colon irritation,
so you were started on antibiotics. We monitored your blood
counts and they remained stable. You did not have any more
bleeding when you were transferred to the floor. You did have
abdominal pain while here, which was due to constipation and
possibly infection. We gave you laxatives to help move your
bowels and you did have some small, loose stools. Otherwise, we
controlled your blood pressure into an acceptable range.
