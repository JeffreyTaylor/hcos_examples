Attending:Jovanna Weckbacher
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
57M with PMH of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, systolic +
diastolic CHF, CAD h/o MI, COPD on 4L home O2, 4 prior
intubations for pneumonia, p/w less than 24 hours of shortness
of breath.  He was recently admitted from 7/21-27/10 for
shortness of breath and was treated for a CHF exacerbation.  His
lasix 160 mg TID was changed to torsemide 100 mg QD and
spironolactine 12.5 mg QD, under the direction of his
cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 397**] Kochanowski.  Echo was stable (or even improved
MR) compared to prior; EF 30%.  His captopril was also increased
from 12.5 TID to 50 mg TID.  He reports that in the past he had
taken as much as 100 mg TID.
.
He reports SOB started yesterday evening after doing well for
several days at home after discharge.  His symptoms were helped
somewhat with use of BIPAP overnight.  He says his O2 req now is
6L from 4L.  He denies cough, F/C, chets pain, N/V, and change
in BMs. He says he has been taking torsemide 100 mg and
spironolactone 12.5 mg QD since discharge, and has been strict
with his diet.  He does report high diastolic BP above 90-110,
which is suboptimal.
.
On initial interview at admission, his cardiac review of
symptoms is positive for 2007-09-15 00:00:00 pillow orthopnea, SOB, DOE with 30
feet walking and less than 12 stairs, and generalized fatigue.
.
In the ED, VS were T 98.1, BP 140/71, HR 91, RR 28, 100% on 6L
NC.  He was given vancomycin 1 g x 1 and levofloxacin 750 mg IV
x 1.  He did not yet receive lasix in the ED.  EKG showed AFib,
HR 89, poor R wave progression, no ST changes.

CARDIAC CATH 2007-09-15 00:00:00:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no flow limiting lesions. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had mild plaquing
throughout and the distal LAD was noted to be a small vessel.
The Cx had mild plaquing throughout. The RCA had mild plaquing
throughout. There was a pseudostenosis of the PL branch at an
area of hyperacute angulation which made there appear to a 40%
stenosis in the R-PL branch.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right
sided filling pressures. The RVEDP was 22 mmHg and the PCWP was
24 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a PASP
of 48 mmHg. The central aortic pressure was 102/65 mmHg. The
cardiac index was low at 1.6 l/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries have no flow limiting lesions.
2. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
- 123 Any St.us to tx to MICU:
DIASTOLIC and SYSTOLIC CHF:
Mr. Kochanowski was admitted with a CHF exacerbation (acute on chronic
diastolic and new systolic). He received doses of antibiotics in
the ED for question of a pneumonia on admission CXR, though
these were not continued on the floor because clinically he did
not have a pneumonia (no fever, no cough or sputum).  He was
treated with doses of lasix 80 mg IV PRN the first several days
of admission and continued on his home dose of torsemide 100 mg
QD.  His spironolactone was increased from 12.5 mg to 25 mg.

He was re-admitted three days after his last hospital discharge,
at which point he was treated for CHF, COPD and HAP.  On that
discharge on 2007-09-15 00:00:00, his weight was stable on torsemide 100 mg
and spironolactone 12.5 mg.  His CHF exacerbation was thought to
be related to elevated diastolic blood pressure, and his
captopril had been titrated from 12.5 mg TID to 50 mg TID with
goal DBP < 80.  He was at goal by discharge, yet Mr. Kochanowski
reported elevations in his DBP from 90-100's at home in the days
between admissions.  He denied non-compliance with diet and
medications, and reports that he often gets acute onset SOB in
the evenings "just as I am getting ready for bed."

MICU 123 Any St. COURSE
# AMS: When came to until, thought possible seizure vs. infx,
vs. metabolic vs. HTN.  A head ct r/o bleed, and a metabolic
work up (tsh, b12, rpr) and infx work up (cxs) were negative.
EEG was not done.  A neuro c/s was called.  Ultimately, we feel
this was likely 2007-09-15 00:00:00 overmedication, and he will need to be
followed up in the outpt arena for titration of his sedating
medications and a possible wean.  A check of his anti-seizure
meds was normal (carbamazepine of 14.1).
.
#. Acute on chronic systolic + diastolic CHF and HTN: While on
the MICU service, we had originally stopped all of his home
antihypertensives given the hypertensive emergency that he
presented with.  He was placed on a nitro-drip and required
labetalol IV prn.  Over time, his blood pressure returned to
baseline and his home medications were restarted.  However, the
pt's home doses had to be held multiple times for hypotension,
so we decreased his dose of diltiazem.  Given the CHF, we
continued the metoprolol, captopril, spironolactone,
simvastatin, isosorbide dinitrate, and the dose will likely have
to be continually titrated on the floor.  Mr. Kochanowski also went
for cardiac cath on Monday 2007-09-15 00:00:00 due to relatively recently
diagnosed systolic component, which showed clean coronaries.  We
continued for daily weights, 1500 cc fluid restriction.
.
#. ANEMIA: considered to have ACD per heme in prior notes. Hct
stable here. no further episodes of rectal bleeding, continued
the pt on stool softeners (as he was as an outpatient), and we
were getting UPMCE Hcts, and maintained an active T/S.
.
#. Afib/History of PE & DVT/anticoagulation: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5
per OMR.
- heparin gtt was started after cath--> can bridge to coumadin.
.
#. COPD: chronic COPD
- stable symptoms. Awaiting pulm rehab as an outpatient.
#. Diabetes: diet controlled currently
#. Obstructive sleep apnea: home Bipap machine hooked up
#. Insomnia: continue on home dose of tizanidine and oxazepam.
#. SLE: continue on home dose of plaquenil.
# Chronic pain: On methadone recently decreased from 20 mg QID
to 10 mg QID under direction of Dr. Jovanna Weckbacher.  Trying to wean
medications as above, will have to follow up with Dr. Jovanna Weckbacher
regarding status of this.
.
UPMCE C (Cardiology Floor) Hospital Course:
#. Acute on chronic systolic + diastolic CHF: Patient was
agressively diuresed on torsemide 100 mg po BID and lasix iv as
needed to acheive negative output of at least 2 liters per day.
Prior to discharge, his torsemide was increased to 150 mg po BID
and he was no longer requiring iv lasix. He was  He was
clinically euvolemic with no crackles on lung exam, no JVD.
Blood pressure was aggressively managed with several medications
and prevented further worsening of his volume status. He lost
about 11 kg on the cardiology floor. His discharge weight was
100.7 kg (from 111 kg on transfer to the floor).
.
# AMS: On transfer to the floor, he was confused and lethargic
but AAOx3. His altered mental status was likely secondary to
medications. He had no focal neuro deficits and his CT head was
negative. His methadone was decreased from 10 mg po q6h to 5 mg
po q6h and then to 5 mg po q6h prn. He tolerated this adjustment
without compliant. His tizanidine was decreased from 4 mg po qHS
to 2 mg po qHS and oxazepam from 30 mg po qHS to 15 mg po qHS
and finally to 10 mg po qHS. His pregabalin was decreased from
100 mg po tid to 25 mg po tid. Once he returned to baseline
mental status, he was complaining of neuropathic pain and he was
restarted on his home dose of 100 mg po tid. He remained clear
and coherent.
.
#. ANEMIA: Work-up has been done as an outpatient and the
etiology is likely anemia of chronic disease. His hematocrit
remained at baseline throughout his stay.
.
#. Afib/History of PE & DVT/anticoagulation: He was in
rate-controlled atrial fibtillation for most of his stay. He was
anti-coagulated on coumadin 17.5 mg po qD. He had an jump in his
INR to 7 and his coumadin was held for 2 days until it dropped
below 3. He was restarted on coumadin 7.5 mg po qD. He will
follow up with the coumadin clinic at UPMCE where he
already has established care.
.
#. COPD: Remained stable throughout the hospital stay. He uses 4
L NC at home and he did no require extra oxygen while
hospitalized. He was given albuterol PRN and ipratropium for
wheezing as well as advair diskus. His COPD medications were not
altered and he was discharged on his home medications. He will
have pulmonary rehabilitation as an outpatient.
.
#. Diabetes: diet controlled, stable. No interventions this
hospitalization.
.
#. Obstructive sleep apnea: continued to use CPAP at night.
.
# Chronic pain: was well controlled on methadone 5 mg po q6h
prn. His pregabalin was initially decreased to 25 mg po tid and
then increased back to 100 mg po tid when he was complaining of
neuropathic pain.
.
# Hx of seizures: His was continued carbamazepine at 400 mg po
tid. There was concern that he dose may have been too high given
the elevated lab levels. Neuro was actively involved in this
case and asked that he be continued on his home dose. Neuro recs

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
(1) Acute on chronic systolic + diastolic CHF
(2) Acute altered mental status- now resolved.
(3) Hypertension

Secondary Diagnoses:
(1) Anemia of chronic disease
(2) Stable COPD


Discharge Condition:
On 4L NC which is baseline home O2, denies shortness of breath.
Blood pressures running ~120/80.  Discharge weight is 221.5 lbs
(100.7 kg).
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
Weigh yourself every morning, Jrew Kochanowski MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

You were admitted to the hospital with a congestive heart
failure flare.  We think this happened because your blood
pressure was too high.   Your blood pressure medications have
been changed and it was better controlled in the hospital.
Please check your blood pressure regularly and keep a log of
your blood pressures. Please bring this log to your appointments
with your doctor.

You were started on a diuretic called spironolactone that last
time you were in the hospital, and the dose of this was
increased this admission.  This medication increases the
potassium in your blood. You do not need to take as much
potassium any more.  Please only take what is on this new
medication list. We started a medication called torsemide and
stopped furosemide. Torsemide is a stronger diuretic than
furosemide and this is why the dose is lower.

While you were in the hospital, you experienced an several days
of confusion or a change in your mental status. You had a CT of
your head to look for a stroke. This test was negative. You did
not have a stroke. We think your change in mental status was due
to your medications. Your doses of methadone, oxazepam, and
tizanidine were decreased. Your dose of lyrica was decreased for
several days but then was increased when your mental status
improved.

At your last appointment, we discussed you going to pulmonary
rehab by UPMCE. Please speak to your primary doctor,
Dr. Jovanna Weckbacher about going to pulmonary rehab.

Medication Changes:
DECREASED Warfarin from 17.5 mg to 7.5 mg by mouth every day
DECREASED methadone from 20 mg to 5 mg by mouth every 6 hours
