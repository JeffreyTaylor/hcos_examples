CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 55 year old patient of Dr. Alaysiah Parisen
Middaugh referred following cardiac catheterization for coronary
artery bypass grafting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to UPMCE with chest pain in 2006-08-01 00:00:00.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  His pain was
thought not to be cardiac at that time.  The patient
presented again 2006-08-01 00:00:00, with complaints of chest pain times
two weeks.  Chest pain occurred with exertion and
occasionally at rest.  He ruled out for a myocardial
infarction and did not have any ischemic electrocardiographic
changes.  He had a stress test on 2006-08-01 00:00:00, stopped because
of chest pain and ST depression in leads I and V6.  His
rhythm was sinus.  Nuclear imaging revealed inferoapical
reversible defects with an ejection fraction of 55 percent.
Following stress test, the patient had a cardiac
catheterization done on 2006-08-01 00:00:00, which revealed two vessel
coronary artery disease.  Please see catheterization report
for full details.  In summary, the patient had extremely
short left main.  Left anterior descending coronary artery
was diffusely diseased with 50 percent proximal stenosis and
a 95 percent distal lesion.  D1 was diffusely diseased.  The
circumflex had a 30 percent proximal, large obtuse marginal
had 40 percent stenosis at the origin and the right coronary
artery was totally occluded proximally.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

Diabetes mellitus.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Unrepaired ventricular septal defect.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Rectosigmoid polyp removal.

Knee surgery times four.

Appendectomy.

2. Prazocin 2 mg twice a day.
3. Metoprolol 100 mg twice a day.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.4, hematocrit
40.8, platelet count 213,000.  Prothrombin time 12.0, partial
thromboplastin time 26.8, INR 1.0.  Urinalysis is negative.
Sodium 132, potassium 4.9, chloride 101, CO2 22, blood urea
nitrogen 26, creatinine 1.3, glucose 210, ALT 25, AST 27,
alkaline phosphatase 129, amylase 67, total bilirubin 0.6,
albumin 4.0, cholesterol 198.

Chest x-ray showed no radiographic evidence for acute
cardiopulmonary process.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He works for
American Alliance on the loading docks.  He is also a driver
for the Israeli Consulate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated 123 Any St.usly, the patient was a
direct admission to the operating room on 2006-08-01 00:00:00.  Please
see the operating room report for full details.  In summary,
the patient had coronary artery bypass grafting times four
with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal two, saphenous vein graft to diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery.  His bypass time was 78 minutes with a cross clamp
time of 67 minutes.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At that time, he was in sinus rhythm at
80 beats per minute.  He had a mean arterial pressure of 61
with a PAD of 16.  He had Neo-Synephrine at 0.3
mcg/kg/minute, insulin at two units per hour and Propofol at
30 mcg/kg/minute.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.  He
remained hemodynamically stable overnight.  On postoperative
day number one, he was weaned from all cardioactive
intravenous medications.  His Swan-Ganz line was discontinued
and his chest tubes were removed.  However, on a follow-up
chest x-ray, the patient was noted to have a pneumothorax and
he was therefore kept in the Intensive Care Unit for
pulmonary monitoring.  Postoperative day number two, the
patient continued to have periods of desaturation with little
or minimal activity.  His chest x-ray showed a small apical
left pneumothorax as well as atelectasis.  He continued to
have periods where he would desaturate and he was kept in the
Intensive Care Unit again for vigorous chest physical therapy
and pulmonary toilet.  On postoperative day number three, the
patient continued to do well.  With increasing activity and
chest physical therapy, he no longer had periods of
desaturation and therefore he was transferred to the floor
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
At that time, his temporary pacing wires were removed.  Once
on the floor, the patient had an uneventful hospital course
and on postoperative day number four, the patient's activity
level had progressed enough that he was considered ready for
discharge to home with visiting nurses.  At that time, the
patient's physical examination was as follows:  Vital signs
showed temperature 98.9, heart rate 82, sinus rhythm, blood
pressure 110/56, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96
percent in room air.  Laboratories showed a white blood cell
count 6.1, hematocrit 24.9, platelet count 293,000.  Sodium
140, potassium 4.5, chloride 103, CO2 30, blood urea nitrogen
21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 105, weight preoperatively 94.9
kilograms and at discharge 100.3 kilograms.  On physical
examination, neurologically, alert and oriented times three,
moves all extremities, nonfocal examination.  Respiratory -
diminished breath sounds in the left base and otherwise clear
to auscultation.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm,
S1 and S2, with no murmurs.  The sternum is stable.  The
incision with staples open to air, clean and dry.  The
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with
one plus edema, right saphenous vein graft harvest site with
Steri-Strips with large bullae underneath the Steri-Strips.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Metoprolol 75 mg twice a day.
2. Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg once daily.
3. Vitamin C 500 mg twice a day.
4. Metformin 500 mg twice a day.
5. Glyburide 10 mg q.a.m. and 5 mg q.p.m.
6. Plavix 75 mg once daily.
7. Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
8. Protonix 40 mg once daily.
9. Niacin 500 mg once daily.
10.      Lasix 20 mg twice a day times two weeks.
11.      Potassium Chloride 20 mEq twice a day times two
   weeks.
12.      Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting times four with left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous
vein graft to diagonal and saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending coronary artery.

Hypertension.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

Hyperlipidemia.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Diabetes mellitus type 2.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
