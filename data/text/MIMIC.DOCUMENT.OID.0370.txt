History of Present Illness:
Mr. Holwerda is a 76 year old male with chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure(aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation)
and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented to outside
hospital with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for
the last six months. He admits to occasional rest pain as well.
During that admission, he was found to be anemic and transfused
with several units of PRBC's. Endoscopy found a nonbleeding AV
malformation in the proximal duodenum. Given his above cardiac
status, he was transferred to the UPMCE for further evaluation
and treatment.

1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect of PFO is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.

2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally.

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral regurgitation
vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

7. There is no pericardial effusion.

2. A well seated, well functioning valve is seen in the mitral
position. No perivalvular leak is noted. Mean gradient 3.1 mmHg.

3. A well seated, well functioning valve is seen in the aortic
position. No perivalvular leak is noted. Mean gradient is 5.4
mmHg.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Holwerda was admitted to the cardiology service with chronic
diastolic heart failure and unstable angina. Cardiac
catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease. It was also notable for moderate-severe aortic
stenosis, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and mild
biventricular diastolic dysfunction. LV gram was deferred
secondary to his renal dysfunction. Cardiac surgery was
therefore consulted and further evaluation was performed.
Echocardiogram confirmed aortic stenosis but also revealed
severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Additional workup
included a carotid ultrasound which found a totally occluded
left internal carotid artery with a patent right internal
carotid artery stent. He otherwise remained pain free on medical
therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.

On 2011-10-13 00:00:00, Dr. Aslean Kohns performed aortic and mitral valve
replacements along with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
For surgical details, please see separate dictated operative
note. Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Extubated on POD #1 and developed melanotic
stools, has pre existing AVM in the duodeum, hematocrit remained
stable was started on protonix with no further issues.  Beta
blockade and amiodarone started postoperatively when he was in
normal sinus rhythm but atrial fibrillation returned was treated
with cardizem.  He developed bradycardia and all av nodal
blocking agents were discontinued, coumadin started and
electrophysiology consult.  Plan to hold av nodal blocking
agents and monitor rhythm that is atrial fibrillation 50-60 and
follow up with cardiologist as outpatient.  Antihypertensives
were titrated for blood pressure management.  His foley catheter
was removed twice with failure to void and urinary retention,
remains in place at discharge and plan to follow up with
outpatient urologist.  He was ready for discharge to rehab on
post op day 8.
