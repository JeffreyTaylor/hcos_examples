History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78yo F well-known to East Surgery service from prolonged
hospitalization 2008-07-20 00:00:00/10.  She had initially presented with a
colonic perforation due to erosion from a L hip prosthesis, and
underwent a Hartmann's procedure (sigmoid colectomy with end
colostomy).  She then required an emergent R-->L Fem-Fem bypass
for acute LLE ischemia.  The hip was treated with sequential
washouts and hardware removal.  Her post-operative course was
extensive, but notable for GI bleeding presenting as falling
anemia, for which an EGD showed mild esophagitis managed with
UPMCE
protonix. A colonoscopy through the stoma was unsuccessful
because the stoma had sloughed and retracted below the skin
level.  She also developed CHF and hypothyroidism managed with
diuretics and synthroid, respectively.  Wound issues included
minor wound infection at the midline incision managed with
wet-to-dry, a VAC at the L hip changed serially in the OR and
later at the bedside, and mild breakdown at the Fem-Fem bypass
site treated with betadine swabs.  She was finally discharged on
2008-07-20 00:00:00 on a prolonged course of Zosyn, Daptomycin, and
Fluconazole via a PICC.  Since discharge she has required 4u
PRBC
transfusion for anemia and guaiac positive ostomy output: 2u on
2008-07-20 00:00:00 and 2u on 2008-07-20 00:00:00 (Hct was 23).  She denies headache,
dizziness,
CP, or SOB.  She denies abdominal pains, nausea, although did
have one episode of non-bloody non-bilious emesis this morning
and one earlier episode 4d ago.  Per the rehab notes, the
heparin
SQ was discontinued in favor of coumadin, which the pt's
daughters relate was done because she was "bleeding" at the
injection site.

IMAGING:
2008-07-20 00:00:00 hip plain film on admission showed status post left hip
arthroplasty and Girdlestone procedure. Methyl methacrylate
remains in the defect produced by the removal of the left
femoral stem. Multiple clips and left pelvic embolization coils
are unchanged in appearance.

2008-07-20 00:00:00 CT pelvis on admission showed new high-density material
envelops the femur and there are locules of gas in the left
gluteal area where there is an open wound. Locules of gas are
also seen within the femur. High-density material is also seen
overlying the left iliac intraabdominally. Right lower lobe
consolidation/atelectasis raises the possibility of infection.
Interval fem-fem bypass. New pelvicaliceal prominence
bilaterally. Persistent cholelithiasis.

2008-07-20 00:00:00 CT guided hip aspiration: heterogeneous collection in
the lateral subcutaneous tissues over the left hip. The portion
of the collection just anterior/superior to the skin staples at
the lateral aspect of the hip was targeted for aspiration with
only a few cc of dark blood could be aspirated.


2008-07-20 00:00:00 CT Chest and abdomen after patient developed hypoxia
showed no acute pulmonary embolus. Small right pleural effusion
with associated compressive atelectasis. Scattered ground-glass
opacity in the bilateral lungs.  No acute intra-abdominal
abnormality.Large heterogeneous left thyroid lesion. There was
also question of tracheobronchomalacia although formal diagnosis
would require dedicated CT chest with tracheal protocol.

2008-07-20 00:00:00 Lower extremity ultrasound to evaluate for leg edema and
to rule out DVT was markedly limited duplex examination of the
left lower extremity secondary to patient body habitus
difficulty with patient positioning.  Apparent compressibility
of the common femoral vein, proximal superficial femoral vein
and popliteal vein without convincing color Doppler flow
identified. While this may be secondary to slow flow, a deep
venous thrombosis cannot be excluded. Repeat exam demonstrated
flow in all of the deep veins.

2008-07-20 00:00:00 TT Echo showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, c/w LAD disease. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

2008-07-20 00:00:00 CTA pelvis after patient became acute anemic to evaluate
for bleed: show Fem-fem bypass graft patent, with a
pseudoaneurysm of the left external iliac, but similar to prior
study. There was chronic thrombosis of the portions of the left
external iliac artery which are stable. No evidence of new acute
hemorrhage or active extravasation. Stable appearance of left
hip with destruction of left proximal femur with gas seen within
the medullary cavity of the proximal femur. The residual hip
prosthesis is similar in appearance to prior study, with an
approximately 8.7 cm x 4.8 cm x 20 cm focus of air and debris
within the left gluteal soft tissues. Thickening of the left
iliacus relative to the right. Severe stenosis of the SMA. Small
bilateral pleural effusions associated with basal atelectasis.
Cholelithiasis, with gallbladder mildly distended though without
evidence of wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.

2008-07-20 00:00:00: CT of pelvic and L thigh after patient's WBC continued
to trend upward for show left pelvic gluteal collection now
contains predominantly air with air extending medial to the left
iliac Elliekate Zoretic. Persistent osseous destruction of the left femur
with multiple pockets of fluid and inflammatory reaction
involving the left pelvis and left femur are
once again noted. An area of mixed density over the left femur
and medial to iliac bone may represent soft tissue/ versus
collection of thick viscus fluid such as pus. Thickening and
inflammatory changes of the left iliacus muscle and left pelvic
sidewall is slightly improved since 2008-07-20 00:00:00.

2008-07-20 00:00:00: CXR 1 day after patient decompensated due to possible
aspiration pneumonia showed a diffuse area of increased
opacification in the right lung, consistent with aspiration
pneumonia. A developing area in the left lower lung zone could
well be the same etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed: The patient's increased bleeding from her ostomy was
in the setting of supratheraputic INR of 4.5.  The patient
underwent colonoscopy through her ostomy which did not show
evidence of bleeding but only revealed diverticulosis.  She did
not require any blood transfusions for her GI bleed and her Hct
remained stable in the 30s.   She was continued on protonix UPMCE.
On 2008-07-20 00:00:00, after patient was noted to aspirated, maroon colored
bloody ostomy output was noted. She was transfused 2 units of
PRBC at that time.

Hip infection: The patient had a long and complicated hospital
course in 2008-07-20 00:00:00 from a colonic perforation secondary to erosion of
her L hip prosthesis.  She developed VRE infection of the hip
and underwent multiple surgical take backs for washout and the
femoral portion of the hardware was removed, but the acetabular
portion retained. A wound vac was eventually placed and she was
discharged on Daptomycin, Fluconazole and Zosyn for a prolonged
outpatient course.  Upon admission, she was noted to have a rash
and her zosyn was changed to meropenem.  A CT scan showed fluid
around the femur which was tapped on 2008-07-20 00:00:00 and grew 2 strains of
ESBL E coli and vanc sensitive enterococcus. Ortho planned to
take the patient to the operating room on 2008-07-20 00:00:00, however this was
delayed by tachypnea from pneumonia and CHF (see below).  On
2008-07-20 00:00:00 the patient went to the OR for hip washout and wound vac
placement.  After the procedure she developed increased bleeding
from the wound and went back to the OR for exploration of the
hip. No active bleeding was noted.  She was transfused 5 units
of RBCs with inappropriate bump in Hct.  She underwent CTA of
her arteries to rule out arterial leak and there was none, but
there was pseudoanuerysm of the external iliac that was stable
from prior study. Vascular surgery thought no intervention was
needed.  All anticoagulation was held. Pt went to the OR for
subsequent washouts and removal of all hardware on 2008-07-20 00:00:00,
2008-07-20 00:00:00. The blood cultures on 2008-07-20 00:00:00 grew ESBL klebsiella. Pt was
treated with meropenem, fluconazole, daptomycin for an 8 week
course. Pt transfered to the surgical floor on 2008-07-20 00:00:00. Although
patient was stable on the floor and was seen regularly by PT for
future rehap, her WBC continue to elevated. Her initial left
shift resolved but WBC persisted. CT scan of her pelvis  showed
destruction of her L femur and air pockets in L hip/thigh. Per
orthopedic surgery service, she was planned to undergo CT guided
drain placement along her left femur on 2008-07-20 00:00:00. However,
patient's condition decompensate quickly on 2008-07-20 00:00:00 after she
noticed to have aspirated her feed.

Pneumonia: On 2008-07-20 00:00:00 the patient was transfered to the ICU for
monitoring of tachypnea and diuresis for presumptive CHF
exacerbation.  She promptly developed a fever to 102.  A CTA was
performed to rule out PE and was negative for PE, but revealed
ground glass opacities consistent with pneumonia.  Ciprofloxacin
was added to her antibiotics for double coverage of pseudomonas,
but this was stopped the following day.  She was intubated to go
to the OR for hip I and D. She recoved well and was extubated
with eventual transfer to regular surgical floor.

CHF/ : On 2008-07-20 00:00:00 the patient became tachypneic in the setting of
having received IV fluids.  She also had an elevated troponin to
0.13.  A BNP was elevated and it was thought that the patient
was in heart failure.  Cardiology was consulted for pre-op risk
assessment and recommended that her volume status be optimized
prior to surgery.  She was diuresed with lasix 10 mg IV with
good urine output and improvement of symptoms.  She underwent
echocardiogram which showed a hypo- to akinetic apex (mid-LAD
territory) with EF 35%.  It was unclear if an ACS 123 Any St.itated
the new heart failure as there were no signs of ischemia on ECG,
yet the troponin was trending down.  Cardiology was consulted.
The patient was started on coreg, simvastatin, but was not
started on aspirin given her bleeding risk.  She should be
started on an ACEi if her BP tolerates it. Pt had a few episodes
of hypotension which responded to fluid boluses. Carvedilol was
resumed on 2008-07-20 00:00:00.

# Poor PO intake: The patient had G tube placed 2008-07-20 00:00:00 for poor
PO intake and hypoalbuminemia.
.
# Drug rash: Eos were found in urine. Zosyn was thought to be
the culprit. So this was stopped and the patient was changed to
meropenem.  Her rash resolved.
.
# Possible aspiration, shortness of breath/tachycardia: The
patient became acutely short of breath and tachycardic
immediately after an episode of tube-feed colored emesis on
2008-07-20 00:00:00. Her shortness of breath and hypoxemia did not improve
after a nebulizer treatment and supplemental O2.  She was
subsequently transferred to the ICU the evening of this episode
for close monitoring. Her dyspnea progressed and she was
intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure. Her CXR on the
following day showed opacity consistent with aspiration
pneumonia. She became hypotensive, placed  on two pressors.
Patient's condition deteriorated quickly and comfort measure
only was initiated by her family. She passed away at 1:45pm on
2008-07-20 00:00:00.
