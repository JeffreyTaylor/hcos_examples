CT guided pigtail placement left pleural space
2009-07-08 00:00:00
CT guided drain placed in peris123 Any St. fluid collection


History of Present Illness:
41-year-old black gentleman status post Nissen
fundoplication five years ago.  He did great during this time
with no reflux or difficulty swallowing at all.  He had
123 Any St.usly undergone endoscopic approaches to relieve his
heartburn, which had failed.  However, for the last two months,
he has had difficulty with some reflux as well as swallowing
water.  Endoscopy revealed a small hiatal hernia and gastritis.
A barium swallow showed a small herniation of the GE junction
possibly above the diaphragm.  He complains of these problems
with swallowing and also notes more frequent burping.


Past Medical History:
Episcleritis bilaterally: Followed by Dr. Lascelles Nedwick.
GERD s/p Nissen Fundoplication
Obesity
Hypercholesterolemia: Borderline in the past.
Chronically elevated liver function tests: Normal evaluation in
the past.
Chronic low back pain
Hypertension.
s/p distal biceps tear and repair on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 by Dr. Cifuentes.

Social History:
The patient states that he drinks beer occasionally on the
weekends. He smokes occasional cigars, but is exposed to
secondhand smoke at home. The patient smoked while he was in
military but quit over 10 years ago.


Family History:
Mother has a history of migraine headaches. His mother has a
history of diabetes. Uncle has a history of lung cancer. He has
four children who are all healthy.


Physical Exam:
Vital signs

Temperature of 97.2, blood pressure 143/92, O2 sat 99%, pulse
84, Resp 20, weight 236 pounds.
Breathing comfortably.
Abdomen is soft.  Incision is well healed.
Moving all extremities well.


Pertinent Results:
2009-07-08 00:00:00  UGI : No evidence of leak. Slow passage of contrast
from the esophagus into the stomach, likely from edema, with
residual barium within the distal esophagus.

2009-07-08 00:00:00 CT Abd/pelvis/CTA chest :
1. Dense right lower lobe consolidation consistent with
pneumonia. Large
left pleural effusion with pleural enhancement; infection cannot
be excluded.  Small right effusion. Patchy consolidation at lung
apices suggests aspiration or infection.
2. Fluid collection in the surgical bed, extending along the
stomach and
pancreatic tail, with marked stranding in left upper quadrant.
Extraluminal hyperdense material at the GE junction may
represent surgical pledgets or extravasated contrast. Cannot
exclude anastomotic leak. Notably, however, there is no
intraperitoneal free air (endoscopy with insufflation was
performed prior to this examination to assess for leak).
3. Limited evaluation for pulmonary embolus due to timing of
contrast, but no evidence of large pulmonary embolus.
4. Peripancreatic fluid may be tracking from surgical bed, but
recommend
obtaining pancreatic enzymes for clinical correlation to exclude
pancreatitis as a cause of left upper quadrant inflammatory
change.
5. ETT terminates 1.4 cm above the carina. Consider
repositioning.
2009-07-08 00:00:00 TTE :
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic
function. Right ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, mild
hypokinesis, and severe estimated pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. These findings are consistent with a primary
chronic pulmonary process.

2009-07-08 00:00:00 Esophagus :
 No evidence of leak at the gastric fundus to correlate with the
findings on 123 Any St.us CT. While it remains possible that the
density at the GE junction seen on the 123 Any St.us CT represents
leaked barium, given the inability to demonstrate leak on the
present examination, these densities are felt more likely to
represent hyperdense pledgets which were reportedly used in the
surgery.

2009-07-08 00:00:00 CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Stable size and configuration of
peri-GE junction low-density fluid. No new intraabdominal
collection. Unchanged extraluminal hyperdense material, may
represent extraluminal contrast versus surgical pledgets.
2. New small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the mid
abdomen (2, 66), most likely due to adhesion.
3. Improved bilateral pleural effusions status post left chest
tube
placement. Improved but persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Trace pneumomediastinum, likely expected post-surgical
change.

2009-07-08 00:00:00 CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Interval placement of multiple
intra-abdominal drains, with persistent multiple low-density
collections within the lesser sac and peripancreatic location,
gastrohepatic space, and peris123 Any St. regions. Though one of the
drains situated in the gastrohepatic space appears centered
within a fluid collection, the remainder of the drains do not.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion, larger in size, that is
slightly
hyperattenuating, may contain hemorrhagic or proteinacious
components.
3. Left subclavian line tip not central in location and should
be adjusted.
4. Trace free fluid in the pelvis, nonspecific, and may reflect
sequela of
recent surgery.

2009-07-08 00:00:00 CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Interval decrease in size of
peris123 Any St. fluid collection which contains a pigtail catheter;
decreased although persistent smaller loculations including
lesser sac, peripancreatic and gastrohepatic collection.
2. Near-resolution of a left pleural effusion which contains a
pigtail
catheter.
3. Stranding and low density within the abdominal wall
musculature,
developing collection not entirely excluded. Correlation with
physical
examination and consideration of ultrasound is suggested if an
infection is suspected in the area. The CT findings are
non-specific and may be
post-operative or due to serous or infected fluid.
4. Few subtle wedge-shaped hypodensities within the renal
parenchyma. main
differential considerations include infarction versus infection,
other
etiologies are considered less likely. Correlation with
urinalysis and other clinical factors is suggested. The areas of
relative hypoperfusion are in the upper poles only, so possibly
the appearance is secondary to nearby peripancreatic
inflammation and might not be significant in itself.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Cifuentes presented to UPMCE on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 for a laparoscopic Redo
Nissen which was converted to open Nissen redo and hiatal hernia
repair. Postoperatively, he was transferred from the PACU to the
floor where over the next few days experienced an increase in
oxygen requirements with saturations in the 90s% despite
vigorous pulmonary toilet. His chest xray revealed a new large
left pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion.  This
prompted an upper GI which ruled out a leak. His pain was
controlled with an epidural and PCA and his stomach remained
decompressed with a nasogastric tube.

On 2009-07-08 00:00:00 he was transferred to the SICU as he had more
respiratory distress and was electively intubated for airway
control and subsequent imaging. He had a CT scan of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis. This imaging study showed a large left
pleural effusion and RLL consolidation c/w pneumonia, peri-GE
junction fluid. His WBC 25K at that time and vancomycin was
started. The thoracic surgery service was consulted for left
chest tube placement and subsequent endoscopy which revealed
normal mucosa, an intact wrap and no leaks. His chest tube
drained about 850 cc and his PO2 gradually improved. His sputum
culture was MSSA positive, BAL were both negative.  He also
developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was seen by the
Cardiology service. Part of their work up included an ECHO which
showed moderate-severe RV dysfunction demonstrated by PASP 62.
His EF was 60%.  his atrial fibrillation converted to NSR with
amiodarone.

On 2009-07-08 00:00:00, he was trialed for extubation, but reintubated for
increased work of breathing.

On 2009-07-08 00:00:00 he had a follow up CT scan which showed fluid at GE
junction. Due to an increasing WBC and no significant
improvement he had an exploratory lap and washout of
intraperitoneal hematoma which showed no evidence of leak. He
was started Zosyn and continued on vancomycin empirically. His
left chest tube was removed without difficulty.

From 2009-07-08 00:00:00, Mr. Cifuentes continued to be intubated with a mucus
plug removed by bronchoscopy on 2009-07-08 00:00:00, and a failed trial of
extubation on 2009-07-08 00:00:00. He had a follow up CT torso on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 which a
large L pleural effusion and subdiaphragmatic/peris123 Any St.
collection. Both the left pleural effusion and peris123 Any St.
abscess were drained by IR on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 with pig tail catheters.
These collections both drained dark fluid which were culture
negative. Mr. Cifuentes WBC count began trending down from 17 to 12
following drainage.

Additionally, after the IR guided drainage of the left pleural
effusion and peris123 Any St. fluid, Mr. Cifuentes respiratory status
improved and he was extubated on 2009-07-08 00:00:00. After extubation, he
improved rapidly and on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 his tube feeds, nasogastric tube,
foley, and central venous line were all discontinued and his
diet was advanced to full liquids. He was transferred to the
floor on 2009-07-08 00:00:00.

On the floor, Mr. Cifuentes continued to improve dramatically while
his WBC decreased to 10.3.  He was seen by physical therapy for
deconditioning but after a few treatments he was up and walking
independently.  A followup CT scan on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 showed that the
left pleural effusion had mostly resolved and the peris123 Any St.
collection had decreased to 13 mm. His drains were then
sequentially discontinued. On 2009-07-08 00:00:00 the last drain was removed,
his WBC was 6K and his antibiotics were discontinued.

His abdominal wound drained some serosanguinous fluid from the
lower 1/3rd and was partially opened on 2009-07-08 00:00:00.  There was no
cellulitis and the base of the wound was clean.  He underwent
UPMCE dressing changes with saline moist to dry gauze. He did have
some minor skin tears which were treated with non adherent
dressings. His a123 Any St.e was slowly improving and he was also
started on Ensure for supplementation.

After a long, protracted hospital course he was discharged to
home on 2009-07-08 00:00:00 and will follow up with Dr. Lascelles Nedwick in 2 weeks.
