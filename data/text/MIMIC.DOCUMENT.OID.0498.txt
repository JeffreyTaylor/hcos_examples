Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 y.o male with a history of MDS, HTN, gout, CVA,
afib, CHF, colon cancer s/p colectomy with ostomy who initially
presented to 123 Any St. with weakness and chills.  There, he was
found to have an elevated WBC from baseline, decreased platelet
counts and positive UA.
.
In the emergency department his initial vitals were VS at test@mail.com00/63 18 98%.  Here he was noted to have guaiac
positive, brown stool from ostomy, blood near stoma.  During his
stay in the ED, his SBP was running in 90's.  He received a
total of 2L IVF.  He was found to have questionable ischemic vs.
emboli to the finger.  Vascular surgery was consulted who
believed this to be consistent with bruising, no concern for
ischemia.  EKG shows STD laterally, trop .05, he did not receive
an aspirin.  CXR unremarkable.  The patient had 3 PIVs placed.
He was given ceftaz and linezolid empirically as well as stress
dose steroids.
.
On arrival to the UPMCE, the patient stated that his only concern
was left shoulder pain for a few days-inside the joint, some
radiation, no paresthesias or weakness. Pt's aid reported
increased diarrhea and output from the stoma that "smells like
C.diff" with some blood. Pt's aid reported that he was on
amoxicillin last week for dental procedure.
.
Overnight in the UPMCE, the patient was monitored closely.
Antibiotic coverage was changed to cipro and flagyl to cover for
suspected GU source of infection and C diff.  Blood and urine
cultures were sent, including C diff toxin.  He was not
transfused blood or platelets, because he has been trending down
over the past month.  The patient's PCP, Hegel. Hegel came to see
the patient today and discussed the overall plan is for him to
go home with hospice.  Currently, the patient complains of not
being able to eat the things he likes because of diet
restrictions, but has no other complaints.  Denies

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a pleasant 83 y.o male with a history of HTN, advanced
MDS, a fib, CVA, colon cancer s/p ostomy admitted to the UPMCE
for hypotension in the setting of infection, likely GU and GI
sources.
.
#.  Hypotension/SIRS - secondary to C diff colitis:  On
presentation the patient had significant leukocytosis (upwards
of 40 at 123 Any St.), hypotension, hypothermia, and elevated
lactate.  The most likely source of his infection was GI, given
increased stool output from ostomy per 24 hour caregivers with
recent antibiotic use for dental procedure.  The patient's
hypotension and elevated lactate resolved and leukocytosis
improved after 2L IV NS in ED and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Given one dose of high dose steroids in ED, unlikely to be
adrenal insufficency, treated with home dose of prednisone. C.
diff toxin was positive, and patient was treated with PO Flagyl.
 He was continued on flagyl for 7 days while inpatient and
continued for an additional 7 days.  The patient did not have
evidence of any other source of infection during his hospital
stay.
.
#.  Advanced MDS:  Anemia and Thrombocytopenia - Seemed to be
progressing over the past month per his primary care physician
and primary oncologist.  Likely the patient's bruising/blood
blisters on his fingers were related to his decreased platelet
count. During his hospital stay, the patient received a total of
3 units of PRBCs and one of platelets.  Platelets were
transfused given increased bleeding from ostomy, likely related
to colitis.  Palliative care was consulted, however the patient
and family do not want to 'stop treatment' at this point.  They
want the primary goal to be comfort, but want to continue
transfusions and pro-crit because they believe he these
therapies help his symptoms.  Likely end stage disease, but
family would like to change oncology care to UPMCE.  Will follow
up with Dr. Hegel in one month.
.
#. Non-gap metabolic acidosis:  Secondary to increased amounts
of output from ostomy.  Improved when ostomy output decreased,
and when given adequate IV fluids.
.
#. Acute renal failure:  Secondary to dehydration given prerenal
picture.  Baseline crn 0.6-0.8, highest 1.3, 0.9 on discharge.
Improved with hydration
.
#. T wave inversions:  Present in V2-v5 on admission, likely
related to demand ischemia in the setting of infection and
anemia.  Trop 0.05 then 0.03, 0.03 in the setting of acute renal
failure.  EKG changes recurred with worsening anemia, was
transfused.
.
#. A fib:  Remained rate controlled continued toprol XL, briefly
held.  Determined to discontinue coumadin given
thrombocytopenia.  The patient and family were aware of the risk
of bleeding outweighing risk of stroke.  Also discussed with
primary cardiologist, Dr. Hegel, who agreed.
.
#. Hypertension:  Was hypotensive on admission, intially held
lasix and toprol.  Restarted toprol during stay and asked to
restart lasix on discharge given scrotal, penile and leg edema
following multiple transfusions.
.
#. Gout:  Continued allopurinol, colchicine, prednisone and
vicodin PRN.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia:  Decided to discontinue lipitor given goals
of care.
.
#. Glaucoma:  Continued eye drops
.
CODE STATUS:  DNR/DNI - not hospice at this point, but moving in
that direction, see above discussion
