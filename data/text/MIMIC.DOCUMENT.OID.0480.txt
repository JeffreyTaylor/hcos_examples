History of Present Illness:
49M with HBV, HCV and ESRD 2012-05-19 00:00:00 HIV on dialysis for 25 years
presents with purulent drainage from around the peritoneal
dialysis catheter with an exposed cuff.  He dialyzes himself at
home and follows up at UPMCE Clinic sporadically.  He presented
to UPMCE Clinic today and was sent to UPMCE ED for the exposed
catheter cuff and exit site infection.  The peritoneal dialysis
catheter is working and he reports clear output.

The patient denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea. He does not recall last bowel movement. He
reports decreased a123 Any St.e and weight loss but unsure how much.
He was dialyzed last night.

The patient is a very poor historian.  There is a note in his
paperwork from Alison that he was admitted to UPMCE from 2012-05-19 00:00:00
to 2012-05-19 00:00:00 but it does not state why.  The patient reports that
it was for infection of his peritoneal dialysis catheter and he
was treated with antiobiotics.

On initial evaluation in the ED, the patient was reportedly very
somnolent and unresponsive to sternal rub but then aroused
without intervention and was able to answer questions.  CD4
count was 273 2 years ago and the patient is reportedly
non-compliant with his medications.

Past Medical History:
* HIV
- diagnosed HIV+ in 2012-05-19 00:00:00 while he was in Guantanamo Bay.  He
received political asylum.  He feels his HIV infection was the
result of receipt of blood transfusions as a result of injuries
sustained while being interrogated in a jail in 123 Any St.. He
sustained several gunshot
wounds and lacerations, as well as blunt trauma. He reported
having CMV retinitis of the R eye that was diagnosed in 2012-05-19 00:00:00. It
was treated with a ganciclovir implant, but was further
complicated by chronic pain that resulted in enucleation.  He
also had a work up for a pulmonary nodule in 2012-05-19 00:00:00, that
ultimately was felt to be consistent with latent TB infection,
and he was treated with 6 months of INH therapy in one report,
up to a year in another.  He also had pneumococcal sepsis in
2012-05-19 00:00:00."

IMAGING
-------
Chest X-ray on admission: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar hazy
opacity which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but
infection also is in the differential. Small bilateral pleural
effusions. Limited evaluation of the right lung apex.
.
CT head on admission:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Near-complete opacification of the bilateral mastoid air
cells, unchanged on the left, but new on the right.
3. Increased size and number of lucencies within the calvaria
should be
correlated clinically with any history of malignancy, and a bone
scan can be obtained for further evaluation. This finding was
communicated to Dr. Zaid Dugan Dr. Alison at 12:20 a.m. via
telephone on 2012-05-19 00:00:00.
4. Extensive paranasal sinus disease, as described above.
5. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease, not
significantly changed compared to 2012-05-19 00:00:00.
.
CXR 2012-05-19 00:00:00:
As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, there is increased
parenchymal opacity in the right perihilar lung areas. Although
unilateral pulmonary edema would be more likely than pneumonia,
pneumonia cannot be excluded on grounds of the radiologic
appearance.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged
vascular stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old Haitian male with poorly controlled HIV (last CD4
count 273 in 2012-05-19 00:00:00, in-house level 52), HBV coinfection and a
history of longstanding peritoneal dialysis who presented 2012-05-19 00:00:00
with mental status change, hypotension, and hypothermia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Pneumonia: community acquired pneumonia vs. PCP pneumonia,
patient is on prophylactic Bactrim at home.  He presented with
hypothermia and altered mental status.  CD4 count was noted to
be 52.  Patient was initially on vancomycin/zosyn for empiric
coverage, then switched to PO moxifloxacin for planned five day
course after blood cultures remained negative.   Chest X-ray
showed perihilar opacity.  Patient will continue bactrim
prophylaxis upon discharge.  Sputum cultures were obtained but
were contaminated.  Infectious disease was consulted and
recommended the above antibiotic therapy, as well as continuing
prophylactic Bactrim.
.
# HIV: CD4 count measured at 52 during admission, viral load 88
copies.  Patient was continued on his home HAART regimen, as
well as prophylactic Bactrim.  Patient will likely require
re-evaluation of his HAART regimen upon discharge.
.
# Pancytopenia: patient was noted to be pancytopenic during his
hospital stay, and it is unclear if this is chronic.  This may
be related to his HIV, or other etiology, however this was not
worked up further due to patient's insistence to be transferred
to UPMCE Hospital.
.
# Bradycardia: on 2012-05-19 00:00:00 patient had a pause on telemetry (8
seconds) with transient hypotension to the 80s and hypoxia to
the 80s which recovered within seconds.  Later in the evening he
had two episodes of bradycardia to the high 20s which was
self-limited within seconds and asymptomatic.  Electrolytes,
cardiac enzymes and EKG were within normal limits; a cardiology
consult was obtained and no further evaluation or intervention
was recommended.
.
# Head imaging abnormality: patient was noted to have lucencies
in the calvarium on head CT.  This was not worked up further due
to patient's insistence to be transferred to UPMCE Hospital.
.
# End-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis: patient
presented with concern for peritoneal dialysis port site
infection, with purulent fluid coming from the site.  Cultures
were obtained via diagnostic paracentesis and were 123 Any St.inarily
negative upon discharge.  Patient is on Calcitriol 0.5 and
sinacalcet 150 mg daily.  Renal was consulted for performance of
peritoneal dialysis while patient was hospitalized.  CBC should
be trended for further signs of infection.
.
# Anemia: likely combination of bone marrow suppression as well
as chronic kidney disease.  The patient recieved one unit RBCs
for Hct 22.9 with an appropriate bump to 26.9.  Epoeitin was
held given concern for possible malignancy on head CT.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
---------------
# Hypertension: patient is on lisinopril and amolodipine at
home.  His home blood pressure medications were resumed after
they were initially held due to his presenting sepsis-like
picture.
.
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------
# Follow-up: patient will be discharged to UPMCE Hospital per
his request.  Patient will require antibiotics to finish course
of antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia.  Blood cultures
and peritoneal cultures are currently pending and will need to
be followed up.  There was also concern for malignancy of CT
head that will need to be followed up.  This was not addressed
during the UPMCE hospital stay given his refusal for further
work-up.  He should receive CBC and Chem10 every day for
monitoring.  Epoietin is being held at the current time due to
the concern for malignancy on CT head.  This should be
re-evaluated in the near future.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Alison,

It was a pleasure caring for you at the UPMCE.  You came for further evaluation of altered
mental status and hypothermia.  Further testing showed that you
had a pneumonia, for which you are being treated with
antibiotics.  There was also concern for infection of your
peritoneal dialysis insertion site.  Cultures were obtained from
this area, and revealed no evidence of infection.  You are now
being discharged to UPMCE Hospital for further treatment.
Dr. Frenchie at UPMCE Hospital was contactFrenchie Alison and accepted the
patient for transfer.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

We STARTED Bactrim
We STARTED moxifloxacin, which should be taken for five days
total
We STOPPED Epoeitin for the time being, which should be further
re-evaluated in the future

Followup Instructions:
Please call Dr. Zaid Dugan office at test@mail.com to
schedule a follow-up appointment in ~2 weeks after discharge.
