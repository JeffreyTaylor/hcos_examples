one-week history of melena and chest pain.
.
The patient underwent a Colonoscopy and EGD on 2008-10-03 00:00:00 after he
was found to be guaiac positive by his PCP in early 2008-10-03 00:00:00.
Colonoscopy showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
proximal ascending colon. EGD revealed a polyp in the pylorus
and a polyp in the second part of the duodenum, both of which
were biopsied. The procedure was uncomplicated and the patient
was discharged home. Two days later he developed black, tarry
stools, approximately two episodes per day for five days. Over
this time he also developed 2008-10-03 00:00:00 substernal chest pressure
associated with climbing stairs and walking on an incline, and
relieved with rest. The pain was non-radiating and associated
with SOB and dizziness, but not N/V, diaphoresis or
palpitations. He went to church on the day prior to admission
and was walking with a friend who is a nurse who told him that
he looked pale and that he should see a doctor. He had an
additional episode of chest pain and melena and decided to
present to the ED.

In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable with BP 129/60
and HR 80. His cardiac enzymes were positive and he was given an
ASA and the plan was admission to UPMCE. His hct returned at 23.6
(down from 44 in 2008-10-03 00:00:00) and he had guaiac positive stool. He
was admitted to the MICU for observation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:
.
# GIB: Pt presented with melena which was thought most likely
due to an upper GI bleed as a complication of his polypectomy
seven days prior to admission.  Because of his dramatic drop in
hematocrit, he was admitted to the MICU for observation.  In the
MICU he remained hemodynamically stable and was transfused a
total of 5 U PRBC's with his hematocrit correcting to 31-32.  He
underwent emergent EGD on 2008-10-03 00:00:00 which showed an ulcer located
at the pylorus.  The edges of the ulcer were cauterized, the pt
tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.  He
returned to the MICU where he was again stable and his Hcts x
24h remained 31-32.  He was transferred to the medicine floor
the morning of 2008-10-03 00:00:00.  His hcts did not change while on the
floor and he was discharged home with plans to f/u with GI in
2008-10-03 00:00:00 days to monitor his hct and a proton-pump inhibitor 4-mg UPMCE
x 14 days and then qd thereafter.
.
# Demand ischemia/CAD.  Pt was admitted with CP on mild exertion
in the setting of his GIB.  On admission he had elevated cardiac
enzymes (weakly positive CKMB and troponin) and no concerning
EKG changes.  He was admitted with the plan to folow his
enxzymes.  His ASA was held.  He was seen by the cardiology
service who took him off his CCB, started beta blockade,
recommended transfusion to goal Hct 30-35 and continuation of
his statin.  His CK/CKMB were never positive after the first day
of admission.  His Tpn trended up to 0.10 and then to 0.14 on
2008-10-03 00:00:00.  However, he remained hemodynamically stable,
symptom-free, and was able to walk around the floor extensively
without symptoms.  He is instructed to call Dr.Jayan Kamphaus office in
the cardiology clinic to arrange follow-up and schedule and
outpatient stress test.
.
#. FEN.  His electrolytes were within normal limits throughout
his stay.  He was started on a clear liquid diet on 2008-10-03 00:00:00.  On
2008-10-03 00:00:00 he was able to tolerate soft solids and his diet was
advanced to a regular heart healthy diet.  On the day of
discharge he was able to take normal po's and was hydrating
himself adequately.
.
#. Code status: FULL CODE.
.
#. Dispo.  The pt is discharged to home in good condition.  He
will start a new medication regimen that includes PPI,
betablocker and statin.  He will need a capusle endoscopy and
will f/u with Dr. Jayan in the GI department.  He has a scheduled
follow-up [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 5692**] Kamphaus Dr. Beyan Shahwan in the cardiology department
