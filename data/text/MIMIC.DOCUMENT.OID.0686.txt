Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Jouette Auwarter
Chief Complaint:
large intraparenchymal bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 90 yo woman with PMH of dementia, obesity, OA, DM2,
HTN, cataracts, falls, CRF, Anemia, DNR/DNI and active UTI who
suffered a fall at UPMCE Rehab today.  She is primarily Russian
speaking, but also speaks some English.  She was heard to fall
in the bathroom at 0800.  Patient denied LOC and was without any
apparent injury.  She was put back in  bed.  some time
thereafter she was noted to have dysarhtira, left facial droop
and flaccid left hemiparesis in the left arm.  She was
transfered to UPMCE for presumed CVA.

She reports to me that she fell and endorses pain in her head
and her lower back.  She endorses that she fell around the time
of the pain, but she cannot communicate the exact sequence of
events.

At baseline she is demented but very active, walking with walker
and conversant.  She has recently been getting treatment for UTI
with Levaquin.  Her proxy Canden Rabin reports that her family noticed
some mild speech impairments last week, but no focal weakness.
This however was around the time of the positive UA and may have
been related to infection.

ROS: she is unable to offer full ROS.  She is known to have
acitve UTI and she does endorse headache and LBP.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: On arrival was reportedly only responsive to
heavy sternal rub.  She is now awake, speaking a few words
coherently, but mostly incoherent.  She is following many
commands.  She regards the right side of the room better than
the left, but does regard her left arm.  She is oriented to self
and says UPMCE.  She cannot name the day,date or year.  She does
not sound dysarthric but mumbles.  It is difficult as she has a
hard collar on, and speaks Russian as her primary language.
Difficult to assess attention, but seems to be mildly
inattentive at least.  Cannot name watch.  Repeats.  Confuses
right with left but does not neglect left arm.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and trace reactive to light,3 mm
bilaterally and surgical. Blinks to threat right, but not left.
Does not track.  Appears to have right gaze preference.  Crosses
past midline to left only slightly.  Face symmetric at rest,
does not smile though.  Hearing intact grossly.  Does not
cooperate with testing tongut, SCM, Palate, Trap.

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone normal right but flaccid left arm.
No observed myoclonus or tremor She cannot cooperate with formal
strength testing, but is
definitely full strength in the right tricep and finger flexors.
 Her left arm is briefly anti-gravity and withdraws weakly to
pain, and appears significantly weaker than the right.  She has
very brief antigravity strength of the IPs bilaterally and
appears to withdraw relatively equally in the lower extremities.


Sensation: Grimaces x 4, but less so in LUE. Withdraws x 4.

Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric throughout. Crossed adductors.
Toes down right and up left.

Coordination: could not assess.
Gait: could not assess.

HCT:
Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the right
parietal lobe with small amount of blood in the subjacent
subdural and subarachnoid space. Differential include amyloid
angiopathy, underlying neoplasm and less likely vascular
malformation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Rabin was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. Her
hospital course by problem is as follows:

1) ICH: felt to be likely secondary to head trauma after her
fall. She was maintained with a SBP goal 130-170 and MAP < 130.
She was treated with lopressor 25 PO BID with holding
parameters. Dilantin was initially given and then held to avoid
confusion regarding her sedation. An EEG was ordered which
showed generalized slowing without epileptiform discharges. Her
secondary stroke risk factors where checked and were as follows:
HbA1c: 6.3, HDL: 34, LDL: 63. Over the course of her first
night, she became increasingly sedated and vomited. A stat head
CT was done which was unchanged but she was started on mannitol
to reduce intracerebral edema. Her OSM and Na where monitored.
She was also maintained normothermic and normoglycemic.

2) Goal's of Care-
The patient's neurologic exam did not improve despite the above
measures. She remained minimally responsive and unable to follow
commands. Extensive discussion with health care proxy and family
around benefits of placing a feeding tube ensued. The family
decided to not place a feeding tube and make the patient for
comfort measures only in hospice level care. The family would
like to provide an additional 2-3 days of IV fluid support in
hopes that the patient will survive another 10 days. The
palliative care service and UPMCE was consulted to aide in the
family's decision making. Recommend morphine oral concentrate
for comfort. Hyocyamine 0.125-0.25mg SL q4h PRN for excess
secretions. Haldol 0.5-1mg DL q4h PRN agitation. Ativan
0.5mg-1mg q4h PRN anxiety.

3) FEN/GI: She failed a swallow evaluation and would require a
PEG for nutrition. Extensive discussion with family determined
patient would be made for comfort measures only. She may take PO
as she is able.
