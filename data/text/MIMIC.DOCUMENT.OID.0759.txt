Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Audris Baffoni
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral line placed

History of Present Illness:
75 y/o M [**First Name3 (LF) **] speaking only PMH ESRD on HD, CAD, PAF, COPD,
HTN who presensts with altered mental status of 2 days duration.
Initially felt to be secondary to percocet use at rehab, but HD
facility was concerned and sent patient to be evaluated. Per
family patient is AOx3 at baseline but has been more confused
recently. Notes slow decline over several days since being at
the rehab. States he was also given a "sleeping pill" the day
before admission. Family did not notice any increased cough,
SOB, or fever.
.
Patient was recently admitted 2009-01-05 00:00:00 for left humeral
fracture, hypoxia and inability to care for himself at home. For
left humeral fracture patient was evaluated by ortho who
recommended sling. Hypoxia was felt to be secondary to mild COPD
exacerbation and was treated with aggressive neb therapy and
oral steroids. At time of discharge his O2 sats were 90% on RA
with occasional desats to the high 80s and discharged on 1L NC
to be weaned as tolerated. Patient was discharged to rehab.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 96.9 86 107/84 22 91. Patient spiked
a temp to 100.2. rectally. CT head demonstrated no
abnormalities. CXR demonstrated right lower lobe infiltrate.
Patient was given levofloxacin and zosyn and 1L NS. A groin CVL
was placed. His LUE was noted to be swollen and echymotic but an
u/s revealed no DVT. Ortho evaluated it in the ED and
recommended continued sling and NWB. He was agitated and
confused, so received 5mg Zyprexa. Vitals on transfer were 98.8
rectal, HR 63, BP 149/52, RR 13, 100% facemask. He would
reportedly desat to upper 80s on 6L NC so he was admitted to the
MICU for further care.
.
On the floor, still mildly agitated and confused. Unable to
obtain further ROS.

2009-01-05 00:00:00 CT head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. No significant
change in
cerebral volume loss and chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Bilateral
maxillary sinus disease.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00 Humerus AP/Lat:
LEFT HUMERUS, THREE VIEWS: Evaluation is limited by patient
positioning.
Within this limitation, there is no significant change in the
comminuted left humeral neck fracture with approximately 2 cm of
foreshortening. There is nodislocation. There is no new
fracture. There is subtle soft tissue calcification noted on the
second and third images at the level of the fracture which may
represent early callous formation. No radiopaque foreign body is
identified.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00 RUE Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT. Exam is limited due to
patient-related
factors.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00 Abdomen upright:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction; incomplete assessment
for free air -upright or left lateral decubitus views are
recommended to better assess for perforation.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00 RUQ ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Innumerable cysts seen within the liver and right kidney.
2. Focally distended gallbladder at the fundus without signs of
cholecystitis. If clinically indicated, a HIDA scan could be
performed to
further assess for cholecystitis. No gallstone is identified.
3. No biliary dilatation and no ascites in the right upper
quadrant.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Evaluation is limited by patient
position.
Compared to the prior study, there is increased opacity at the
right lung base concerning for infection. An opacity in the
right upper lung is stable
compared to prior and may represent a calcified granuloma. The
heart is
enlarged and there is a small residual right pleural effusion.
The left
costophrenic angle is excluded from view. A single lead follows
a normal
course from a right-sided battery pack terminating in the
expected position
over the right ventricle. There is a left tunneled internal
jugular catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There
is no pneumothorax. Left humeral fracture better evaluated on
dedicated humeral radiographs.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00 Video Swallow:
FINDINGS: Barium passed freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without
evidence of obstruction.
There was aspiration with thin consistency.
.
2009-01-05 00:00:00 CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, the patient
has taken a
better inspiration. There is unchanged extent of the bilateral
basal areas of opacity. However, no opacity has newly occurred
in the interval. Moreover, no evidence of pulmonary edema is
seen. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged
moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, unchanged position of
central venous access line and the right-sided pacemaker.



Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
75 year old 2009-01-05 00:00:00 speaking male with hx of COPD, CAD, and
recent humerus fracture presents with altered mental status and
found to have pneumonia and GNR bacteremia on 2009-01-05 00:00:00.
.
#. His hospital course is detailed below.  On the evening of
2009-01-05 00:00:00 I was called to evaluated him for "being less
responsive and looking more blue."  He was DNR/DNI at the time.
His initial BP was normal and then we were unable to obtain a
blood pressure.  O2 sats were being obtained on his forehead as
he was satting higher on his forehead than on his digits earlier
in the day.  His initial o2 sat was 90 and then was
unobtainable. He was noted to be in agonal breathing and had
fixed non responsive pupils (minimally responsive pupils per
neuro). A code stroke was immediately called.  Fluids were
opened wide.  Labs were obtained and notable for pH
7.21 pCO2 53 pO2 74 on non rebreather, lactate of 11.4, WBC
22.4, HCT stable at 25.2, INR of 7.8, and potassium of 6.8 (this
K+ was obtained within 1 min of his death and thus no medication
had been administered).  FFP was ordered and brought down to the
CT scanner but arrived within minutes of his death.  The patient
was rushed to the CT scanner for a head CT without contrast.
While at the CT scanner he had an episode of bloody emesis.  He
died within seconds of his CT scan being completed and the scan
showed no evidence of bleed or stroke.  His family members and
his primary care physician were Eversyn Anschutz about his death and
declined autopsy.  Dr. Audris Baffoni was being updated throughout the
code stroke.  He likely did from a GI bleed in the setting of a
high INR.
.
#. Klebsiella Bacteremia: His blood cx on 2009-01-05 00:00:00 were positive
for pansensitive Klebsiella bacteremia and he was on cefepime.
Subsequent blood cultures were found to be negative from
2009-01-05 00:00:00.
.
# Pneumonia: His CXR showed RUL and RLL PNA.  He was being
treated with vancomycin and cefepime given need to cover for HAP
and he was on flagyl for possible HAP.  He had a new oxygen
requirement throughout his hospitalization and he was continued
on nebulizers.  He was never able to produce a sputum for us.
His blood cx grew Klebsiella as detailed above.
.
#. Elevated WBC: His elevated WBC was thought to be secondary to
PNA and klebsiella bacteremia. He was afebrile for several days
prior to his death. His white count trended up to 23 and then
remained stable between 17-18 until the time of his death when
his WBC was 22.4.  His stool was negative for c diff. His
abdominal exam was followed and was benign and he denied
abdominal pain.
.
# Altered Mental Status: His CT scan of his head was negative.
His AMS was likely due to bactermia and PNA. His mental status
improved after he started treatment for his PNA & bacteremia and
then again after narcotic medications & clonazepam were
discontinued.  The days prior to his death he was oriented to
himself and his location.  The only exception to this was the
evening of 2009-01-05 00:00:00 when he received a dose of pain medication
for his broken humerus and he delirius. His family member (who
speaks Eversyn Anschutz) noted to me early in the day on 2009-01-05 00:00:00 that he
was much clear compared to the evening before and knew where he
was and who he was.
.
# Anemia: His HCT was 30.5 on arrival on 2009-01-05 00:00:00. His HCT
remained stable in the 25-28 range for the several days prior to
his death and his transfusion threshold was<25. Please see
humerus fracture below. On 2009-01-05 00:00:00 ortho came to evaluate the
patient as his left arm (where he had humeus fracture) looked
larger and there was concern that he could be bleeding into it
in the setting of his elevated INR. His HCT was followed closely
and was stable.  He had no evidence of compartment syndrome on
exam. He was found to be guaiac positive on exam but was having
rare bowel movements. The late morning of his death he had
question of coffee ground emesis. This was discussed with the
attending and it was decided not to place an NG tube in the
setting of a high INR.  The patient was started on an IV PPI.
.
# Elevated INR: He was given reduced dosing of coumadin given
that he was on antibiotics. His INR became supratherapeutic on
2009-01-05 00:00:00 to 5.9.  On the morning of 2009-01-05 00:00:00 his INR was 5.1.  His
coumadin was held. In the setting of ? coffee ground emesis
(detailed below under anemia section) on 2009-01-05 00:00:00 in AM he was
given vitamin K.
.
# COPD: He was on standing nebs and advair with a clear lung
exam.
.
# ESRD: He received dialysis throughout his hospitalization.  He
had one episode of hypotension post dialysis but otherwise
tolerated it well.
.
# Humerus fracture: On 2009-01-05 00:00:00 ortho came to evaluate the
patient as his left arm (where he had humerus fracture) looked
larger and there was concern that he could be bleeding into it
in the setting of his elevated INR. His HCT was followed closely
and was stable.  He had no evidence of compartment syndrome on
exam. Pain was controlled with tylenol and lidocaine and no
narcotics were given since they were thought to contribute to
his AMS.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: He was continued on home
dronedarone and diltiazem. His coumadin was held in the setting
of his high INR.
.
# Hypertension, benign: He was continue on his home diltiazem,
lisinopril, and valsartan.
.
# Coronary artery disease:  He was continued on his home ACE,
Anschutz, and aspirin
.
# Dementia: He was continued on his home Aricept.
.
# Depression: He was continued on his home citalopram.
.
# FEN: He was on a puree diet and nectar thick liquids given
concern for aspiration and was followed by speech and swallow.
