overnight. Per ortho team, patient had also been confused on
coming out of the OR on 2013-04-20 00:00:00, but his mental status cleared
up overnight. Had initially been transferred to ICU post surgery
because of hypotension, was on pressors with subsequent
normalization of blood pressures and transferred to floor team

.
2013-04-20 00:00:00 Hip pathology-DIAGNOSIS:
Left hip femoral and acetabular components, removal:
For gross examination only.
Left hip, granulation tissue, excision (A):
Coagulative necrosis and macrophage reaction to particles,
consistent with wear debris.
Left acetabulum osteolysis, excision (B-C):
- Granulation tissue, coagulative necrosis and macrophage
reaction to particles (consistent with wear debris).
- Degenerative bone.
.
HIP 2013-04-20 00:00:00-OUR VIEWS OF THE LEFT HIP:

Left total hip arthroplasty has been removed and there is
significant
osteolysis of the acetabulum and proximal femur with proximal
migration of the
femoral shaft. Infection cannot be excluded. Hemi-osteotomy is
noted
extending from the subtrochanteric region to the lateral cortex
of the
proximal femoral diaphysis secured by four cerclage wires. There
are
overlying surgical staples, soft tissue swelling and
subcutaneous emphysema.
Prostatic seeds are noted. There is an ostomy in the right lower
quadrant.

It is noted that cultures were obtained at the time of surgery.
.
CXR 2013-04-20 00:00:00-IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumothorax after central venous catheter
placement.
2. Persistent right apical thickening, probably due to scarring,
but in the absence of a more remote comparison, this could
represent a small right apical lung cancer, which should be
evaluated with chest CT.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
CT Pelvis 2013-04-20 00:00:00-IMPRESSION:
1. Status post removal of left total hip arthroplasty, resulting
in
Girdlestone configuration, with superior position of the left
femur and
mutiple femoral cerclage wires.
2. Nondisplaced linear lucency within the proximal femoral shaft
new since the radiograph of 2013-04-20 00:00:00 -- ? osteotomy.
3. Marked acetabular protrusio configuration. The inner surface
of the left acetabulum is markedly thinned and, in areas,
effaced. Focal osteopenia also noted in lesser tuberosity.
4. Apparent large fluid collection within and around the
"joint", which may represent a post-operative seroma.A few small
locules of air noted, which could relate to recent surgery.
Please note that the presence or absence of infection cannot be
determined based on imaging. Drains present.
.
Head CT 2013-04-20 00:00:00-IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Scattered
hypodense
areas in the white matter as described above, which are likely
similar to the prior MR head study of 2013-04-20 00:00:00. If there is
continued clinical concern for abnormality, MR head can be
considered if not contraindicated.
2. Vascular calcifications in the cavernous carotid segments and
in the left distal vertebral artery, patency not assessed on the
present study.
.
2013-04-20 00:00:00 CXR-REASON FOR EXAM: Status post left hip resection with
increasing confusion. Comparison is made to prior study 2013-04-20 00:00:00
and 2013-04-20 00:00:00.
Compared to 2013-04-20 00:00:00, there is new mild cardiomegaly. Dilatation
of the
ascending aorta is more notorious than before and warrants
further evaluation with either echo or CT. Asymmetrical apical
thickening is stable greater on the right. There is mild right
apical scarring.
There is no pneumothorax. There is a small left pleural
effusion.
.
RUQ u/s 2013-04-20 00:00:00-FINDINGS: Limited four-quadrant ultrasound of the
abdomen was performed. No free fluid was identified.
.
EKG 2013-04-20 00:00:00-Sinus rhythm. Early precordial QRS transition.
Borderline prolonged/upper
limits of QTc interval. Baseline artifact in the inferior leads
makes
assessment of those leads difficult. Findings are non-specific.
Since the
123 Any St.us tracing of 2013-04-20 00:00:00 the QTc interval appears longer.
.
2013-04-20 00:00:00 CXR-REASON FOR EXAM: Delirium, status post left hip
hardware removal and fever.

Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with stable dilatation
of the
ascending aorta more conspicuous than in 2013-04-20 00:00:00 and 2013-04-20 00:00:00 .
Right greater than left apical pleural thickening is again noted
with scarring in the right apex. As mentioned in prior studies,
CT is recommended to assess the dilatation of the ascending
aorta and the right upper lobe pleuroparenchymal abnormality.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are no new
lung abnormalities.
.
cta chest 2013-04-20 00:00:00-
1. Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm,4.4 cm with dimensions as
reported
above.
2. Coronary and aortic valvular calcifications.
3. Severe emphysema.
4. Consolidative and ground-glass opacity in the superior
segments of the
left lower lobe. This is likely infectious or inflammatory in
etiology,
though malignancy cannot be excluded, and a followup chest CT in
three months is recommended. Smaller nodules as detailed above
can also be followed at that time.


.
2013-04-20 00:00:00 hip XR-
There has been removal of the hardware in the left hip since the
radiographs of 2013-04-20 00:00:00. Compared to the most recent hip
radiographs rom 2013-04-20 00:00:00, there has been no significant
change. There are again seen cerclage bands within the proximal
femur. There is a perpendicular area of lucency in the proximal
femur shaft that is stable. There has been removal of the
surgical skin staples. The proximal femur is displaced
superiorly in relation to the acetabulum. Radiation seeds are
seen projecting over the prostate.  There are mild-to-moderate
degenerative changes of the right hip.

Brief Hospital Course:
This was written by your orthopedic team prior to transfer to
medicine, patient was admitted to the ortho123 Any St. surgery
service and was taken to the operating room for above described
procedure. Please see separately dictated operative report for
details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated
the procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV
antibiotics.
.
Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
.
1. POD 0 - Patient was sent to the ICU from the PACU secondary
to hypovolemia and hypotension
2. Pancytopenia - Worse from baseline. Heme consulted, monitored
with daily CBCs, temporarily (5 days) stopped azathioprine, and
started on heparin 500units SC BID for DVT prophylaxis.
Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.
.
The patient's weight-bearing status is non weight bearing at all
times on the operative extremity with knee immobilizer on.

INTERNAL MEDICINE COURSE
Assessment/Plan: 62 yo male with history of HTN, GERD, EtOH
cirrhosis, Crohn's s/p ileostomy, COPD, depression,
pancytopenia, avascular necrosis 2013-04-20 00:00:00 chronic prednisone use s/p
L hip replacement presenting originally for planned L hip
revision, but was found unable to be revised because of advanced
osteolysis, and so is now s/p total resection arthroplasty. Pt
noted to be encephalopathic after OR, initially medicine
consulted for AMS and ARF then pt was transferred to medicine.
.
#toxic metabolic encephalopathy- Pt with h.o ETOH related
cirrhosis. Per report, no recent drinking in 2 years-PCP and
family confirmed this. After procedure, pt had confusion,
agitation, and hallucinations. Pt had been ordered for higher
doses of oxycodone,  and benedryl, ativan, and flexeril were
ordered prior to medicine transfer. Labs were unrevealing, TSH
normal, Head CT without acute finding. Likely etiology was
medication effect from benzos, narcotics, flexeril in the
setting of poor hepatic and transient poor renal clearance. Pt
also was not sleeping at night. Pt with h.o ETOH abuse but no
recent drinking per report, ETOH withdrawal/DT's could have been
a consideration, but pt was without other signs of withdrawal
including HTN, tachycardia, diaphoresis. Pt, PCP, Kaethe Fross pt's
family denied that that been had been drinking for last 2 years.
Pt also developed delerium 8 days into stay and initially
improved with lactulose, making ETOH withdrawal less likely.
Another consideration would be adrenal insufficiency but no
recent steroids, cortisol normal. Abd u/s without ascites. Pt
was placed on the Avital Merulla protocol, all narcotics and flexerill
were dc'd as well as benzos and benedryl. Pt's lactulose was
uptitrated to 60mg QID. Pt was given IV fluids in order to match
ostomy outpt from lactulose. Discussed case with patient's PCP
who reported that pt has had prior hepatic encephalopathy during
GI bleed. PCP suggested initiation of rifaximin and stopping
nadolol to improve blood flow to liver. All in all, likely toxic
encephalopathy due to medications, hepatic  causes and transient
ARF. Pt instructed  rifaximin until PCP follow up. Lactulose was
discontinued prior to discharge as pt had remained with a clear
mental status for days and had massive ostomy outpt causing
metabolic acidosis. Pt remained clear off lactulose. However,
should confusion reoccur, would start lactulose 30mL TID. Due to
severe pain, pt was restarted on oxycodone prior to discharge.
He did not have any confusion.
.
#acute renal failure-baseline Cr 0.8-1.1. Peaked at 2.2 and did
have a metabolic acidosis, initially gap, then became non-gap.
ARF improved with IVF. However, ARF transiently reoccurred with
increased lactulose dosing and massive ostomy outpt. Cr on
discharge 0.9. ACEI was restarted. See above, lactulose and IVF
stopped
.
#s/p L.hip hardware resection (h.o AVN due to prednisone-s/p
THA-now hardware resection)-No plans for OR until mid-2013-04-20 00:00:00. Pt
will need rehab prior to OR procedure and returning home. Pt
will f/u with ortho after discharge to determine final course/OR
plan. Pain was controlled with standing tylenol (2grams
maximum). In addition, pt was started on lidocaine patch. As he
still had severe pain, and did have a clear mental status, low
dose oxycodone was restarted. PT followed the patient and
recommended rehab.
.
#hypernatremia-Thought to be due to increased ostomy outpt and
poor PO intake while encephalopathic. Pt received D51/2 NS with
improvement.
.
#Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm - ascending aorta measuring
up to 4.3 cm. Root approx 3.8 cm. Arch 2.8 cm. Descending 2.6
cm. Final measurements pending. No evidence of dissection or
other acute aortic syndrome. This was discussed with
cardiothoracic surgery who recommend appt with Dr. Avital Merulla and
yearly CT scan for monitoring.
.
#incidental radiographic findings-" Consolidative and
ground-glass opacity in the superior segments of the left lower
lobe. This is likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology,
though malignancy cannot be excluded, and a followup chest CT in
three months is recommended. Smaller nodules as detailed above
can also be followed at
that time".
.
#h.o ETOH cirrhosis-h.o varices and 1 prior episode of
encephalopathy. Abdominal ultrasound without ascites. See above.
Pt was given lactulose, started on rifaximin and nadolol held.
Lactulose was discontinued prior to discharge as above.
Rifaximin was continued and nadolol was restarted at 20mg daily
given h.o varices. This may be uptitrated to 40mg daily if BP
allows. In addition, would restart lactulose for an signs of
encephalopathy/confusion
.
#metabolic acidosis-non-gap-from large ostomy output and IVF NS
re123 Any St.n. Improved. Chemistry panel should be followed after
discharge.
.
#h.o Crohns-ileostomy care. Monitored ileostomy outpt. Continued
azathioprine.
.
#COPD-nebs given prn.
.
#GERD-continued PPI
.
#pancytopenia-thought to be related to cirrhosis, portal
sequestration, acute illness, and/or medication effect from
amongst other things, azithioprine. Counts improved. Counts were
monitored and actually improved during admission. However, WBC
decreased to 2.3 and plt to 87 on day of discharge. Labs
gradually  trended down to this over weekend. Considered
possibility of HIT. However, pt with plt count of 30 earlier in
course and had been on HEP SC BID. Plt count improved up to 160
while on heparin. However, counts gradually decreased to 87 on
day of discharge. Lovenox was started on 2013-04-20 00:00:00 instead of hep SC.
In addition, as plt count trended down as did WBC. HIT score was
3 for (>50% drop, but was >day 10 of admit). Pt without any
signs of thrombosis. Pt will need to have WBC and platelet count
closely monitoring in the outpatient setting while on lovenox
and azathioprine. IF continues to decrease will need eval for
HIT and/or medication effect from azithioprine.
.
#ETOH abuse-Pt did not display signs of withdrawal (but did have
encephalopathy as above). Family/PCP report no drinking in
~2years. PT denied recent ETOH. Unlikely to be withdrawal as
delerium developed 8 days into stay.  He was placed on thiamine
and folate.
.
#HTn, benign-continued ACEI, while monitoring renal function.
(ACEI held during periods of ARF)
.
#depression-continued duloxetine, no signs of SI.
.

pancytopenia
ascending thoracic aneurysm
Crohns disease
COPD


Discharge Condition:
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or

Mental Status: Clear and coherent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were initially admitted to the orthopedic service for L.hip
hardware removal. However, you then developed confusion which is
likely due to your known liver impairment and medications for
pain. You were given medications called lactulose and rifaximin
to help with confusion. Your nadolol was stopped to allow for
better blood flow to your liver, however this was restarted at
1/2 dose (20mg daily). Your pain medications were initially
stopped and you were placed on tylenol and a lidocaine patch.
Your confusion improved on this regimen and your lactulose was
able to be stopped and low dose oxycodone able to be restarted.
In addition, you were evaluated by physical therapy who
determined that you would benefit from a short stay in a rehab
facility.
.
In addition, you were found to have an aneurysm in your thoracic
aorta. This was discussed with you. The cardiothoracic team was
made aware and have suggested that you be evaluated in clinic.
Then you will need yearly evaluations in clinic with a CT scan.
.
You were found to have a haziness on your L.lung. This is likely
due to fluid. However, radiology has recommended that you have a
repeat CT scan in 3 month's time for reevaluation. Please
discuss this with your PCP.
.
The orthopedic doctors Kaethe Fross be deciding when to replace your
hip. PLease be sure to follow up in clinic for this issue.
.
Medication changes:
1.start lactulose for recurrent confusion
2.start rifaximin for confusion-please discuss with your
PCP/gastroenterologist on when to stop
3.start tylenol 650mg Three times a day for pain
4.stop oxycontin
5.stop ativan
6.lovenox injections daily to prevent blood clots
