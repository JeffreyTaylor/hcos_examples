Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Joyceline Soignier
Chief Complaint:
78 yo F w/ abd pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right femoral line
right upper extremity PICC
transient levophed


History of Present Illness:
78 yo F w/ h/o hyperchol, IDDM, asthma, and s/p CCY several
years ago who presents from rehab w/ c/o RUQ abd pain x 3 days.
Patient d/c from UPMCE 2009-04-24 00:00:00 following a right transmetatarsal
amputation for gangrenous right foot. Patient's admission was
uncomplicated other than a fever spike on POD #1 o/n but CXR
negative and patient defervesced. She required 1 U PRBC
intraoperatively for hct 26.8. Per daughter, patient is somewhat
confused and currently an unreliable historian, thus I relied on
her daughter for hx. Her daughter states that her mom first
started c/o diffuse abdominal pain but particularly subxiphoidal
abdominal pain on Friday. Her mother states that the pain was
occasionally worse w/ eating but her daughter states that her
mom was eating a full liquid diet. She has been vomiting,
however. Occasionally it is the food she just ate and other
times she will vomit up her pills. However, she had soup and
jello this am w/o vomiting. Her mom has also been c/o back pain
but as far as her daughter can tell this is just her chronic
LBP. She doesn't seem to relate the pain to her abdominal pain.
Patient's daughter thinks her mom's last BM was on Friday but
she is really not sure. Per notes, patient spiked temp of 101 at
rehab. Patient's daughter is not aware of any h/o PUD or CAD in
her mother. Fran Cucinotta mom did have a gall bladder attack severeal
years ago leading to CCY, but o/w no abdominal surgeries/issues.
+ h/o BRBPR. Daughter not sure if she's had a c-scope in the
past. Daughter is not aware of any urinary complaints

On further ROS:
Patient has been having hallucinations which started in the
hospital, attributed to pain medications.

+ SOB which is worse if she lies flat since her last admission
to UPMCE

Per notes, her mother also reported some chest tightness.

Unit admission:

CT abd/pelvis 2009-04-24 00:00:00:
1. Mild dilatation of the distal common duct with no
choledocholithiasis, unchanged from the prior ultrasound.
2. Status post cholecystectomy.
3. Likely left renal cyst, although too small to characterize.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
5. Calcified fibroids.
6. Bilateral 2 cm adrenal masses, which cannot be characterized
further on this study.
7. Fluid collection in the left groin, presumably related to
recent
catheterization. 6.0 x 3.0 cm

RUQ U/S 2009-04-24 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Diffusely prominent common duct, as described above,
unchanged in appearance from the patient's 123 Any St.us ultrasound
exam of 2009-04-24 00:00:00. This
finding is likely related to the remote history of
cholecystectomy. Otherwise, an unremarkable right upper quadrant
ultrasound.

CXR 2009-04-24 00:00:00:
Right hilar fullness on the AP view without a definite

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F w/ h/o hyperchol, ? T2DM, asthma, and h/o PVD s/p
bilateral MTA, most recently on the right (2009-04-24 00:00:00) who presents
from rehab w/ c/o RUQ abd pain x 3 days.

# Abdominal pain/vomiting
CT abd/pelvis did not show anything that might explain this
patient's presenting complaint. Her LFTs were slightly elevated
on presentation concerning for possible cholestasis postop but
they essentially normalized. Her statin was held
prophylactically. Hepatitis panel was unremarkable, positive for
hep A IgG but negative for hep A IgM. Her h/o vomiting was
concerning for pancreatitis but her lipase/amylase WNL. Given ?
h/o BM, we considered constipation as a cause of her abdominal
pain and tx w/ aggressive bowel regimen. Consideration was made
for a RP bleed or leaking AAA given h/o left groin hematoma
following cath 2009-04-24 00:00:00 but her presenting pain was in the RUQ, in
addition to c/o her chronic L4/5 back pain. In addition her hct
remained stable and her CT was unremarkable. Ms. Cucinotta had no
h/o PUD but did report h/o BRBPR years ago so we considered a
possible stress ulcer and tx her accordingly w/ PPI, guiacing
all her stools. There was no lactic acisosis to suggest ischemic
gut and her lytes were WNL. She ultimately ended up being dx w/
urosepsis. Her urine cx showed > 100K colonies/ml of
enterococcus sensitive to amp/levo/vanc. Plan to tx w/ vanc x 10
days (long duration of antibx for concurrent MTA cellulitis).
Patient currently has no further c/o abdominal pain.

# Decreased MS
Fran Cucinotta on initial presentation given pinpoint pupils,
h/o hallucinations, and being tx w/ dilaudid, MS contin, and
neurontin at rehab. However, her MS Fran Cucinotta despite
holding pain medications, at which time patient was found to be
hypotensive (70/palp w/ doppler assist). She was transiently
started on pressors, aggressively hydrated, and MS returned to
123 Any St. w/in 24 hours. She was thus also dx w/ urosepsis. Of
note, blood cultures were negative for any growth.
Folate/B12/TSH/RPR were all unremarkable. CXR was w/o
infiltrate.

# Fever/leukocytosis
Patient ultimately dx w/ enterococcal UTI and right stump
cellulitis. Plan to tx w/ a total of 10 days of vancomycin +
zosyn. Of note, CXR w/o overt infiltrate. She did have loose
stools this admission but was c diff neg x 3. Blood cx were no
growth.

# Hypocortisolism
Patient w/ cortisol 1.1 on transfer to ICU. She was noted to
have bilateral adrenal masses which will need to be w/u as
outpatient as potential cause of adrenal insufficiency. Due to
patient's hypotn, she was tx w/ stress dosed steroids which will
be tapered to off as an outpatient.

# right MTA cellulitis
Patient p/w mild cellulitis of her right MTA stump. This
improved on antibx. Vascular was consulted and recommended,
ultimately BKA. However, given patient is s/p urosepsis and on
stress dose steroids, plan for d/c to rehab w/ plan to return
for BKA in the future. She will undergo persantine MIBI prior to
d/c for cardiac risk stratification preop. She will need to be
on ASA and BB perioperatively. Her home BB was restarted on the
day of d/c. Dr. Joyceline Soignier is her vascular surgeon and is adamant
that patient remain anticoagulated for dx hypercoagulable state.
Her coumadin was held prior to d/c given supratherapeutic INR
while on antibx. Today her INR is 1.9 so we will start lovenox
and restart her coumadin w/ goal INR 2-2.5, at which time
lovenox can be d/c.

# CV
- CAD: cath 2009-04-24 00:00:00 w/ clean coronaries, EF > 60%, no CP this
admission
- Pump: bp well controlled, no failure on CXR
- sinus rhythm

# h/o asthma: Patient was tx w/ scheduled atrovent w/ albuterol
prn given somewhat wheezy on exam.

# Chronic anemia: Hct stable. Checking iron studies/folate/b12.

# IDDM: RSSI. DM diet. Checking hgb A1c to further characterize.

# PPX: PPI, on coumadin, bowel regimen, aspiration/fall precxs

# FEN:
Patient initially p/w mild hyponatremia (Na 133, down from
135-138 on last admission). Patient did not appear severely dry
on exam but given h/o decreased MS, I suspected hypovolemic
hyponatremia. However, after 1 L NS, patient's Na was down to
127. Patient's daughter had given h/o ? orthopnea at rehab and
given patient's response to NS, patient was postulated to be
hypervolemic. Thus, attempt was made for diuresis w/ lasix. This
also did not improve patient's sodium and bp decreased to
85/palp. Patient subsequently responded to 1L NS bolus and was
kept on maintenance NS o/n but in the AM was hypotn to 70/palp
w/ sodium back up to 136. After aggressive rehydration in the
ICU, her sodium improved further to 142. Her sodium has been
stable since.

Patient maintained on DM/cardiac diet. She underwent swallow
evaluation which showed no evidence of aspiration.

# Access: Patient has difficult access. Thus, a right UE PICC
placed.
# Full code
# Dispo: to rehab, return for BKA in future
