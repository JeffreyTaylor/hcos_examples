UPMCE on the evening of 2013-10-24 00:00:00 with chief
complaint of found unresponsive.  History obtained from sister

phosphenytoin 1000mg x1.   An EEG on 2013-10-24 00:00:00 showed rare Left
temporal sharps but no seizures.  The fever workup included
UA/UCx, BCx, chest x-ray, non contrast head CT, and an LP.  None
of these was revealing.  The patient was felt to be in a
protracted post-ictal state.  A decision was made to transfer
the

protection, given the concern that she might seize en route.

82 years of age is in good health.  One sister is 42 and also
suffers from a demyelinating disease, (suspected multiple
sclerosis) which has affected her cognition more than her motor
and sensory systems.  This sister has responded well to
Solumedrol infusions and Rebif in the past with resolved speech
and swallowing problems.  Faustine Bendele had one paternal uncle with
suspected multiple sclerosis (diagnosed at age 27, died at 42),
another paternal uncle with paranoid schizophrenia, another

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted to the ICU where she did well. she continued to
have fevers in the ICU without obvious source.

Neuro:
Pt was loaded with dilantin with improvement in seizures.
EEG: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry in the
waking and sleeping states due to the slow and disorganized
background
rhythm suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. This may
be
seen with medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities, or
infections. There are no regions of focal slowing and no
epileptiform
discharges noted.

She was extubated without incident and repeat EEG without
evidence of electrographic seizures.  pt without Bendele
activity for the rest of her hospital stay. dilantin level was
low, but with possibility that dilantin was cause of fever,
dilantin was discontinued.

pt with improving encephalopathy during stay with return to
fairly baseline mental status, although with continued decreased
strength in her LE and decreased ability to ambulate.

ID: pt continued to have daily fevers.  Abx stopped with
negative cultures. acyclovir CT torso without source.  US of
gallbladder and LE were both negative for source.  HSV PCR at
OSH was not resulted.  Repeat LP was performed without CSF
pleiocytosis so acyclovir was stopped.  Without source,
consideration of possible drug fever.  dilantin level had been
low without Bendele activity.  dilantin was weaned off without
issue with resolution of fever.

PT/OT evaluated the patient and felt that she would benefit
significantly from acute rehabilitation placement.

GI: pt with some difficulty eating. Speech and swallow evaluated
her and found her to have difficulty with solids.  patient's
diet was changed to softs which she tolerated well.
