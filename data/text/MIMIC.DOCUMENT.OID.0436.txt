History of Present Illness:
Ms. Laurich is a 60-year-old female with past medical history
significant for Bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, multiple suicide attempts, h/o alcoholism, PTSD, COPD
on home O2, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy who presented to ED via
EMS after being found disoriented and wandering around her
housing complex barefoot with 1 empty and 1 full bottle of
clonazepam. She had 1 empty bottle of clonazepam filled 2009-07-31 00:00:00
with 0 tablets and a 2nd bottle of clonazepam filled with 39
pills (filled yesterday, so 21 tablets gone). She is supposed to
be taking up to 4 pills per day per 2009-07-31 00:00:00. Patient states on
further history that she dropped "a bunch" of her clonazepam
tablets fell on the floor. She repeatedly denies any overdose.

She was initially very agitated and unable to give detailed
history. She also c/o pain all over her body pain and was
slightly tremulous at rest. Per patient, she also complained of
having recently run out of her home 02 a "few days ago" which
she takes for history of COPD.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 100.1, HR 83, BP 116/86,
RR 20 and O2 sat 99% 2L . She denied fevers, cough, dysuria or
abdominal pains on ROS in ED. She was a limited historian
however, and difficult as she refused FSG and refused attempt at
LP. Despite negative ETOH level she claims she has been drinking
a bottle of wine daily but also made several confusing
statements about timeline of her ETOH use so it is unclear if
she actively using alcohol now. CT head and CXR in ED were both
negative. EKG also showed normal intervals, NSR with no
concerning ST changes. While in ED, she received 1.5L NS IVFs.
2mg Ativan, 5mg Haldol and 50mg Benadryl for agitation which
slowly improved through the afternoon. She was also given 1x
dose 2g Ceftriaxone to cover possible urinary source and
meningitis per ED resident although given no headaches and
normal neuro exam there was limited concern for meningitis as
her AMS improved in the ED.

Given notice of recent TSH of 50 that has been untreated an
endocrinology consult was also called from 123 Any St. and patient was
given 200mcg IV levothyroxine. Per report, endocrinology service
did not feel she was in overt myxedema coma but felt her
metabolism of recent drugs likely impaired given her severe
hypothyroidism.

On arrival to UPMCE, initial vital signs were: T 99.3F, BP
107/58, HR 77, RR 22 and O2 sat 98% on 2L NC. She seemed mildly
confused and very easily agitated and refused to answer multiple
questions. In no apparent distress.

ECG 2009-07-31 00:00:00: Sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, likely left
ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2009-07-31 00:00:00 findings are
similar.

2009-07-31 00:00:00 CXR PORTABLE AP:
INDICATION: 60-year-old female with altered mental status.

COMPARISON: 2009-07-31 00:00:00.

CHEST, AP: The lungs are clear, other than some mild
retrocardiac
atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. There are no pleural effusions. No acute fractures are
identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 2009-07-31 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large areas
of edema,
large masses or mass effect. Clerence Birdinground-white matter differentiation
is preserved.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. Mucosal thickening/mucous retention cyst is noted
within the left maxillary sinus.  Otherwise, the visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Visualized
soft tissues of the orbits and nasopharynx are within normal
limits.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
60yo F with h/o bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, PTSD, fibromyalgia, multiple suicide attempts, COPD on
home O2, cervical neck fracture (in chronic brace), and severe
OA who presents with altered mental status after questionable
overdose.

Questionable Overdose/AMS: Head CT in ED was within normal
limits and neuro exam also non-focal. No evidence of infection,
the patient also admits to ETOH so her initial presentation
could have been withdrawal and seizure but no witnessed seizure
activity and ETOH serum negative (although w/d obviously still
would be possible in the setting of neg ETOH).  The patient was
found to be unresponsive in the setting of an open klonopin
bottle on the floor, although the patient adamantly denied a
suidcide attempt this was still a very likely possibility as she
was on multiple sedating medications and no other organic cause
for change in level of consciousness could be found.  In
addition patient improved with time / medication washout.

BIPOLAR DISORDER: The patient was on multiple psychotropic
medications.  These were held inpt, risperdal 1mg po qhs was
started back while inpatient. The patient is medically cleared
for discharge to a psychiatric facility.

HYPONATREMIA: She had dilute urine but admits to taking in large
amounts of water, hypothyroidism also a likely contributer.  1
liter free H2O restriction and levothyroxine.

COPD: no active flare. continue low flow 2-3L O2 via nasal
cannula for O2 sats >90% goal, on home O2.

Fever: Unclear etiology. Also has an elevated WBC to 17 with 85%
PMN shift. CXR with no clear infiltrates. She has fairly normal
UA despite complaints of dysuria "off and on". No abdominal pain
but does mention recent diarrhea. Lactate is WNL at 1.6 and
patient has stable vitals throughout hospitalization.  2 days of
afebrile prior to discharge.

Hypothyroidism: Endocrine consulted, continue levothyroxine
50mcg daily and recheck TSH in 6 weeks.

Cervical spine fracture (in chronic brace):
--continue soft neck brace
--pain control with lidocaine patch
--Tylenol PRN (serum tox acetominophen level negative)

Mild systolic CHF: last EF 45% back in 2009-07-31 00:00:00. Written for
home dose of 40mg PO BID lasix. Seems dry on exam and states she
has been having diarrhea for few days.  Continue lasix 40mg po
daily and follow up as outpatient.
