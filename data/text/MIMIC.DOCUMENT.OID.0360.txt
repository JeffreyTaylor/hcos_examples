History of Present Illness:
37F with PMH DM1, transferred from OSH for lethargy and DKA. Pt
relates that last week she developed severe headaches for which
her PCP got an MRI and diagnosed her with cluster headache. She
had a tooth filled 3 week prior, and last week damaged the tooth
opening a bottle with it. Her dentist again filled the tooth
last Friday and over the past week she has been treated for a
right sided tooth infection, initially with amoxicillin, but she

she noted significantly increased right sided facial swelling
and pressure. Two days prior to admission, she experienced
drainage of purulent material from the gums surrounding the
infected tooth. Denies fever, chills, diarrhea, dysuria, pelvic
pain, cough, sputum production. She concommitently developed
fatigue, lethargy, vomiting, nausea with decreased PO intake.
She has been taking her usual insulin regimen of lantus 16 Qhs
plus mealtime lispro 3-5unit SS, with finger sticks not above

Brief Hospital Course:
37F with PMH DM1, admitted to the ICU for lethargy and DKA.
.
# DKA/DMI: Patient presented to OSH with elevated BG >300, urine
ketones, and an AG of 18 as well as nausea, vomitting, h/o
fever. DKA appears to have been instigated by tooth infection.
Patient has no other obvious source of infection, CXR showed no
signs of acute process. Nausea managed with reglan. Electrolytes
(K+, phos, Ca+, Mg) checked frequently and repleted as needed.
Patient was maintained on an insulin drip with D5W given BG<200.
AG trended: 18->12->11. Drip stopped briefly overnight for
decreased BG in 60s. Restarted and in the morning, patient was
transitioned over to home regimen of 16units glargine and HISS
with dicontinuation fo D5W. Patient was given a DM diet. AG
reopened slightly to 14 and HISS was uptitrated. 8pm AG
normalized to 10. Urine hcg negative, trop neg x2. ECG x2 both
showing sinus tachycardia with t-wave inversions. No suggestion
of cardiac event. Savo was consulted, who made some revisions
to her insulin sliding scale and will arrange for outpatient
follow-up for the patient with her regular Savo provider. Jamonta Savo
note, her A1C is >11.7 and the patient acknolwedges poor
follow-up with Savo in the past (yearly, at best).
.
# Mixed anion gap and nonanion gap acidosis: Patient has an AG
acidosis with AG of 18 on presentation, which can be explained
by the DKA/ketoacidosis.  Her delta gap is 2 (18/16), suggesting
a mixed acidosis. Her non anion gap acidosis is possibly
multifactorial: vomitting vs. hyperchloremic (Cl 111) likely due
to IVF resuscitation. Nausea was managed with reglan and NS
fluids were avoided. Bicarb on presentation was 8, and within a
day improved to 20. DKA was treated as above.
.
# Hypokalemia: In ED, patient with K+ 3.2. Got 40meq re[** Location **]n,
just prior to arrival to floor. Patient at risk for low
potassium with treatment for DKA. Potassium was checked q4h
while on insulin drip and repleted as needed. Her potassium
levels stabilized.
.
# Tachycardia: Patient remained in the 90s-100s HR. Given DKA,
she was likely volume depleted. Patient does have signs of a
tooth infection, so sepsis is possible, however blood pressures
remain in the 110s/80s. Patient had elevated HR and increased
WBC. Not febrile or hypothermic, breathing at a comfortable
rate. She was maintained on IVFs initially and monitored on
telemetry, without events. 2 EKGs showed sinus tachycardia with
t-wave inversions. Patient denied chest pain, has been nauseous
(attributed to DKA and infection), and trops negative x2.
Patient was treated for her infection and volume resuscitated,
with resolution of tachycardia.
.
# Tooth infection: Patient with recent instrumentation and
evidence of tooth infection for which she has been treated with
ampicillin and flagyl with continued symptoms. She was given an
initial dose of unasyn 3gm in the ED (D1 2010-12-09 00:00:00 in PM), which
was continued q6h during hospitalization. Patient was with some
gum swelling on exam but no tenderness or purulent drainage. WBC
12.6 on admission and decreased to WNL thereafter. She was
transitioned to Augmentin upon transfer from the ICU to the
regular medicine floors without issues.

# Anemia: During this admission the patient's hct trended down
to a nadir of 26 on the day of discharge. There was no evidence
of bleeding. On review of prior hospitalizations the patient's
hct does range from the high 20's to low 30's. MCV was normal,
which suggests ACD. The patient was notified that she should
have her anemia further evaluated as an outpatient, and was
educated about signs and symptoms of bleeding.
