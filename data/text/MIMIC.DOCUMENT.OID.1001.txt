Date of Birth: 1961-03-15 00:00:00 00:00:00       Sex:  M

Service:  ICU/ACOVE

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Sepsis, aspiration pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old gentlemen
with end stage liver disease secondary to NASH, diabetes
mellitus, esophageal varices, status post banding, who was
recently hospitalized at UPMCE
from 2008-03-15 00:00:00 through 2008-03-15 00:00:00 for spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis and anemia.  He was then discharged to
a skilled nursing facility where he was found to have a
change in mental status on the morning of admission (2008-03-15 00:00:00).  Fingerstick glucose was found to be 40.  He was given
glucagon, oral glucose and sent to UPMCE.
A chest x-ray there showed likely aspiration pneumonia and
fingerstick glucose was noted to be 30 with an oxygen
saturation of 77% on room air.  He was given Zosyn, put on a
nonrebreather face mask and transferred to UPMCE.  At the UPMCE
Emergency Room he was placed into the sepsis protocol.  He
received a total of 8 liters of intravenous fluids, 1 gram of
vancomycin.  His systolic blood pressure was in the 60s to
70s and then he was placed on a Levophed drip with increase
in the blood pressure to a systolic blood pressure to the
90s.  His temperature was noted to be 103 with course rigors.
He was oxygenating at 95% on a 15 liter nonrebreather face
mask.

The patient does not recall the events leading up to
hospitalization.  He does recall some shaking chills starting
the day prior to admission at the skilled nursing facility,
but denies any subjective fevers.  He had had some increased
diarrhea prior to admission about 2008-03-15 00:00:00 bouts per day, baseline
2-3 times per day.  He has not been eating well secondary to
poor a123 Any St.e and had a very small dinner the night prior to
admission.  In terms of his insulin regimen, he did take NPH
at his standard dose the night prior to admission and he was
noted to be "shaking" by the registered nurse with a
fingerstick glucose of 40 as described above.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No cough, no dry heaves, no chest
pressure, palpitations.  Positive nausea without emesis, some
mild shortness of breath.  No abdominal pain, no bright red
blood per rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End state liver disease secondary to non alcoholic

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Leeks Intensive Care Unit and then
transferred to the floor on 2008-03-15 00:00:00.

1.  Sepsis:  The patient was placed on a sepsis protocol with
a goal central venous pressure of 2008-03-15 00:00:00.  Serial lactates
were monitored.  The patient was given aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone,
vancomycin and Flagyl.  Levophed was titrated to a mean
arterial pressure greater than 60.  his Lasix, Aldactone and
propanolol were held.  Blood cultures (final report) showed
no evidence of bacteremia.  The septic shock was thought to
be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, although, the chest
x-ray was significant only for mild left lower lobe
atelectasis versus consolidation.  A paracentesis was
performed and was negative for SVP.  A urinalysis was
negative for urinary tract infection.  Stool cultures,
Clostridium difficile and sputum cultures are all negative at
the time of dictation. The Levophed was weaned off on 2008-03-15 00:00:00.  The vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were stopped on
2008-03-15 00:00:00.  The patient was maintained on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.  His
Ciprofloxacin will be continued after this course has been
completed, just once a week q. Tuesday for SVP prophylaxis.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was weaned off of Levophed as
above.  As a result of the aggressive fluid resuscitation
with his 123 Any St.us hypotension to the 60s, he had a resulting
non gap metabolic acidosis.  Please see below.  His Aldactone
was restarted on 2008-03-15 00:00:00 and his Lasix was restarted
as well.  These were titrated up to a dose of Lasix 40 mg po
q.d. and Aldactone 100 mg po q.d. with the patient able to
maintain normal blood pressure control.  The propanolol was
not restarted at the recommendation of the Liver Service
given the patient's lower extremity edema and only Grade 1
varices.

3.  Question of cardiac ischemia:  The patient did have some
pseudonormalization of the T waves in leads V2 through V4.
He was ruled out by enzymes for an myocardial infarction and
he had no significant events on telemetry.

4.  Hypoxia/persistent bibasilar crackles:  Despite the lung
findings, the patient did maintain adequate oxygenation
throughout his hospital course.  Though, crackles did
diminish somewhat when the Lasix and Aldactone were titrated
up.  As stated above, he will be treated with a 14 day course
of levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  There
is some question as to underlying interstitial lung disease,
but no further information is available at this time on that
speculation.

5.  Cough:  The patient did have persistent dry cough that
was somewhat controlled with Tessalon pearls and Robitussin.
It did improve after diuresis on the floor.

6.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  Initially the patient was noted
to have a hematocrit drop from 39 to 28 in the Emergency
Room.  This was felt to be likely dilutional post 7 liters of
intravenous fluid.  However, given the patient's guaiac
positive state and questionable bloody emesis in the
Emergency Room, Gastroenterology was consulted and they did
not feel that the patient had an active gastrointestinal
bleed and had only Grade 1 varices, therefore, they
recommended maintaining him on Protonix and falling
hematocrit.  The patient's hematocrit was 30.8 on 2008-03-15 00:00:00.  It did range from a nadir of 22.9 to a maximum of
39.5.  He was transfused for a hematocrit goal greater than
27.

7.  Coagulopathy:  he does have an underlying coagulopathy
secondary to hepatic dysfunction.  He was given subcutaneous
Vitamin K for a total of three days.  However, his INR was
persistently in the 1.6 to 1.8 range. Given his lack of frank
bleeding, no additional doses of Vitamin K were administered
on the floor.

8.  Change in mental status:  It is most likely that the
patient's change in mental status is secondary to
hypoglycemia.  Other considerations would be delirium versus
medications versus sepsis.  He was maintained on lactulose
t.i.d. titrated to three bowel movements a day.  He does have
a history of hyperammonemia in the past, and his ammonia
level at the time of admission was 38.  Although, this is not
a very specific finding.

9.  Decreased urine output:  Initially the patient had
decreased urine output, and there was some concern for
hepatorenal syndrome, however, after aggressive fluid
resuscitation, his urine output returned to 123 Any St. with
greater than 1 cc/kg/hour of urine output.

10.  SVP:  The patient did have a history of SVP and a
paracentesis was performed on 2008-03-15 00:00:00 which showed no
evidence of SVP.  The acidic fluid contained 345 white blood
cells, 275 red blood cells, 6% polys, 29% lymphocytes, 23%
monocytes, 9% mesothelial cells, 33% macrophages and was felt
to be negative for SVP.  Nevertheless, as a prophylactic
measure, he will be maintained on 750 mg of Ciprofloxacin q.
week.

11.  Diabetes mellitus:  Initially the NPH and regular
insulin standing doses were held given his hypoglycemia and
mental status changes.  He was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale in house with good effect, his total insulin
requirement per day.  The patient was requiring approximately
20 units of regular insulin per day.  He will be placed on 5
units of NPH q.a.m., 5 units NPH q.p.m. with further
monitoring in the outpatient setting for effect, titrated up
as tolerated.

12.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition/metabolic acidosis:
Initially the patient had a primary metabolic acidosis likely
secondary to lactic acidosis secondary to septic shock with
compensatory respiratory alkalosis.  Following the resolution
of the patient's sepsis, he had a normal anion gap acidosis
likely secondary to aggressive fluid hydration as well as
diarrhea with a urine anion gap that was less than 12.

13.  Prophylaxis:  He was maintained on Pneumoboots while in
bed.

14.  Social support:  The patient has multiple social
stressors at home at the moment.  Glendora Leeks from Social
Work was consulted and numerous discussions were conducted
with the patient's family, both in the Intensive Care Unit
and then on the floor regarding his impending divorce, as
well as the stress of being taken off of the liver transplant
list.  At this time, the family is extremely frustrated with
the level of care that the patient requires.  He will likely
need long-term care.

15.  Goals of care:  There were numerous discussions
regarding the patient's code status and goals of care in the
Intensive Care Unit and on the floor.  The patient did at
times state that he would not want to be on a ventilator, but
then the next moment would state that he would want to be on
the ventilator.  Given the uncertainty of the patient's true
goals of care in the setting of change in mental status and
hospitalization, he was maintained as a full code throughout
his hospital stay.  It is recommended that these issues be
re-addressed in the outpatient setting when the patient is
able to think through his goals of care more clearly.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To acute rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Insulin NPH 5 q.a.m., 5 q.p.m.
2.  Insulin sliding scale.
3.  Albuterol 1-2 puffs q. 6 hours.

per day.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Septic shock.
2.  End stage liver disease.
3.  Aspiration pneumonia.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.  He should follow-up as needed with
the Hepatology Service, however, he is no longer a candidate
for orthotropic liver transplant at this time.  The patient
should also follow-up with his primary medical doctor within
two weeks of leaving the hospital.  He is advised to inform
his doctors Glendora Leeks of any confusion, chest pressure,
shortness of breath, palpitations, edema, fevers, chills,
nausea, or vomiting.
