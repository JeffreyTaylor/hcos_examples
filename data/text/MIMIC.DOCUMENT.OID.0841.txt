Chief Complaint:
transfer s/p pericardial window

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
In brief, this is a 34 yoF with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
multiple atrial arrhythmias including atrial tachycardia, atrial
fibrillation, left atrial tachycardia, and AVNRT s/p recent
pulmonary vein isolation procedure 2010-05-09 00:00:00 c/b peristent atrial
tachycardia, respiratory failure and pneumonia who was
readmitted to UPMCE on 2010-05-09 00:00:00 with chest pain and shortness of
breath.  She initially presented to an OSH w/ intermittent 2010-05-09 00:00:00
chest pain radiating to the arms associated with SOB. CT chest
was negative for PE or dissection. She was found to have a
pericardial effusion with RV compression as well as a
pericardial clot on TTE.  She was sent to the OR for pericardial
window on 2010-05-09 00:00:00 which showed "fluid under pressure" without
complication. She was extubated on POD 1 without incident.  She
had elevated CVPs and was diuresed with improvement in CVPs from
30s->20s.  Post-op, also had Atach w/ 2010-05-09 00:00:00 and was loaded with IV
amio. Her home dose verapamil also initiated with improved HR
control.  Chest tube was discontinued today, 2010-05-09 00:00:00.  Patient
continues to breath comfortably, but with significant O2
requirement.
.
Currently, the patient complains of discomfort at prior chest
tube site as well as very mild SOB but improving.  She denies
any other complaints at this time.

Cardiac History:
The patient initially presented with syncope at age of l2. At
l3, the patient was seen at UPMCE for history of
syncope, chest pain and progressive exercise intolerance. She
was found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. She was
subsequently cathed. Left
ventricular end diastolic pressure was found to be 20. She was
then started on chronic Verapamil therapy. At age l6, she
experienced cardiac arrest secondary to complex tachycardia. She
was successfully resuscitated. Repeat catheterization showed
left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 36-40 without outflow
tract obstruction. EP showed inducible atrial flutter with a
rapid ventricular blood pressure. She was felt to have a rapid
antegrade
conduction and possible pre-excitation. She was started on
Norpace. Since then, the patient has been stable on Verapamil
and Norpace with occasional palpitations, chest pain and light
headedness.

TTE 2010-05-09 00:00:00:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion with an echodense anterior epicardial collection. No
right atrial or right ventricular diastolic colla123 Any St. seen.

IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion without echo signs of
tamponade. Anterior echodense epicardial collection, likely
representing a thrombus.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-05-09 00:00:00,
the findings are similar.

Cardiac MR:
There was normal epicardial fat distribution. The myocardium
appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence of
myocardial fatty infiltration. The pericardial thickness was
mildly thickened, without CMR evidence of significant
accumulation of thrombus within the pericardial space. There was
a small pericardial effusion and bilateral small to moderate
pleural effusions. There was a moderate degree of epicardial fat
anterior to the right ventricle, which measured up to 16mm in
thickness in the anterior interventricular groove. The origins
of the left main and right coronary arteries were identified in
their customary positions. The indexed diameters of the
ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal. The main
pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly increased. The left
atrial AP dimension was moderately increased. The right and left
atrial lengths in the 4-chamber view were moderately and
severely increased, bilaterally. The coronary sinus diameter was
normal.
The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index was normal.
The end- diastolic volume index was normal. The calculated left
ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 67% with normal
regional systolic function. There was no abnormal septal motion
to suggest constriction, although this cannot be excluded. The
anteroseptal wall thickness was mildly thickened and the
inferolateral wall thickness was normal, to a degree which met
criteria for asymmetric left ventricualr hypertrophy (greater
than 1.5:1). The left ventricular mass index was normal. The
right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal. The
calculated right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at
64%, with normal free wall motion.

Quantitative Flow
There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt. Aortic flow
demonstrated no significant aortic regurgitation. The calculated
mitral valve regurgitant fraction was consistent with moderate
to severe mitral regurgitation. The resultant effective forward
LVEF was mildly reduced at 46%. The right ventricular stroke
volume and pulmonic flow demonstrated no significant pulmonic
and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Myocardial Fibrosis
There was regional hyperenhancement in the anteroseptum and
inferoseptum at the right ventricular insertion site, consistent
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There was no focal
hyperenhancement in the ventricular or atrial free walls to
suggest myocardial injury or perforation.

Pulmonary Vein MR Angiography
Three right-sided pulmonary veins and two left-sided pulmonary
veins were identified, all entering the left atrium and free of
focal stenoses (dimensions listed above). The multiplanar
reconstructions confirmed the above findings. There was a mild
decrease in the cross-sectional area of the left lower pulmonary
vein (28%) without CMR evidence of obstruction.

Additional Findings
Mild hilar lymphadenopathy and a borderline enlarged pretracheal
lymph node measuring 22 x 14 mm were seen.

Impression:
1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left
ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 67%. The
effective forward LVEF was mildly reduced at 46%. No CMR
evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction. Late
gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrating areas of
hyperenhancement in the anteroseptum and inferoseptum as
described above.
2. There is no CMR evidence of myocardial rupture or significant
thrombus within the pericardium. The pericardium is mildly
thickened. A small pericardial effusion was seen. There is a
moderate amount of epicardial fat in the anterior
interventricular groove.
3. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was normal at 64%.
4. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.
5. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly increased.
6. Moderate right and severe left atrial enlargement.
7. Normal size and orientation of the pulmonary veins without
CMR evidence of pulmonary vein stenosis. There was a mild
decrease in the cross-sectional area of the left lower pulmonary
vein.
8. No evidence of pericardial constriction found.

Compared to the prior study of 2010-05-09 00:00:00, the mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation has worsened, and the pericardial
effusion is new.

LENIS:
1. No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

CT chest w/contrast 2010-05-09 00:00:00:
. Mild cardiogenic pulmonary edema characterized by the presence
of scattered ground-glass opacities, septal thickening, and
cardiomegaly, particularly the left atrium.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis with adjacent small right more than
left pleural effusion.
3. A right upper lobe consolidation with cavitation worrisome
for pneumonia.
4. A left upper lobe wedge-shaped non-enhancing opacity
worrisome for pulmonary infarct secondary to a coexistent
pulmonary embolism.
Further evaluation to exclude or confirm coexistent pulmonary
embolism is recommended. Information was telephoned to Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1863**] Gruszka at approximately 4:30 p.m.
5.The lymph nodes are rather enlarged for a cardiogenic cause
like heart
failure.Other causes including neoplam should be investigated.

CT abd/pelvis 2010-05-09 00:00:00:
. Consolidation within the right middle lobe has the appearance
of pneumonia. Direct comparison to the prior chest CT is not
possible. There are two non enhancing foci within the
atelectatic changes of the both lower lobes which might
represent foci of infection.

2. Interval increase in moderate right and small left pleural
effusion.

3. Free fluid in the pelvis presacral space possibly due to CHF.

4. No intraabdominal source of infection is identified.

Right heart cath 2010-05-09 00:00:00:
1.  In the cath laboratory holding area before the procedure
began Ms.
Gruszka became hypoxic with pulse oximetery showing saturations
85-95%.
Coincident with the hypoxic she had junctional bradycardia with
a
ventricular rate of approximately 20 bpm.  She was given
atropine and
transcutaneous pacing pads were applied.  Transcutaneous pacing
was
begun with electrical capture of the ventricle, however she soon
became
pulseless.  CPR was promptly begun.  She recieved several
epinephrine IV
boluses.  Multiple attempts were made for arterial access
without
success.  She was intubated without difficultly by Dr. Gruszka
from
anesthesia.  Compressions were continued throughout this time,
stopping
only to check pulses.  An echocardiogram was done that showed no

reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.  She regained her pulse
intermittently throughout this period.  She was started on
continous
epinephrine, levophed, and neosyne123 Any St.e infusions.  Possible
hyperkalemia was treated with CaCl, insulin, and bicarbonate.
Bilateral
breath sounds were present thoughout the event. Ultrasound was
used to
access the right axiallary vein.
2.  The patient was then moved from the holding area into the
catheterization laboratory.  Resting hemodynamics revealed an
elevated
mean right atrial pressure of 37 mmHg.  There was pulmonary
arterial
hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 72/38
(systolic/diastolic in mmHg).  Mean pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure
was markedly elevated at 39 mmHg.  Cardiac index was perserved
at 2.6
l/min/m2.
3.  Floroscopy was performed to confirm endotrachial tube
position.  At
this time there was noted to be a large right pleural fluid
collection
and possible pneumothorax.  The pulmonary service promptly
placed a
chest tube.
4.  Given the elevated filling pressures and liklihood of
minimal
diuresis given the presumed insult to her kidneys during the
arrest,
renal was called and placed a left femoral hemodyalsis catheter
to be
used upon transfer to the CCU.
5.  Before transfer to CCU she had adequate blood pressure and
vasopressors were weened to minimal levels.
6.  Drs. Gruszka and Jacklon Gruszka present throughout all events above.
Report
given to Drs. Gruszka, Jacklon Gruszka, and the CCU housestaff who will
continue
care.

RUQ U/S:
Unremarkable study. No cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
34 yo F with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, multifocal atrial
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, left atrial tachycardia, and
AVNRT, obesity, anxiety s/p recent pulmonary vein isolation
procedure admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath found
to have a pericardial effusion with compression of RV now s/p
pericardial window w/ improved heart rate control but persistent
volume overload.
.
# pericardial effusion:  She received a pericardial window on
2010-05-09 00:00:00 with multiple follow up echocardiograms showing no
reacculmulation of the fluid. The fluid was negative for all
infectious and malignant studies.
.
# Rhythm. History of multiple atrial tachyarrhythmias s/p recent
failed ablation.  Anticoagulated w/ coumadin as outpt. Patient
was initially controlled with verapamil and was then loaded with
amiodarone. She was initially in normal sinus rhythm but then
converted to atrial fibrillation. He rate control was changed to
metoprolol and titrated up with good effect. She was continued
on a heparin drip during her admission and restarted on her
coumadin. For control of her rate, patient was titrated up to
100mg PO TID of metoprolol, increased to 200mg PO BID of
amiodarone, and started on verapamil 40mg TID. The EP service
was following the patient, and no indication for emergent AV
ablation/pacemaker placement during this hospitalization,
however, may consider this at a later date. Prior to procedure,
R PICC and US evaluation of carotid and subclavian vessels will
need to be done.  She was reanticoagulated with heparin bridge
to coumadin and on day of discharge INR was 2.0
.
# Pump
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy w/o obvious obstruction on ECHO. The
patient appeared to be volume overloaded on presentation to the
CCU and initially responded well to IV lasix. However, she
eventually became more resistant to lasix and started to retain
fluid. However, her fluid status became unclear as her labs
appeared consistent with hypovolemia but her exam was consistent
with hypervolemia. She was sent to the cath lab on 2010-05-09 00:00:00 for a PA
line. She was given 1 unit of FFP prior to reverse an elevated
INR. She was found in the holding area pulseless and in
bradycardic PEA arrest. She was actively coded for approximately
1 hour with multiple rounds of epi and atropine. She was
intubated during this time.  She regained a perfusing rhythm. A
PCWP taken at that time was 40, confirming her volume overload
status. She was begun on CVVH for aggressive fluid removal.
Approximately 10-12L was removed in this fashion with subsequent
improvement in her hypoxia with weening to room air.
.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was initially hypoxic due to
volume overload and then was intubated during her PEA arrest.
Fluid was removed with CVVH and she was extubated approximately
6 days later. However, 2 days after that, she had what appeared
to be an aspiration event with subsequent hypoxia requiring
reintubation.  Intubation was complicated by pneumothorax for
which she had a right chest tube placed on 2010-05-09 00:00:00.  She was
treated for an aspiration pneumonia with aztreonam and
clindamycin for a total 10 day course. She again extubated and
did well, eventually weaning to room air.
.
# anterior commisure granuloma
In the setting of her intubations, she developed hoarseness.
ENT was consulted who felt patient had a anterior commissure
granuloma.  They recommended PPI therapy and outpatient followup
after discharge to ensure resolution of the granuloma.  She
shoul call test@mail.com to schedule an appointment
.
# Acute Renal Failure due to acute tubular necrosis: The patient
developed anuric renal failure after her PEA arrest from
hypotension associated ATN. She was initially management with
CVVH with good effect. A right IJ tunnelled triple lumen
catheter was placed. She was eventually transitioned to daily
HD. Her Cr continued to improve 1.1 at time of discharge.  Renal
consult team felt that she was unlikely to require dialysis in
the future and R IJ HD line was removed on day of discharge.
She was given 1 unit of FFP prior to removal of this line as her
INR was 2.0.
.
# Leukocytosis and Fever
The patient has had a persistent leukocytosis with intermittent
fevers initially. She was diagnosed with a RML/RLL pneumonia,
likely aspiration based and completed a 10 day course of
aztreonam and clindamycin. However, her leukocytosis persisted.
No positive culture had been obtained at the time of this
writing including multiple sets of blood cultures, urine
cultures, sputum cultures, a BAL, culture of pleural fluid,
b-glucan, galactomannan, urine legionella, c.diff x3, and a
viral DFA. At the time of this writing, the source of her
leukocytosis is unclear. She did exhibit enlarged lymph nodes on
a CT chest, which may be reactive or related to an unclear
malignancy. She should have a follow up chest CT in
approximately 3 months.
.
# Pancreatitis: On 2010-05-09 00:00:00, the patient noted new onset abdominal
pain and a CT abdomen noted peripancreatic inflammation,
confirmed by chemical pancreatitis. A RUQ U/S showed no gall
stones or cholecystitis. The pancreatitis was likely drug
related, possibly related to the flagyll that she was given
earlier in her pneumonia course. The flagyl was stopped and the
pancreatitis resolved.
.
# left groin wound
slow healing site of catheterization from PVI but on day of
discharge did not appear infected (nontender, no spreading
erythema, no purulent drainage).  Some white granulation tissue
present.  Groin wound should be monitored for progression.
