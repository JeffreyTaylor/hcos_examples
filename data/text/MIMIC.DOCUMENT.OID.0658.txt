Brief Hospital Course:
79yo M with MMP including DMII, CAD s/p MI, PVD, COPD, multiple
malignancies, hypercholesterolemia, and HTN who was admitted to
vascular with toe pain, but then developed hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
# ICU COURSE: Mr. Ruhlman presented to his cardiologist's office
with 7-10 days of increasing pain in his R foot, specifically
his R second toe. His exam at the time was felt to be consistent
with ischemia or cellulitis. His cardiologist referred to the
hospital and he was admitted to the vascular service. He was
started on IV antibiotics (kefzol and flagyl) and a wound
culture grew MSSA. XR showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
Noninvasive vascular studies were performed as the patient was a
known vasculopath and it was assumed that an intervention would
need to be performed to preserve his toe. Studies revealed that
he had extensive plaques in the L common carotid artery,
bilateral internal and external carotid arteries, as well as
significant bilateral iliac, superficial femoral, and tibial
disease. There was retrograde flow in the L vertebral artery
indicating L subclavian steal. On 2005-05-09 00:00:00, while on the vascular
service, he developed nausea and vomiting while moving around
for all of his studies. He was given reglan and anzemet for his
nausea, as well as percocet for his toe pain. He did well until
2005-05-09 00:00:00 when he began to have labored breathing and a decreased O2
sat to 81%. He was felt to be wheezing and he was given
nebulizers with good effect. However, he was then found to be
very tachycardic, with a lot of ectopy on telemetry. He was
given IV metoprolol for his tachycardia, but overnight, again
developed respiratory distress. EKG was unchanged from priors.
It was decided to electively intubate him as his RR was in the
30s-40s and his sats were only in the low 90s on a NRB. His ABG
at the time was 7.14/71/72. He was given 20mg lasix IV and 80mg
IV solumedrol, but he remained in respiratory distress so he was
transferred to the SICU for intubation. He was sedated and CT of
his chest and head were performed to look for causes of his SOB.
CT of his head revealed no intracranial pathology, and the CTA
was negative for PE, but did reveal that he had pleural
effusions. BNP was elevated at the time, so he was given
additional lasix.
.
Mr. Ruhlman was extubated the following evening, with the hope
that treatment for CHF and COPD would have improved his
respiratory status. He did well overnight, but again developed
tachypnea acutely on the morning of 2005-05-09 00:00:00, associated with
wheezing and hypoxia. He was given nebulizer treatments x3,
solumedrol, and lasix with no improvement. Serial ABGs at the
time revealed 7.35/43/63/25/-1 (post-extubation) ->
7.08/81/62/-8 (during his distress) -> 7.28/41/246/-6(post
intubation). On 2005-05-09 00:00:00, a TTE was performed which revealed left
ventricular systolic function of ~40%, which was considered to
be moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal
infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis. An attempt was
made at thoracentesis given his bilateral pleural effusions,
however the IP team did not feel that they could get a good view
through which to tap. An NGT was inserted and tubefeeds were
started.  On 2005-05-09 00:00:00, the decision was made to discontinue the
patient's beta-blocker because of increased wheezing. The
patient's cardiologist instead recommended using verapamil
instead for rate control.
.
Attempt was made at his second extubation on 2005-05-09 00:00:00, but again
he became acutely tachypneic, tachycardic and hypertensive, with
his O2 sats again dropping into the 80s. At this point, he was
reintubated and diuresis was continued. Cardiac enzymes were
cycled x3 and were negative. EP was consulted on 2005-05-09 00:00:00 and felt
that the arrhythmias he was having were consistent with episodes
of MAT/afib, with no episodes of sustained ventricular rhythms.
EP confirmed that the patient needed to be on a beta-blocker,
not a CCB, and brought up the issue of anticoagulation.  They
also recommended continuing with diuresis and attempting
extubation again only after his pulmonary edema had resolved. He
was also started on afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor.
On 2005-05-09 00:00:00, a bronchoscopy was performed for further evaluation
of his copious, thick, blood-tinged secretions and to see if
there is an anatomical reason that Mr. Ruhlman was unable to be
weaned off the vent. BAL culture results were significant for
gram negative rods, raising the concern for ventilator
associated pneumonia. He performed an SBT on 2005-05-09 00:00:00, but developed
tachypnea and tachycardia after just 2 hrs. He was then
transferred to the MICU for help with achieving stable
extubation.
.
In the MICU, his antibiotics were broadened to cover for
Pseudomonas in his sputum (with levaquin and ceftazidime) and he
was given vancomycin for gram positive cocci from his R toe
(which turned out to be MSSA). He was started on an ACE
inhibitor for improved BP control as well as standing nebulizers
and steroids for treatment of his COPD. An insulin gtt was added
to better control his hyperglycemia. Diuresis was continued and
his respiratory status improved. He was able to come down to
pressure support. He passed a SBT and was extubated successfully
on 2005-05-09 00:00:00. He was able to maintain his oxygenation with 40-50%
FiO2 by shovel mask. He was transferred to the floor on 2005-05-09 00:00:00
and by the morning of 2005-05-09 00:00:00, he was down to 2L by nasal
cannula.
.
# PNEUMONIA: He underwent a BAL on 2005-05-09 00:00:00 which grew a
pansensitive Pseudomonas. Mr. Ruhlman completed an 8 day course
of ceftazidime (along with 7 days of levaquin, for double
coverage initially) for the treatment of Pseudomonas ventilator
associated pneumonia on 2005-05-09 00:00:00. He continued to have a
productive cough, but his oxygenation improved. He was able to
maintain stable O2 sats of 100% on 2L by nc, but still was
mildly hypoxemic on RA (91%). CXR showed that he still has small
residual pleural effusions that are resolving.
.
# COPD: Mr. Ruhlman likely had a COPD exacerbation that
contributed to his difficulty in weaning off of the ventilator.
However, he was able to be changed from IV solumedrol to PO
prednisone on the floor. The prednisone taper was started on
discharge and his steroids will be slowly tapered over two
weeks. He was continued on standing albuterol and ipratroprium
nebulizers as he easily became wheezy with any exertion. He was
also given albuterol inhalers prn. There was some concern, as
Ruhlman above, that his beta-blocker worsened his respiratory
status, but the patient seemed to tolerate oral metoprolol
without any exacerbation of his COPD.
.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Mr. Ruhlman WBC began to rise on the floor, at
the same time that he began to have diarrhea. Given that he was
on several antibiotics at the time, there was concern for C diff
infection. Stool studies were sent x2 and were negative for C
diff. He was started on flagyl for empiric treatment of C. diff
and cultures were followed. ID was consulted for advice in the
length of treatment for his Pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as
advise for the treatment of his R toe. ID felt that his
ceftazidime could be discontinued after 8 days, that
levofloxacin was no longer needed for double coverage, and that
his R toe did not look infected, so  vancomycin could also be
discontinued. Ceftazidime was completed on 2005-05-09 00:00:00 and per ID,
Mr. Ruhlman will be continued on flagyl until 2005-05-09 00:00:00. Stool
cultures were sent, including C diff toxin B, which was still
pending upon discharge.
.
# ARRHYTHMIA: Mr. Ruhlman was noted to have various sinus
arrhythmias in the ICU, possibly MAT vs sinus tachycardia with
ectopic beats. He was given beta-blocker for his tachycardia,
but in the ICU, there was concern that the beta-blocker was
worsening his wheezing and COPD, so it was discontinued.
Verapamil was tried instead, but Mr. Ruhlman became very
tachycardic without beta-blockade. EP was consulted while the
patient was in the ICU and recommended discontinuing the
verapamil and going back to metoprolol, which the team did with
improvement in controlling his rate. On transfer to the floor,
Mr. Exodus Ruhlman was continued on telemetry and appeared to have
multiple different rhythms, including MAT, sinus tachycardia
with ectopic beats (both ventricular and atrial) and ventricular
bigeminy. He had episodes of NSVT, maximum of 14 beats, but
remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic throughout all
episodes. His attending recommended increasing the beta-blockade
if possible, but his blood pressure was on the lower side, so he
was maintained on metoprolol 75mg PO TID with adequate rate
control.
.
# PVD: Mr. Ruhlman has a long history of claudication. On
admission, there was concern for cellulitis vs. gangrene in his
R toe.  MRA showed moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease,
but no surgical intervention was planned during this admission
due to his tenous respiratory status. Mr. Ruhlman prefers to have
the summer to heal and would like to pursue whatever
intervention is necessary in the fall. Dr. Ruhlman is aware of
his decision and plans to follow him as an outpatient for now.
Mr. Exodus Ruhlman will follow-up with Dr. Ruhlman 2-3 weeks after
discharge.
.
# DM type II: Mr. Ruhlman had been on an insulin gtt in ICU, with
labile fingersticks. Ruhlman was consulted to help control his
hyperglycemia in the setting of acute illness and the
administration of tube feeds. On the floor, he was changed back
to SC insulin, but became hypoglycemic on the recommended
regimen. His steroid use for his COPD exacerbation and
discontinuation of tube feeds likely contributed to the lability
of his glycemic control. He did have a symptomatic episode of
hypoglycemia on the morning of 2005-05-09 00:00:00 which quickly resolved
with the administration of 1/2amp of D50. He was discharged on
glipizide 5mg daily, which is half of his normal home dose, as
well as a humalog insulin sliding scale while he is still on
prednisone. His glipizide will be titrated as needed at rehab
based on his fingersticks.
.
# FEN: In the ICU, he had an NGT through which he was given tube
feeds. On transfer to the floor, he was reevaluated by speech
and swallow and passed, so he was given  a regular, Arik Linkhorn, heart
healthy diet with thin liquids and soft solids. He needed no
additional IVF upon transfer to the floor. His electrolytes were
checked daily and were repleted prn.
.
# PPX: He received heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis, a PPI for GI
prophylaxis, and a bowel regimen prn.
.
# ACCESS: He had a left subclavian line placed in the ICU on
2005-05-09 00:00:00. He had a PICC line placed in his R forearm 2005-05-09 00:00:00 and
the SC line was pulled on 2005-05-09 00:00:00. After com[** Location **]n of his
antibiotic course, his PICC line was pulled and he was able to
have a peripheral IV.
