History of Present Illness:
Hollon is a 75 y.o. female with pertinent history of MDS x 2
years, chronic anemia requiring blood transfusions (last
transfusion 1 wk prior to admission), and recent admission for
melanotic stools w/ neg GI workup. Pt was recently discharged
2009-10-01 00:00:00 from UPMCE following admission for GIB, and subsequent
stabilization w/o intervention. Following discharge reports that
she was feeling tired and weak, with decreased a123 Any St.e. +for
black, tarry stools (states she has had this intermittently x
6-8 weeks). Denies BRBPR. No abdominal pain. Went to Heme/onc
clnic on day of admission and was found to have a HCT of 10.
Sent to ED where she was af, hr 120, bp 122/56, received 2U PRBC
(with appropriate Hct rise 2009-10-01 00:00:00), and 2L NS. She had been on
Cipro for treatment of asymptomatic UTI x 1day which was changed
on hospital day 2 to Cefepime since she was considered to be
functionally neutropenic with an ANC of 320 and declining. She
was seen in the unit by GI who performed a push enteroscopy on
2009-10-01 00:00:00 despite recent negative EGD and found no source of bleeding
to mid jejunum. She continued to have melenic stools but vitals
remained stable. Despite having no 123 Any St.us cardiac history, she
also developed a mild troponin leak that peaked at 1.04 and CK's
of 160's with 17MB. She was never symptomatic and was treated
medically with aspirin and B-blocker. In total she was
transfused another 4 units PRBC's with appropriate increase in
Hct from 17.4-29.3, which has been stable for the last 12 hours

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Atilio Hollon Pt has undergone extensive endoscopic workup which has
all been negative, although she continued to have melenic stools
now with no BM x 5d. Difficult to assess what proportion of
anemia is due to GIB versus progressoin of her MDS. History of
four known RBC antigens to match versus. She received "weakly
incompatible" blood, although hemolysis labs neg. Four units
cross typed and matched in blood bank waiting but Hct remained
stable >72 hours but no BM so couldn't assess for melena. She
was discontinued aminocaproic acid and GI recommended tagged RBC
scan if pt rebleeds.

2. Elevated troponin- Pt small troponin leak with ST depressions
on ECG consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of anemia.
ECG changes now resolved and planned to transfuse as above and
medically manage with B-Blocker but hold on ASA due to bleeding
risk.

3. UTI- although asymptomatic and afebrile, pt is neutropenic
and was being treated more aggressively as neutropenic fever
with Cefepime 2g IV q8h day discontinued 2009-10-01 00:00:00 since UA clear. No
need for further antibiotic treatment was advised.

4. MDS-Pt cont declining ANC with otherwise stable cell lines.
Decline coincides with starting Cefepime and metoprolol although
leukopenia is no a major SE of these meds. Plan was to start pt
on thalidomide after discharge today and will need weekly
procrit and CBC checks by VNA.

5. Hypothyroidism-cont on outpatient dose levothyroxine

6. Oral thrush-appears to have resolved after using Nystatin S
and S.

7. LBP-likely due to MDS. Well controlled on percocet elixir
although pt not requiring greater than every 24 hours while in
hospital.
