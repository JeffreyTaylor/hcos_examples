HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old man with
history of recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder, anemia and questionable celiac sprue who presented
with weakness and pallor of 2005-12-17 00:00:00 weeks duration, followed by
decreased hematocrit and increased INR to the MICU.  In
2005-12-17 00:00:00 the patient had a high retrograde urethral
catheter placed for BCG for recurrent transitional cell
carcinoma in his right renal pelvis.  He had a right
nephrostomy tube placed in 2005-12-17 00:00:00.  He was treated every week;
his last treatment was approximately 2 weeks ago.  The day
after each treatment, the patient noticed rust colored urine
and frank blood in his urine for the subsequent 3-4 days.
Three to four weeks prior to admission, the patient has had
progressively worsening weakness and pallor.  Concurrently,
the patient had repeated episodes of diarrhea and lost
approximately 16 lbs in two weeks.  He did not experience any
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; he attributed his diarrhea
to celiac sprue aggravated by eating glutin containing foods.
After two weeks, the diarrhea resolved and the patient
regained some of his lost weight.  Shortly afterwards, he
began experiencing constipation and noticed that his stools
were black.  He denies any hematochezia, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting.  Since the patient thought his oral iron
therapy might be contributing this blackened stools,
approximately two weeks prior to this admission he stopped
taking oral iron that had been prescribed for his chronic
iron deficiency anemia.  The patient's fatigue persisted and
worsened progressively in the week prior to admission; he was
unable to climb up a flight of stairs due to exhaustion and
difficulty breathing.  Associated symptoms included dizziness
upon standing, increased bruising of his extremities, and
pallor of his face and extremities.  The patient has had no
prior personal or family history of a bleeding diathesis.  On
admission, the patient's wife found him lying on the ground
because of exhaustion and lightheadedness with facial pallor.
Upon admission to the Emergency Room, his vital signs were
blood pressure 80/33, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 14.
He received four units of packed red blood cells in the ER
since his hematocrit was found to be 10.  ABG showed PH 7.52,
PO2 106, PCO2 28.  The ABGs draw site blood for 15 minutes
despite pressure, his coags were PTT 150, PT 100, INR 69.
Lower extremity dopplers did not show evidence of DVT or
evidence of intravascular bleed.  The patient was transferred
to the MICU where he received 7 units of packed red blood
cells, Vitamin K 10 mg IV and one unit of FFP as well as
Keflex.  Abdominal and pelvis CT showed no evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed, no evidence of hydronephrosis or
perinephric fluid.  Additionally, the patient complained of
left leg soreness and progressive weakness since his catheter
placement in 2005-12-17 00:00:00.  The pain is located predominantly
along the lateral aspect of his left lower leg distal to his
knee; the pain is aggravated by movement and the weakness
makes it difficult for him to walk.  He does not feel any
numbness or paresthesias in his legs.  In the week prior to
admission, he developed swelling distal to his knee which
continued to persist.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder diagnosed in 2005-12-17 00:00:00, treated with cystoscopy and tumor
resection in 2005-12-17 00:00:00, BCG in 2005-12-17 00:00:00 times two courses, Interferon
in 2005-12-17 00:00:00, Mutamycin 2005-12-17 00:00:00.  In 2005-12-17 00:00:00, transitional cell
carcinoma found in right renal pelvis, treated with
intrapelvic alpha Interferon and BCG.  2) Disseminated BCG
infection in 2005-12-17 00:00:00 treated with Rifampin and Ciprofloxacin.
3) Celiac sprue, anti-endomesial antibody titer was 1:8 in
2005-12-17 00:00:00.  4) Anemia, thought to be due to iron
deficiency.  The patient has had no colonoscopy in the last
10 years.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer from the MICU, Iron Sulfate 325 mg
po tid, Valium 5 mg po q h.s. prn, Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid,
Protonix 40 mg po q day, Nystatin powder to toe Kaion Seghetti spaces
tid, Neuro-phos, Folate 1 mg po q day, Multivitamin one
tablet po q day, Tylenol 650 mg po q 6 hours prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Quit smoking approximately 10-12 years ago,
occasional ethanol.  The patient is married and lives with
his wife.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for fatigue, dizziness, recent
weight loss, negative for nitrites or diplopia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 99.2, blood
pressure 100/58, pulse 72, respirations 18, sats 90% on room
air.  General, alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
Skin, multiple ecchymoses on left lower extremity and left
arm.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclera, supple neck, no
lymphadenopathy. Pupils equal, reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  OP clear.  Mucus membranes
moist.  No LAD.  Cardiovascular, S1 and S2, regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, non
distended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities, pitting edema
in the left leg, no erythema or significantly increased
warmth in left leg, mild pain on deep palpation of left
lateral leg, right lower extremity without any edema.  No
calf tenderness bilaterally.  Neuro, cranial nerves II
through XII intact.  Strength, 2005-12-17 00:00:00 in upper and lower
extremities.  Reflexes 2+ bilaterally.  Sensation intact
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit
29.8, MCV 86, reticulocyte count 2.1, platelet count 175,000.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GI:  The patient had EGD and colonoscopy which found no
source of bleed.  Small bowel follow through also did not
show any source of active bleeding.  The duodenal folds were
atrophic with lack of villi, edematous, consistent with
celiac sprue. Cold forceps biopsy was performed for
histology. There were grade 2 internal hemorrhoids in the
colon and polyp in the transverse colon which was removed.
Small bowel follow through was consistent with celiac
disease.  The patient was advised to follow a strict glutin
free diet along with supplementation of iron, Multivitamins
and Folic Acid.

2.  Heme:  The patient had MRI of his lower extremities which
showed chronic/subacute DVT in the right lower extremity that
had partially recanalized.  Hematology service did not think
that patient needs to be anticoagulated at this time since we
do not know etiology of his DVT.  Additionally, the
hematology team did not think that patient had a coagulopathy
because of rapid correction of his INR with just one unit of
FFP.  It seems likely that his elevated INR was likely
secondary to Vitamin K deficiency which was secondary to his
celiac disease.  The patient's iron deficiency anemia is also
likely secondary to his celiac disease.  Anti parietal
antibodies were sent for ruling out pernicious anemia.
Additionally, Vitamin B12 and Folate levels were pending at
the time of discharge.

3.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient's persistent left lower
extremity edema and tenderness would be secondary to
neuropathic vein which may have resulted from prolonged
positioning of his left lower extremity during placement of
his nephrostomy tube.  Doppler examination and MRI of the
left lower extremity showed no signs of DVT.

4.  Renal:  The patient's nephrostomy tube was removed by Dr.Kaion Seghetti team during the course of his stay in the hospital.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. Kaion Seghetti regarding further
management of his transitional cell carcinoma.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Celiac sprue.
2.  Anemia, likely secondary to iron deficiency.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  TUMS 500 mg po tid in between meals,
Vitamin D over the counter, Folate 1 mg po tid, Multivitamin
one po q day, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid times two days,
peri procedure prophylaxis for nephrostomy tube removal.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Discharged to home.  Patient
to follow-up with his PCP, Byler. Kaion Seghetti within one week and
Dr. Byler in neurology.
