Chief Complaint:
left hip pain 2009-10-13 00:00:00 protusion, failed left THR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left revision THR


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77F who had a primary left total hip replacement in
2009-10-13 00:00:00 by another surgeon that sustained progressive protrusio
early, ultimately failing with loss of fixation of the
acetabulum. I brought Deshaunta to surgery a little over a year ago
at which time we felt that her best treatment option
intraoperatively would be allograft packing of the acetabulum
defect and a
hemiarthroplasty head. Also considered at the time was a
Restoration GAP prosthesis. She did well for probably 10 or 12
months and then started developing pain and x-rays demonstrated
progressive protrusio with the femoral head at risk for pushing
through the remnant of the acetabulum. We have also seen
insufficiency fractures developing on the pubic ramus and in the
posterior wall of the acetabulum. The patient is developing
progressive pain, unrelenting, and sciatic symptoms. She has
been made nonweightbearing a couple
months ago in preparation for the surgery. She understands this
is very much a salvage operation. She is developing progressive
fracturing from osteoporosis and there is very little bone stock
remaining. She is really not a candidate
for major allograft pelvic reconstruction as fixation would be
limited. Best treatment course, cemented GAP cage and avoidance
of further allograft.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on 2009-10-13 00:00:00 and, later that day, was
taken to the operating room by Dr. Kamisha Patidar for revision left THR
without complication.  Please see operative report for details.
Postoperatively the patient did well.  She received 2upRBCs in
OR and then 2upRBCs in PACU.  The patient was initially treated
with a PCA followed by PO pain medications on POD#1.  The
patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively, as
well as lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The drain was removed without incident on POD#1. The
Foley catheter was removed without incident. The surgical
dressing was removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was
found to be clean, dry, and intact without erythema or purulent
drainage.

On POD3 patient developed nausea and vomiting with a WBC of 25.
Urine and blood cultures were negative.  CXR showed no evidence
of PNA.  An NGT was placed for peristent N/V and a distended
abdomen.  She was made NPO with maintenance IVFs.  Her
electrolytes were repleted.  Her urine output was closely
monitored.  A general surgery consult was placed for ?high grade
SBO (h/o splenectomy).  Patient was transferred to the SICU and
later received an abdominal CT which showed dilated loops with a
?transition point at the distal ileum c/w with an early low
grade SBO.  No evidence of perforation or diverticulitis.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for a DVT.  On POD4 her NGT output
decreased and she had a bowel movement.  Her neasea and abominal
pain resolved.  Bowel sounds returned.  She passed a clamping
trial and NGT was pulled on POD5, and later was transferred to
the floor.  On POD7 she was noted to have 1+ pitting edema in
BLE.  She was given 20mg PO lasix for likely mild vol overload.


While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was
stable, and the patient's pain was adequately controlled on a PO
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and
the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to home with
services or rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The patient's
weight-bearing status was touch down weight bearing of the LLE
with post hip precautions.
