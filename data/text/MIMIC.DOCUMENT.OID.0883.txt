Peripherally inserted central catheter insertion (PICC) 2009-09-21 00:00:00

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old Russian-speaking man with diastolic heart
failure, CKD, DM on insulin, asthma, atrial fibrillation (on
Coumadin), CAD (s/p CABG), h/o colon cancer, newly diagnosed
breast cancer (s/p biopsy 2 weeks ago), presenting with
abdominal distention, decreased urine output for the past two
weeks with urinary retention for the past two days.

His wife noticed increasing edema and abdominal girth
approximately 1 month ago. He saw his outpatient cardiologist
who increased his Torsemide dose from 100 to 150 mg PO daily.
Approximately 2 weeks ago, his wife again noticed increasing
abdominal girth and firmness as well, associated with decreasing
urine output. His cardiologist again increased his Torsemide
dose to 200 mg PO daily on week ago. His edema and decreased
urine output continued to progress, and he began to develop
scrotal edema. Two days prior to admission he was prescribed
metolazone 5 mg to be taken prior to dosing Torsemide. However,
he did not receive this medication. At this point he had urinary
retention, and his wife brought him to the emergency department.
Review of his medications from OMR revealed that he had been
prescribed Tamsulosin for BPH but he was not taking this
medication.

In the ED, initial VS T 97.5 HR 62 BP 99/49 RR 20 SaO2 96% on
RA. His creatinine was 2.6 which was an increase above his
baseline of 1.5-2. A Foley was placed, >600 mL of urine was
drained. A CXR showed vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
effusions left>right. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with
ventricular rate of 63, RBBB, LAFB, unchanged from prior EKG.
Bedside US showed bilateral pleural effusions. Abdominal U/S
showed free fluid and no hydronephrosis, but scrotal fluid. He
was not given diuretics initially because of his elevated
creatinine.

During admission to medicine service, he was given furosemide 40
mg IV with good response. However, on the following day, he
failed to respond to furosedmie 40mg IV, so the dose was
repeated. The following day, he also received furosedmie 40 mg
IV BID. His fluid balance was even over these two days. The next
day, he was given furosemide 80mg IV in the AM, 2.5 mg
metolazone followed by furosemide 100mg IV in the late
afternoon. In the evening, he triggered for worsening shortness
of breath. He was given metolazone 5 mg with furosemide 140 mg
IV around 11pm. He was also given his nebulizers and one dose of
Solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation. His O2 sats remained
>95% on 2009-09-21 00:00:00 L/min O2. His CXR at that time showed bilateral
plueral effusions and vascular congestion. His net fluid balance
was negative 200 cc that day. Of note he also had two episodes
of hypoglycemia to 40s overnight accompanied by tachypnea and
wheezing; his respiratory symptoms resolved with euglycemia. His
dose of insulin had been decreased earlier that day because of
decreasing PO intake. His symptoms and hypoglycemia resolved
with dextrose. His insulin was further decreased to NPH 10 units
QAM and 5 units QPM with sliding scale. In the morning, he again
triggered for RR >30 and cardiology was consulted. Patient was
transferred to cardiology service for further management.

ECG 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
Artifact is present. Atrial fibrillation with a controlled
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block with left anterior fascicular block. There are small R
waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing
of 2009-09-21 00:00:00 there is no significant change.

CXR 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart
size is moderately enlarged but appears similar compared to the
prior study. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with
perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness as well as
moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions. Patchy
opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive
atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute
osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with small
right, and moderate-sized left, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.

Renal Ultrasound 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
The right kidney measured 10.5 cm. The left kidney measured 11.5
cm. Both kidneys show cortical thinning. No hydronephrosis,
stones or massesis are observed. The bladder is not distended
with indwelling catheter within it.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral renal cortex thinning. No signs of
hydronephrosis.

Echocardiogram 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
The left atrium and the right atrium are moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta and the aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe pulmonary artery
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free
wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
2009-09-21 00:00:00, the findings are similar (prior study image quality
was superior). These findings are suggestive of a chronic
pulmonary process, e.g., PPH, chronic pulmonary embolism, COPD,
OSA, etc.

Chest X-ray 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by slight improvement in
degree of pulmonary edema and associated decrease in right
pleural effusion, now small in size. Bibasilar opacities appear
similar to the prior study as well as a moderate left pleural
effusion.

1. Hemodynamic catheterization revealed the presence of
pulmonary arterial hypertension in the setting of moderately
elevated left venticular filling pressures. Right ventricular
filling pressure was mildly elevated in the setting of severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
2. Vasodilator test wtih inhaled nitric oxide revealed no
reversibility of the pulmonary hypertension.
3. Cardiac index was at the lower limit of normal.

Upper extremity U/S 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
Grayscale and Doppler sonAdebola Cramer of bilateral subclavian veins
were performed; normal and symmetric flow was observed.
Grayscale and Doppler sonAdebola Cramer of left internal jugular,
axillary, brachial, cephalic and basilic veins were performed.
There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation.

Chest, abdominal and pelvic CT 2009-09-21 00:00:00:
CT OF THORAX:
Prior median sternotomy noted. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, slightly larger on the right side. There is
associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior
basal segments of both the right and left lower lobes. More
confluent airspace opacity is seen radiating from the hila to
involve the posterior and apical segments of the right upper
lobe. The right middle lobe remains well aerated. Findings are
most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is
also seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with
less severe pulmonary edema. Satisfactory position of the
right-sided PICC line with the tip terminating in the lower SVC.
Dense calcification of the left coronary artery are seen. There
are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes.
There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region
likely representing the primary tumor.
CT OF ABDOMEN:
Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average
Hounsfield value of 100. Causes of this appearance include
hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, Wilson's disease and, most
likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug therapy. No focal
liver lesions are identified. The gallbladder outlines normally.
The spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is
made of a 17-mm low-attenuation focus in the lower pole of
spleen, which is incompletely characterized, but most likely
represents a hemangioma. Both kidneys demonstrate cortical
thinning; however, no focal lesions are identified. Both adrenal
glands are normal in size and appearance. There are no
pathologically enlarged upper abdominal. Abdominal aorta
demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
normal in characters and caliber
CT OF PELVIS:
The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic
portion of the urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate
is normal in size and demonstrates coarse calcifications. Normal
appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no
significant perivenous hematoma following right heart
catheterization. There were no enlarged inguinal or pelvic
sidewall lymph nodes. Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm
low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the anterior
aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass
is seen in the pancreatic tail at the s123 Any St. hilum ( 2:56).
Several other sub centimeter low attenuation foci are seen
adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57). Findings are in keeping
with multiple pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms and could be
further evaluated with MRCP.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are seen involving
the thoracolumbar spine. A 3-mm sclerotic focus in the right
ilium has the appearance of a benign bone island.
IMPRESSION:
1. Splenomegaly with low-attenuation lesions, incompletely
characterized, but by demographics likely representing a
hemangioma.
2. Malposition of the urethral catheter as described.
3. High attenuation liver parenchyma likely secondary to
amiodarone therapy.
4. No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
5. Airspace opacities and pleural effussions most in keeping
with pulmonary edema.
6. Cystic pancreatic lesions requiring further evaluation with
MRCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo M with diastolic CHF and pulmonary arterial hypertension,
CKD, diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy, asthma, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG 2009-09-21 00:00:00, remote H/O colon
cancer, new breast cancer s/p biopsy 2 weeks ago, presenting
with volume overload from a combination of right sided CHF and
acute on chronic kidney injury who is no longer responding to IV
:asix and was transferred to UPMCE for aggressive diuresis.

Patient was volume overloaded on admission, which was attributed
to his known left and right sided diastolic CHF (with moderate
RV hypokinesis). He was transferred to UPMCE for Lasix gtt after
attempted diuresis with bolus doses of IV Lasix were
unsuccessful.  Repeat echo was similar to prior showing severe
pulmonary arterial hypertension and resulting right sided heart
failure, with EF >60%. Right heart catheterization with inhaled
vasodilator testing was performed which showed elevated
pulmonary pressures that were not responsive to either 100% FiO2
or inhaled nitric oxide (PA 89/19/42). Thus, it was felt he
would likely not benefit from 123 Any St.hibitor therapy. Aggressive
diuresis was continued with improvement in his peripheral edema.
Course was further complicated by transient bradycardia which
resolved spontanously, acute on chronic renal failure and
anemia. Despite response to IV diuretics, the patient's
respiratory status continued to decline. CXR and CT scan of the
chest demonstrated bilateral pulmonary effusions. He was started
on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and
cefepime to complete a 7 day course. Interventional pulmonary
was consulted for potential thoracentesis, however they were
unable to find a pocket suitable for drainage on two occasions
despite use of ultrasound guidance. The patient's O2 requirement
increased to 6 L/min via shovel mask with saturations in the mid
90s.

When it became clear the patient was not responding to maximal
medical therapy, a conversation about goals of care was
initiated with the family who ultimately decided to make him
comfort measures only. Diuretics were discontinued, and the
patient was given PO morphine, hyoscyamine for secretions and
PRN Ativan. The plan was to transfer the patient to a hospice
facility closer to his home. A few hours prior to the scheduled
transfer, the patient's respirations became more labored. The
patient was then noted by nursing to be unresponsive. His
physician were called to bedside. After a few agonal breaths and
a few faintly audible heart sounds, the patient was documented
to have undetectable carotid pulses, pupils dilated to 5 mm
bilateral and non-responsive to light, no apparent respirations
by visualization and auscultation, no audible heart sounds, and
several minutes of asystole on the bedside monitor. The
patient's wife and daughter were present at his bedside. The
patient was pronounced deceased at 13:13 on 2009-09-21 00:00:00. Chief cause
of death was respiratory failure secondary to congestive heart
failure. Attempts to make contact with the patient's PCP were
unsuccessful. Family declined autopsy.
