2014-08-26 00:00:00 Abdominal CT:IMPRESSION: Wall thickening in the
descending and sigmoid colon, including
the rectum with mesenteric stranding consistent with colitis.
Interval
increase in large amount of free intra- abdominal and mesenteric
fluid.

2014-08-26 00:00:00 Renal Ultrasound :
CONCLUSION: No evidence of renal abnormalities. Large volume of
ascites
noted.

2014-08-26 00:00:00 Abdominal CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Increased size of bilateral simple pleural effusions with
increased
bibasilar dependent atelectatic changes.
2. Large volume abdominal pelvic ascites which appears grossly
stable.
3. Evaluation of bowel loops is limited by lack of IV and oral
contrast.
Given this limitation, there is no evidence for obstruction or
bowel
perforation.
4. Shrunken liver with nodular contour. Status post
cholecystectomy.
5. 4mm left pulmonary nodule. Per Fleichner society guidelines,
recommend
2014-08-26 00:00:00 month follow up chest CT if patient has risk factors for
pulmonary
malignancy.

2014-08-26 00:00:00 Abdominal CT:
IMPRESSION:
  1. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

2. Nodular, cirrhotic liver with no focal lesions on this
single-phase study.
There is again moderate ascites, with large gastric varices.

3. Normal appearance of intra-abdominal loops of small and large
bowel. No
evidence for colitis or enteritis.

4. Diffuse superficial soft tissue induration, consistent with
cellulitis.
There is no air in the soft tissues to suggest a more aggressive
process such
as necrotizing fasciitis, although this cannot be excluded by
imaging.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Sabillon was admitted to the intensive care unit and
underwent vigorous fluid resuscitation and maintained on IV
Flagyl and PO Vancomycin.  He was seen by the infectious disease
service for further input in the treatment of his prolonged C
Diff colitis and they recommended continued treatment with
Flagyl and Vancomycin plus stopping any narcotics as he was at a
high risk of developing toxic megacolon.
His initial blood and urine cultures were negative and stool for
C Diff was positive.
His blood pressure improved with fluids and he did not require
any pressor support.
Vancomycin retention enemas were added for persistent diarrhea
and he underwent serial abdominal CT's to assess any colonic
changes. His abdominal exam over 3-4 days showed mild lower
abdominal tenderness and mild distention therefore continued
conservative non operative treatment with antibiotics was
planned.

Due to his prolonged period of poor nutrition/NPO,
hyperalimentation was started on 2014-08-26 00:00:00 and eventually he had a
PICC line placed in the left antecubital on 2014-08-26 00:00:00 for TPN and
antibiotics.

Of note, Mr. Sabillon platelet count gradually decreased since
his admission from 130K to a low of 49K. His HIT was negative
and SRA is still pending.  The hematology service was consulted
and felt that it was multifactorial including secondary to
cirrhosis, sepsis and anemia of chronic disease.  Heparin was
not contraindicated and over the course of his hospitalization
his platelet count gradually increased to the 90K range.

Transfer to the Sabillon floor occured on 2014-08-26 00:00:00 and Lasix was
started to try to help with fluid mobilization.  His PE showed
2014-08-26 00:00:00+ peripheral edema as well as scrotal edema and some ascites.
 He was treated with Lasix on a prn basis and his BUN/Cr
remained stable (22/0.5).

A superficial abdominal cellulitis was noted on 2014-08-26 00:00:00 beginning
on both flank areas and extending to the lower abdomen with no
connection to his sacral decubitus. He was started on broad
coverage antibiotics including Vancomycin and Zosyn without
improvement.  He was subsequently changed to Daptomycin,
Ciprofloxicin and Flagyl with some improvement.  Due to the
addition of broad spectrum antibiotics his oral Vancomycin was
increased to QID.  He had no evidence of diarrhea and no change
in his abdominal exam. Recommendations from the infectious
disease service recommends cipro/flagyl/ dapto until 2014-08-26 00:00:00 (10
days total).

Pt c diff colitis has responded well to PO vanco. Pt will
continue on 125 UPMCE until 2014-08-26 00:00:00 when Kristiann Wheelen 125 TIDx7d, 125
BIDx7d, 125 qdx7d, 125 qodx7d, 125 q3dx14d.

The Neurology service was consulted during this admission for
evaluation of his bilateral hand tremors which seemed a bit
worse.  Although Parkinson's disease could not be ruled out his
current situation precluded a definite assessment and they
recommended an out patient follow up with Dr.Jamayia.  His
Depakote continues at his home dose with a level of 53.

A speech and swallow evaluation was also done to assess the
ongoing question od possible aspiration.  His baseline diet was
ground solids however over the last week he was tolerating
nectar thick liquids and pureed with no evidense of aspirating.
He remains on TPN while his diet is being slowly advanced.
Continue on nector thickness liquids and TPN until cleared to
advance, with one to one supervision.

Mr Jamayia Sabillon also impaired skin integrity on his R buttocks first
seen 2014-08-26 00:00:00

2014-08-26 00:00:00 Assessment by 2014-08-26 00:00:00 nurse 2014-08-26 00:00:00: Sacral/coccygeal
unstageable pressure ulcer that is a DTI. Ulcer has evidence of
healing with necrotic area measuring 2 cm x 1 cm but affected
area measures 5 x 2 with ulcer on (R) buttock of 1 cm and more
linear ulcers on (L).Drainage is sero sang moderate amount. ALSO
there are superficial erosions on soft tissue of buttocks that
are caused by moisture and fungal rash.The area causes pain. ID
