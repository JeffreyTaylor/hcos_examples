Pertinent Results:
2012-04-17 00:00:00 Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 2012-04-17 00:00:00.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
There is a prosthetic tissue valve in the aortic position with
no AI and no leak. Residual mean gradient = 15 mmHg.
Trace MR. Airalyn Naylor.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on 2012-04-17 00:00:00 where
he underwent Aortic Valve Replacement with Dr. Janeliz Banigan. Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically Naylor
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He
developed a lactic acidosis with lactate peaking at 7.8.  The
patient remained asymptomatic and lactate trended to normal.  It
is attributed to anti-retroviral therapy.  The situation was
discussed with the patient's PCP, Naylor. Naylor.

The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical
Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.
on 2012-04-17 00:00:00 he was noted to have some erythema and possible bruising
of the right anterolateral calf.  There was no edema,swelling or
sensorymotor deficit. The patient stated this was present since
the day after his catheterization and he had banged his leg
against the side rail of the bed.  This was observed over
several days and on 2012-04-17 00:00:00 he had elebated compartment pressures
and was taken by Orthopedics to the Operating Room for anterior
compartment fasciotomy.

The wound remained clean and on 2012-04-17 00:00:00 he returned to the
operating Room for closure. This was accomplished uneventfully.

By the time of discharge on POD 12 the patient was ambulating
with the splint in place and a walker, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
