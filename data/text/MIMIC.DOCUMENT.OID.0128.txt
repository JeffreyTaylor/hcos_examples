Pertinent Radiology:
2010-12-01 00:00:00 Liver Gallbladder US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple hepatic masses, the largest of which measures over 4
cm, and is suspicious for metastatic disease given the history.
2. Unchanged severe right hydronephrosis.
3. No gallbladder distention or CBD dilation.

2010-12-01 00:00:00 CT ABD/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked progression of metastatic disease, with new metastases
in the liver as well as iliac and sacral bones.
2. Severe right hydroureteronephrosis, as in the prior study.
3. Limited evaluation of the central abdomen due to marked
streak artifact
from numerous surgical clips.
4. Bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis, as well as
incompletely
imaged nodular opacities suspicious for metastatic disease given
the history.

2010-12-01 00:00:00 CT HEAD:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. If there
is high
clinical suspicion for metastatic disease, MRI is more
sensitive.

2010-12-01 00:00:00 LENI:
IMPRESSION: Normal examination of the bilateral lower
extremities. No
evidence of DVT.

2010-12-01 00:00:00 CXR:
Since 2010-12-01 00:00:00, cardiomegaly is unchanged. Prior
sternotomy and
abdominal clips are unchanged.
Bilateral small pleural effusions are new. Bilateral increase in
interstitial markings and hilar haziness are consistent with
pulmonary edema. More confluent left lower lobe opacity could be
due to pneumonia.
Incidentally, old left rib fractures are unchanged.

2010-12-01 00:00:00 EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2010-12-01 00:00:00 no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 67 y.o male with h.o bladder cancer now presenting
with altered mental status and tachycardia.
.
MICU COURSE:
1) Tachycardia: patient presented with Afib. No obvious
explanation. Assess for myocardial infarction. With
thrombocytopenia and prolonged INR and renal failure, a PE is
less likely. Would check A-a gradient on room air and obtain
LENI's with peripheral edema. Also check thyroid function.
-monitor on tele
-ROMI
.
2) Fever with neutropenia: concern about infection with
neutropenia. CXR not impressive for infiltrate but there may be
slight increase in markings at right base and left base. On
broad spectrum antibiotics; will repeat CXR in AM. Blood
cultures pending/urine cx pending.
-neutropenic percautions.
.
3) Anemia: probably related to marrow suppression. No evidence
of GI bleeding. Guaiac stool. PIVs. IRON studies.
.
4) Thrombocytopenia: likely related to bone marrow suppression.
No evidence of bleeding now. Continue to monitor. Consider HIT
ab.
.
5) Hypotension: patient with hx of hypertension. Present BP
likely relatively hypotensive now. Has dry mucus membranes and
decreased tissue turgor. Will give additional fluids now. With
renal failure, would watch bicarbonate with normal saline fluid
resuscitation. Would not give lactated ringers because of
anuria. 2010-12-01 00:00:00 need D5W with bicarb as part of fluid resuscitation
if serum bicarb begins to drop.
.
6) Metastatic bladder ca: discuss future therapy with oncology.
.
7) Altered mental status: ETiologies include intracranial
mass/bleed but r/o with CT head. Other possibilities include
toxic-metabolic including uremia/acute liver failure. Other
possibilities include infection such as sepsis/meningitis. Other
possibility includes medication/narcotic effect. Patient given
narcan with some improvement. He is on narcotics at home and may
have taken extra doses or may now have delayed metabolism
because of liver 2010-12-01 00:00:00 and abnormal LFT's. Continue with narcan
for now. Uremia may also be contributing to altered mental
status.
-toxic metabolic w/u and correction
-frequent neuro exams
-antibiotics
-infectious w/u
-consult renal for HD.
.
8) Chronic renal failure: electrolytes and acid-base status
acceptable. Mental status may be due, in part, to uremia. No
volume overload now. No immediate need for dialysis. renal on
board.
.
9) Acidosis: combined anion gap acidosis, probably from uremia,
and metabolic alkalosis, likely from volume de123 Any St.n and
vomiting.

-Bili mostly direct (2.7 out of 3.8)
- Given now widespread 2010-12-01 00:00:00 on CT abd/pelvis. Family met with
Dr. Grewell (heme), Kronos Schnader (renal) and has decided to make pt
DNR/ DNI. Will most likely go to comfort care but would like to
wait a few days and see if the pt "comes out of this" ie change
in MS
- EKG without change
-FFP 4u given in afternoon
-Pt with very limited access. Currently has 1 working PIV.
Family not opposed to central access at this time but as it will
excalate care at this time with risks of infxn and coagulopathy,
will not place.
-Pt with A fib and HR into 180's off and on in the afternoon.
Started on Metoprolol 5IV Q 4hrs but still with intermittent
tachycardia. Currently in sinus.
- LENI's negative
-Stools grossly bloody and guaiac +. Hct stable.
-CE trending down
-Considered starting lactulose to possibly improve MS Jordell Grewell
to liver and liver damage seen in coagulopathy but d/c'd as pt
already having considerable diarrhea- C diff pending
-Per renal, if family still wishes, will do HD in am
-Got just 1L IVF bolus during evening. O2 Sat 95% on 2LNC and pt
putting out little uring by ostomy (must be cathed by nursing)

2010-12-01 00:00:00
- Family discussion -> decided to proceed with HD - bedside HD
per renal yesterday
- transfused 2 U with appropriate increase in Hct
- Urine Cx with GNR >100K
- Patient with pain in abd last night, given small dose morphine
with good effect

2010-12-01 00:00:00
- Pt made CMO overnight.
- Pt given IVF and Morphine PRN
.
OMED COURSE
Patient was transferred to OMED service from UPMCE on Thursday
2010-12-01 00:00:00.  At the time of transfer the goals of care were comfort
measures only.  He was kept on a morphine drip, titrated to
respiratory comfort.  He was also started on Ativan prn for
agitation.  Palliative care consult was obtained.  He passed
away on the night of Friday 2010-12-01 00:00:00 at approximately 6:15 PM.
Immediate cause of death was respiratory failure.  Secondary
cause of death was metastatic bladder cancer.
