History of Present Illness:
CC:test@mail.com.
HPI: 39 yo M w h/o G6PD deficiency, DM2, s/p ORIF (intubated
during procedure) for R patella fx. Post-surgical course
complicated by 02 desat to the 80's on RA and post-op pain.  Pt.
required 6L FM 02 to incr. sats to the 90's. Additionally, EKG
showed diffuse ST depressions and TWI.  Pt. was transferred to
the UPMCE for observation and management of hypoxia. The pt. had
an epidural placed for pain control which has now been d/c'd. He
is now transferred to UPMCE for further workup of EKG changes and
possible cardiac catheterization.  He denies any chest pain or
SOB during this hospitalization.
.
ROS: Pt. denies headaches, SOB, CP(although he does describe a
few episodes of chest pain with excercise and at rest in the
past). Denies N/V, denies diarrhea, admits to constipation and
reflux as inpatient.

.
IMAGING:
CXR: bilateral airspace disease (R>L) c/w pulm edema vs.
aspiration
.
XRAY RIGHT KNEE, THREE VIEWS 2012-11-26 00:00:00: There is a transverse
fracture through the lower third of the patella with
approximately 2.3 cm of distraction. There are several adjacent
bony fragments. A large knee effusion is present. Bony
mineralization is normal. No radiopaque foreign bodies are
identified. There is diffuse generalized edema in the
surrounding soft tissues. The distal femur and proximal tibia
are intact. The alignment of the knee is preserved.

IMPRESSION: Transverse fracture of the right patella as above.
.
Right LE Duplex, 2012-11-26 00:00:00:
Limited study.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the

right common femoral, proximal superficial femoral and calf
veins.
.
ECHO, 2012-11-26 00:00:00:
The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.
.
Cardiac cath, 2012-11-26 00:00:00:.
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LAD,
LCX, and
RCA were patent without disease. The LMCA had 20% ostial
stenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics demonstrated LVEDP of 13mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo M w h/o G6PD deficiency, DM2, s/p ORIF (intubated during
procedure) for R patella fx. Post-surgical course complicated by
02 desat to the 80's on RA and post-op pain with EKG changes.

MICU course:
**Enzymes consistently negative.  Cards to do cardiac
catheterization for concern for left main disease.  Of note
t-wave abnormalities persisted throughout his stay in the unit.
Patient was started on aspirin, lipitor, acei, and beta-blocker.

**Patient had low-grade fever that orthopedics attributed to
knee operation.  Patinet was kept on Cefazolin per orthopedics.
**Hematology consulted regarding the safety of asa and G6PD
deficiency.  They felt that it was OK to give a trial of the ASA
and then assess.  HCT was stable.
**Elevated creatinine was attributed to large muscle mass and
not believed to be due to any pathologic process in the setting
of a normal GFR.
**Oxygen requirement decreased during his stay and it was not
believed to have had a PE given the short surgery and clinical
improvement.
.
Hospital Course:
#) Hypoxia: The patient desatted to the 80's on RA and required
6L 02 after surgery.  His O2 requirement gradually decreased and
eventually was 100% 02 sat on RA. Chest xray showed mild pulm.
edema and elevated left hemi-diaphragm.  His O2 requirement was
thought initially to be 2012-11-26 00:00:00 oversedation from pain medications
in the post-operative setting along with history of obstructive
sleep apnea.  His O2 requirement improved quickly and PE was not
thought to be likely.
.
#) EKG changes: The patient's EKG showed diffuse fixed 1mm ST
elevations and TWI that persisted on followup EKGs. However, it
was unclear whether these changes are new (no EKGs on record in
our records or UPMCE).  The patient has been asymptomatic and
denies any chest pain or SOB. He does report mild chest pain a
few weeks back while excercising and at rest.  He was monitored
on telemetry and seen by the cardiology consult who felt his EKG
findings were concerning for possible left main disease.  He was
transferred to the cardiology service for cardiac
catheterization.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were
negative, and he was monitored on telemetry.  He was started on
an aspirin, BB, statin, and ACEI during his hospitalization and
continued upon discharge.  His cardiac cath showed no evidence
of coronary disease but concern for possible compression of the
left main root, possibly anomalous coronary anatomy.  He was
scheduled for an outpatient cardiac MRI to further evaluate this
possibility and follow up in cardiology clinic.
.
#) Elevated Creatinine: The patient was admitted with a Cr of
1.6. Records obtained from UPMCE show his baseline crt. is 1.5.
His calculated CrCl was normal and the elevated Cr was thought
to be 2012-11-26 00:00:00 the patient's large muscle mass.
.
#) HTN: The patient had no history of documented HTN. However,
the patient had SBP in the 160's while at UPMCE.  He was started
on a BB and ACEI given his EKG changes and concern for cardiac
disease.
.
#) Type II DM: The patient's outpatient oral hypoglycemics were
stopped upon admission and he was maintained on an insulin
sliding scale.  He was briefly put on Glargine for control of
elevated blood sugars but this was discontinued before his
discharge.
.
#) Fevers: The patient had fevers to 101 in the post-operative
period.  His fever curve trended down.  Blood and urine cultures
were negative.  A chest xray showed evidence of atelectasis and
the patient was encouraged to continue incentive spirometry.  A
right lower extremity Duplex was negative for DVT.  He was
continued on Cefazolin per recommendations of the orthopedic
service.  This was discontinued and the patient had no further
fevers.
.
#) s/p ORIF of left patellar fracture: The patient was followed
by the orthopedic surgery service.  He was fitted with a brace
for the right leg and was scheduled for followup in 2 weeks with
orthopedics for further adjustment of the brace.  He was given a
short course of pain medication for his right knee pain after
surgery and he will followup with orthopedics in 2 weeks.
.
#) G6PD deficiency: Stable during this hospitalization.  Sulfa
drugs were avoided, as were dietary triggers.
Hematology/oncology was called before starting aspirin but they
felt that the patient had a low likelihood of hemolysis with
aspirin.  The patient was started on aspirin and monitored for
signs and lab evidence of hemolysis.  His hematocrit was stable
and he tolerated the aspirin well.  He was continued on an
aspirin as an outpatient.
.
#) FEN: Cardiac heart-healthy, G6PD deficiency diet
