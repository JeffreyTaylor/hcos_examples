Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2006-11-27 00:00:00 Aortic Valve Replacement utilizing a 27mm CE Perimount
Pericardial Tissue Valve


History of Present Illness:
This is a 48 year old male who was admitted to outside hospital
after syncopal episode. Noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation
at that time and converted back to a normal sinus rhythm with
Lopressor and intravenous Cardizem. Echocardiogram revealed
bicuspid aortic valve with severe critical aortic stenosis. The
aortic valve area was estimated at 0.6cm2. His left ventricular
ejection fraction was 55-60%. Cardiac catheterization on 2006-11-27 00:00:00 confirmed severe aortic stenosis. Coronary angiography
revealed clean coronary arteries. Based on the above results, he
was transferred to the UPMCE for cardiac surgical intervention.

Aortic Stenosis, Childhood Heart Murmur, History of Atrial
Fibrillation, History of Migraine Headaches, Horseshoe Kidney

Denies tobacco and excessive ETOH. Married with children. Works
in construction. Currently lives with his wife.

Uncle died suddenly at young age(before 55).

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pneumothorax and atx

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
48 year old man s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pneumothorax and atx
INDICATION: 48-year-old man status post aortic valve
replacement.

PA and lateral chest x-ray dated 2006-11-27 00:00:00 is compared to the
prior from yesterday. The patient is status post median
sternotomy. The aortic valve has been replaced. There is stable
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left lower lobe
atelectasis and pleural effusion. There is no evidence for
congestive heart failure or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Stable elevation of left hemidiaphragm with a small
left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.
2. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. The aortic valve is
bicuspid. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
3. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aorticl
position with
normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 13 mmHg).
No perivalvular
leak is seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Regional and global biventricular systolic function are
normal.
3. No aortic dissection is seen post decannulation.
4. Rest of study is unchanged from pre-bypass study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Roane was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. An echocardiogram confirmed a bicuspid aortic valve
with severe aortic stenosis. A carotid ultrasound showed normal
internal carotid arteries. He was cleared by the dental service
after bedside and radiographic examinations. He otherwise
remained stable on medical therapy and was cleared for surgery.
No further episodes of atrial fibrillation were noted on
telemetry after cardioversion. On 2006-11-27 00:00:00, Dr. Roane
performed an aortic valve replacement. Surgery was uncomplicated
and he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. For
further surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative
note. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. Low dose beta blockade was resumed
and Amiodarone was initiated for ventricular ectopy. He
otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the
SDU on postoperative day one. He was gently diuresed and
physical therapy initiated.  He continued to progress without
complications and was discharged home on post operative day 5 in
good condition with VNA services.
