Pertinent Results:
CTA head 2010-04-18 00:00:00
CT angiography of the head demonstrates an
approximately 3.5 mm aneurysm arising from the anterior
communicating artery at the junction of the right A1 and A2
segments and pointing to the left side. No other definite
aneurysms are identified in the arteries of anterior and
posterior circulation.

IMPRESSION:
1. CT head demonstrates subarachnoid and intraventricular blood
and signs of early obstructive hydrocephalus.
2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates a 3.5 mm aneurysm
from the
anterior communicating artery at the junction of the right A1
and A2 segment and pointing to the left side. No other aneurysms
are seen in the head.
3. CT angiography of the neck demonstrates no vascular occlusion
or stenosis.

CT Head 2010-04-18 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post coiling of ACOM aneurysm. Stable amount of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage with interval redistribution. Minimal interval
increase in the
left lateral ventricle IVH.
2. Diffuse sulcal effacement, as before, likely secondary to
mild global
edema.
3. No new hemorrhage.

ECHO 2010-04-18 00:00:00:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CTA Head 2010-04-18 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:

1. Status post coiling of anterior communicating artery aneurysm
with
decreased subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage since the
prior exam.  No new hemorrhage or obvious infarction. Cerebral
edema has improved since the prior exam. A small hypodense focus
in the right frontal lobe laterally may relate to volume
averaging or less likely a focus of ischemic change and needs
attention on f/u.
2. No flow limiting stenosis or obvious vasospasm or new large
aneurysm.
3. Right distal cervical ICA is tortuous, of uncertain
significance. Given
young age and lack of atherosclerotic disease, clinical
correlation for
connective tissue/ vascular disorders is suggested.

 ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT Study Date of 2010-04-18 00:00:00 7:36
AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate ascites within the abdomen.
2. No focal liver lesion and no biliary dilatation.
3. Splenomegaly.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of 2010-04-18 00:00:00 3:31 AM

FINDINGS: As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, there is
unchanged position
of the right PICC line. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
However, the
increased vascular diameter and slightly increased diameter of
the right
paramediastinal vessels suggest newly appeared moderate
pulmonary edema.

The observation was made at the time of dictation, 8:34 a.m., on
2010-04-18 00:00:00. At that time, the referring physician was paged for
notification.
Findings were subsequently discussed over the telephone.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Simson was admitted to the NICU. CTA was done that
redemonstrated SAH and suggested R ACOMM aneurysm. She was
started on nimodipine and Keppra with Q1 hr neuro checks while
in the ICU. She underwent an angio with coiling. She remained
intubated post-op secondary to delayed reversal. She was
angiosealed to the R side. She was extubated Saturday evening
but then required reintubation for hypoxia on 2010-04-18 00:00:00.

On 2010-04-18 00:00:00 she was hypotensive and Nimodipine was held. TCDs on
2010-04-18 00:00:00 were normal and her SBP normalized and she restarted
Nimodipine. Patient expressed her wishes and declared herself
DNI.

On 2010-04-18 00:00:00, she appeared more confused in the AM. A CTA head was
done which showed no vasospasm. No changes were made to her
management. A UA/UC was sent, UA was negative. We also checked
her liver enzymes which appeared improved since admission.

On 2010-04-18 00:00:00, Transcranial dopplers revealed no vasospasm.  She
continued to be observed. Hepatology saw her for moderate acites
on US. They recommended lactulose, aldactone and lasix. The
patient continues to exerience to have tachypnea.

2010-04-18 00:00:00: Hepatology performed diagnostic paracentesis (40cc) which
the patient refused half way through the procedure that was
negative for infection, given 100g albumin. Pt made Care and
comfort measures only per her and family wishes
TCD showed no overt spasm.   Hepatology reccommende starting
lactulose, lasix and aldactone; increasing abdominal distention
overnight, pancultured  complained of SOB and was given lasix
for a urine output of 50-60ml/hr.  The patients hyperkalemia
worsened and so insulin/D50 was given along with kayexylate.
nephrology consulted and recommended giving 80mg lasix and
patient did not respond, so an additional 160mg of lasix was
given. Dialysis not an option as informed by mother (health care
proxy) that patient would never want to be dialyzed. Ultimately,
family decided for CMO for patient.  The patient experienced
respiratory ditress overnight, tachypnea and was on a morphine
gtt for comfort.  Due to respiratory distress the patient
wxpired at 0941 on 2010-04-18 00:00:00.
