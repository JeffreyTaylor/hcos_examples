PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a 90% proximal
LAD
stenosis with TIMI II flow distally. We decided to treat this
lesion
with direct stenting. Integrillin was given prophylactically. A
8 French
XBLAD 3.5 guide provided excellent support. The lesion was
crossed with
a BMW wire without difficulty. A 2.75x23 mm Cypher DES was
deployed at
14 atms. The stent was postdilated with a 3.0x18 mm NC ranger
baloon
inflated at 14 atms twice. Subsequent angiography revealed
compromise of
the ostium of a moderate size diagonal and we decided to rescue
it with
baloon PTCA. An ACE 2.0 baloon was advanced into the diagonal
and was
inflated to 10 atms and then to 14 atms. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis in the stented LAD, no dissection and TIMI III
flow.
The origin of the diagonal had a 30% resdiual stenosis. The
patient left
the lab pain free and in stable condition

ECHO 2014-09-07 00:00:00:
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler
or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50
percent). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:
CAD:
This patient's cardiac catheterization was complicated by a
jailed diagonal artery.  He was chest pain free throughout his
postcath course, however.  His medical regimen for secondary
prevention of acute coronary syndrome was maximized.

AF:
He did have an episode of tachycardia that was felt to be likely
atrial fibrillation, and he was started on anticoagulation with
coumadin.

Oxygen step up:  He had a follow up echo which showed no ASD.

Hematuria and Urinary retention:
He had an episode of hematuria associated with foley placement
which cleared with irrigation.  He also had an episode of
urinary retention for which he was seen by urology.  He was sent
home with a leg bag for foley drainage and was scheduled for a
voiding trial as an outpatient.

Myasthenia Runco:
He was maintained on his home myasthenia regimen.
