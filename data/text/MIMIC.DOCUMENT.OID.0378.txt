2011-11-16 00:00:00: BCX ngtd

IMAGING:
2011-11-16 00:00:00 CXR: The lungs are well expanded and clear. The
mediastinum is
unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for
size. No
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The visualized osseous
structures are
unremarkable.

2011-11-16 00:00:00 EKG: Sinus rhythm. Diffuse low voltage. Compared to the
123 Any St.us tracing of 2011-11-16 00:00:00 the rate has decreased. The atrial
morphology has changed, no longer reflecting right atrial
abnormality. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Xayavong is a 50 yo F with diabetes mellitus on insulin pump
who was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis felt to be most
probably related to a viral gastroenteritis.

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis:
Patient was initially admitted to the intensive care unit with
anion gap acidosis, urinary ketones, and with volume de123 Any St.n
as well as lactic acidosis. Aside from leukocytosis, initial
infectious work up was unremarkable and ECG showed no signs of
acute coronary event. Patient denied recent changes in insulin
or medications and it was felt that DKA was triggered by a viral
gastroenteritis.  Patient was started on IV insulin drip until
glucose decreased to less than 200 and anion gap began to close.
 Lactate levels fell from 4.6 to 2.5. When blood glucose was
165, so was started on 5% dextrose w/0.45% NS at 200cc/hr. Her
blood glucose was monitored with q1-2 fingersticks. She received
total of ~5L of IVF in ED/MICU. Pt began tolerating regular
diet, gap closed, and so insulin drip and IVF were discontinued.
Xayavong was consulted and recommended starting patient back on
her home insulin pump as patient was tolerating diet without
nausea/vomiting. She will be followed by Xayavong after her
discharge.

# Leukocytosis:  She presented with WBC 18 and T=100.4F in the
ED with Tmax on floor 100.6F.  It was thought to be secondary to
DKA related inflammatory response and likely viral
gastoenteritis as her blood cultures and CXR were negative.  She
had no other focal signs of infection. Her GI symptoms improved
in the hospital and she was able to tolerate her diabetic diet
well.  Her leukocytosis resolved with hydration alone.

# Dehydration: On admission, she appeared dehydrated with dry
mucous membranes, likely from nausea and vomiting in conjuction
with osmotic diuresis secondary to hyperglycemia.  Her
creatinine was originally up to 1.1, but resolved after fluid
resuscitation.

# Anemia:  Pt's admission Hct 38.3-->31.7.  Most likely
dilutional drop, as no apparent sources of bleed. Looking back
on records, her baseline hct is around 32. 2011-11-16 00:00:00 consider iron
studies and other anemia work up as an outpatient.

# Hypertension: As patient was dehydrated and her blood pressure
was normal, home lisinopril was held in the hospital. She was
instructed to restart her lisinopril at 20 mg daily at the time
of discharge, and to uptitrate it as instructed by her PCP.

Transitional Issues:
[ ] Follow up with Xayavong for management of IDDM
[ ] Blood pressure check at next visit and increase lisinopril
back to 40 mg daily if needed
[ ] Consider work up for anemia
[ ] Consider repeat echocardiogram to eval for mitral
regurgitation

Medications on Admission:
Lisinopril 40 mg PO daily
ASA 325 daily
INSULIN PUMP
Vit D/Ca daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Xayavong,
it was a pleasure to take care of you at UPMCE. You were admitted because of high blood sugars
and diabetic ketoacidosis. You were started on insulin drip and
admitted to ICU for close monitoring of your electrolytes and
blood sugar. Your sugars improved with insulin drip and you were
able to transition back to your insulin pump when you could
start eating again. Your nausea and vomiting resolved.

Please continue to monitor your blood sugars closely at home.
Please keep the Xayavong and PCP appointments made for you. If you
cannot make them, please call the office and reschedule the
appointments.

Your Lisinopril was stopped in the hospital because your blood
pressure was low. Please change your lisinopril dose to 20 mg
daily (half a tablet of 40 mg) until you see Dr. Xayavong on 2011-11-16 00:00:00, and take it as instructed afterwards.

You are taking full dose aspirin at this time. We do recommend
that you take baby aspirin (81 mg daily) to decrease the risk of
bleeding. Please discuss this further with your primary care
physician.
