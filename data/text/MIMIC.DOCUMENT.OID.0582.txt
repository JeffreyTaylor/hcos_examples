Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
This is a 80-year old F with recent mechanical fall complicated
by L humerus fracture who presented for this admission with a
repeat mechanical fall complicated by head laceration and
seizure, without intacranial abnormality on imaging, seizure
thought to be secondary to head trauma, remaining
hemodynamically stable
.
ACTIVE
# Status Post Fall: Patient presented in the setting two falls;
first fall (1wk prior to presentation) she broke her L humerus
and was managed conservatively as an outpatient; second fall she
incurred a head laceration; reported it as a mechanical fall
without LOC; in ED she had seizure (as described below) and was
initially admitted to ICU; CT unremarkable, MRI only w thickened
falx cerebri; L humeral fracture conservative management was
continued.  Laceration was initially complicated by heavy
bleeding; patient had INR reversed, required 2 units pRBCs, and
wound stabilized.  Patient was evaluated by PT/OT who
recommended rehab.  Patient remained hemodynamically stable.

# s/p Seizure: As above, patient with tonic/clonic seizure in
setting of head trauma; CT unremarkable, MRI only w thickened
falx cerebri; patient was evaluated by neurology who felt that
seizure was most likely 2011-08-06 00:00:00 trauma and there was no indication
for anti-epileptic indication.  Thickened radiology recommended
re-evaluation of falx cerebri in future.
.
# Afib: Coumadin initially held in setting of heavy bleeding.
Given two recent falls, inpatient team discussed with PCP
stopping the patient's coumadin.  PCP agreed and coumadin was
stopped.  Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm.  Metoprolol
was continued.
.
INACTIVE
# GERD: Continued continue prilosec.
.
# HTN: Continued HCTZ, diovan.
.
# HLD: Continued zetia.
.
TRANSITIONAL
1. Code status - Patient remained full code for duration of
hospitalization
2. Pending - No labs were pending at time of discharge
3. Transition of Care - Patient discharged to UPMCE Rehab for
further management with copy of discharge summary.  Case
discussed with PCP.  Bernon Lederer above, follow-up MRI head was
recommended to further evaluate thickening of falx cerebri

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Lederer--

It was a pleasure taking care of you at UPMCE.
You were admitted after falling and cutting your head.  During
your hospital stay you had a seizure.  You were evaluated by
medicine and neurology doctors.  CT and MRI of your head did not
show any signs of bleeding.  Your seizure was likely a result of
hitting your head, so you do not need to be on anti-seizure
medications.

Given your recent falls and bleeding, we spoke with your primary
care physician and stopped your coumadin.

During the course of your hospitalization, the following changes
were made to your medications:
-STOPPED coumadin
-STARTED percocet as need for pain
-STARTED bowel regimen
