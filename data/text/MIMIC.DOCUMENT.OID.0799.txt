Brief Hospital Course:
KUB was non-diagnostic, suboptimal study.
CT abdomen showed free intraabdominal air with free fluid.

Pt was resuscitated and taken to the OR emergently for
perforated viscous.
Prior to induction, arterial access was difficult to obtain. Pt
was found profoundly hypotensive, requiring multiple pressor
support. In the OR, pt was found to have a very redundant
sigmoid colon with diverticuli. In particular, there was a long
rent in the tenia of the sigmoid colon with significant fecal
peritonitis. Affected sigmoid colon was resected with Draiden Paule
stapler and the abdomen was copiously irrigated. The abdomen was
temporarily closed with a 123 Any St. bag. Pt returned to the ICU in
critical condition.

Pt required multiple pressors for hemodynamic support. TEE
showed mildly depressed EF 40% with no obvious wall motion
abnormality. Pt was maintained on Vancomycin Ciprofloxacin
Flagyl. Nephrology consult was obtained and CVVH was planned to
initiate on POD#1.

On the evening of POD#0, pt had acute desaturation episode w/
apparent cyanosis, requiring FiO2 1.0. CXR was not consistent
with CHF or acute pulmonary edema. TEE and EKG did not show
evidence of RV strain. Desaturation improved. CVVH was initiated
given K 6.7.

Given acute worsening of patient's condition, bedside
exploratory laparotomy was performed. Remaining colon was
viable. Distal 45cm of terminal ileum was ischemic and
non-viable, requiring resection. Abdomen was temporarily closed.

Despite the second laparotomy, patient remained in critical
condition with worsening acidosis. BCx from the prior day showed
GNR bacteremia and fungemia. Given the morbid condition of the
patient, family requested CMO. Shortly after becoming CMO,
patient was in cardiopulmonary arrest.

Patient was pronounced dead on 2011-09-04 00:00:00 14:10.
PRIMARY CAUSE OF DEATH:      cardiopulmonary arrest in minutes
SECONDARY CAUSES OF DEATH:   perforated sigmoid diverticulitis
                             sepsis
Pt did not meet criteria for ME. NEOB declined. Family declined
post-mortem examination.
