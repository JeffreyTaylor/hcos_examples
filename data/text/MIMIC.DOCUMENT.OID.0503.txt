Attending:Janelie Batory
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypotension

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69 y/o female with ESRD, bed bound, humeral and femoral
fracture who was recently admitted to ICU with enterobacter/
klebsiella/Pseudomonas UTI and bacteremia on Gent, Cefepime via
PICC who was admitted with increased change in mental status,
less responsive and fever x 1 day. Patient got HD on 2006-01-16 00:00:00
and when she came to the ED on 2006-01-16 00:00:00, her SBP was found to be in
the 80s. Patient got 1.5L NS and BP returned to SBP 120s. Her
lactate was 1.0. ID and renal consulted and ID recommended
continuing patient on meropenum, linezolid, and Gentamycin.
Patient got vancomycin in ED.
.
History obtained from son on Transfer, he states that pt was
discharged on saturday, sunday she felt weak and was somnolent.
After dialysis on monday she became more lethargic and
unresponsive and was transferred to UPMCE ED.  She got
"antibiotics" and IVF in ED and ICU and she became more
responsive.  In Chynia Lafon, pt remained afebrile and pressures
improved with IVF.  She was transferred to the regular floor for
further management.

Tagged WBC scan 2006-01-16 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Mild increased tracer activity in the distal portion
of left femur and left humerus likely consistent with either
mild infection or a healing fracture.

Femur XRAy:INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease with femur
fracture.  Two images of the left femur were compared to
2006-01-16 00:00:00.  There has been no significant change from
the 123 Any St.us study which includes a healing supracondylar
fracture that is impacted with some mild medial displacement.
The left hip joint appears unchanged with resorption of the
femoral neck without a demonstrable fracture line.  Per
discussion with nuclear medicine, the tagged white blood cell
study suggests osteomyelitis of the distal femur at the fracture
site.  On plain radiograph, there is no discrete evidence for
osteomyelitis but the significant diffuse osteopenia limits the
sensitivity of detection.

IMPRESSION:  Unchanged healing supracondylar fracture and marked
osteopenia

Humerus Xray (bilateral): Two images of the left humerus and two
images of the right humerus were reviewed.  There has been
increased angulation and further displacement of the left
comminuted distal periprosthetic humerus fracture.  Evaluation
for osteomyelitis is limited by diffuse osteopenia.  Given this
limitation, no signs of osteomyelitis are present.  The right
humerus appears normal apart from the significant osteopenia and
again, no signs of osteomyelitis are present.

CXR 2006-01-16 00:00:00: right after ?aspiration (labored breathing)
Compared with 2006-01-16 00:00:00 and allowing for differences in
positioning, there is probable mild cardiomegaly.  The aorta is
unfolded.  The superior mediastinal silhouette is prominent and
the trachea at the level of the neck may be narrowed.  There is
no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.  A dual lumenright- sided
catheter, dual lumen, is present.

CXR 2006-01-16 00:00:00 (1 day after ?aspiration):1.  Subsegmental
atelectasis, without other evidence for acute pulmonary process.
3.  Small pulmonary nodule at left base, of uncertain
significance.  This was not visible on prior x-rays and was not
described on the 2006-01-16 00:00:00 torso CT. Recommend attention to this
area on followup films.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o female with PMH notable for ESRD on HD present with
recent episodes of sepsis of unclear source.  Pt was originally
admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fevers,.  She quickly
responded to IVF and was pancultured and imaged.  She was stable
and thus transferred to the wards for further management and
diagnosis.  Her course was complicated by a period of AMS and
tachypnea to the 40s likely 123 Any St.ated by an aspiration event.
The spontaneously resolved after 2 days and was not
radiographically evident.  Of note, the patient aspirates all
but fluids per the last swallow evaluation.  However, the
patient clearly refused NG tube and feedign tube and she and her
family wish for her to eat.  She may require furhter evaluation,
but swallow eval had to be aborted at UPMCE due to vomiting
prior to evaluation.

1) Fever/Hypotension - Initial ddx includes sepsis vs. volume
de123 Any St.n at dialysis.  BP responeded to IVF.  She was started
on meropenum/linezolid in the ICU.  Quickly after presentation
pt was normotensive and was transferred to the floor.  AFter
blood cultures were negative for >48 hours, linezolid was
discontinued.  Per ID recs, pt underwent a tagged WBC scan to
see if there was another source of infection.  Repeat u/a and
culture were also sent.  Plastic surgery was consulted regarding
her decub wounds on the calfs, they did not recommend doing a
debridement.

*Patient does not make much urine, and her symptoms are likely
secondary from urinary tract infections -> urosepsis given poor
hygine.  Spoke with UPMCE rehab and family regarding the need
for good hygeine which may help with recurrent infections.

* Now ? whether multifocal osteomyleitis has incited these
multiple episodes of sepsis.  Treatment is medical -Continue to
treat with meropenem per ID x 1 week.

2) ?Osteo: See tagged wbc scan above.  Ortho consult suggests
that to definitively differentiate btw tumor and healing
fracture is MRI.  Given that she has no known right humeral fx,
this is likely osteo vs tumor.  Orthopedics deems pt poor
operative candidate this the treatment is medical; will not
pursue MRI at this time.  Continue meropenem x 1 week.

3) ESRD - Renal followed patient in house with TIW dialysis.

4) Diabetes - Continued outpatient regimine of glargine and
RISS.

5) History of PE - On coumadin 2mg qhs, INR subtherapeutic on
admission however last admission INR of 14.6 on 5 mg coumadin so
coumadin was increased gently to 3 mg qhs.  Will require
monitoring.

6) Anasarca/humeral fracture/bilateral calf decub ulcers -
Chronic issues in this essentially bed bound patient.  Unchanged
during this admission.  Please refer to 123 Any St.us discharge
summaries for 123 Any St.us workups. Continue wound care, plastics
will not debride.

7) FEN: Hypernatremia likely due to dialysis (dehydration); will
require free water orally versus IV to manage.  Nectar
prethickened liquids and purees for food (see page 1)
