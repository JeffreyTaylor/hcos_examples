HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 23-year-old
right-handed man with a history of angina, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolemia who suffered a large right middle
cerebral artery stroke and was admitted to Neurology and was
then transferred to the Medicine Service with flash pulmonary
edema complicated by post diuresis hypernatremia, aspiration
pneumonia, without return to baseline mental status.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to no likelihood of
improvement, the patient was made comfort measures only.
This was in agreement with the patient's family.  A morphine
drip was started.  Palliative Care was involved in making the
patient more comfortable.  In discussions with the family, it
was decided to give the patient no intravenous fluids and no
tube feeds.  The patient was comfortable in bed, and the
morphine drip was titrated to the patient's comfort.

I was called to pronounce the patient on 2007-12-15 00:00:00 at
16:30.  The patient was unresponsive with pupils fixed and
dilated.  There was no gag reflex and no corneal reflex.
There was no withdrawal to stimuli.  There were no breath
sounds or heart sounds.  I was able to communicate with the
patient's daughter, and her family did not want a postmortem
examination.  The attending, Dr. Cina Katzner, was notified.
