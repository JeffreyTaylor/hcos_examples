History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Freland Sarkisyan is a very nice 62 year-old woman with
significant past medical history of diabtes mellitus type 2,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABG who comes with three
weeks of shortness of breath and dyspnea on excertion. Patient
states that she is not very active at home given baseline
shortness of breath, which is thought to be secondarely to her
heart disease and COPD/Asthma, but she is able to do 1 flight of
stairs with difficulty. However, during the last 3 weeks she has
noted progressive SOB with less activity such as 10 steps. She
denies any nausea, vomit, cough, chest pain, palpitations,
wheezing associated with the SOB. She still uses either 1 or no
pillows at night and can lie flat without difficulty. She
weights herself daily and has been with diet to try to lose
wieght. There have been no sick contacts and she denies any
fever, chills, rigors, cough, rhinorrhea, arthralgias, muscle
pains, diarrhea, dysuria, urinary frequency. She went to see her
endocrinologist that follows her for her diabetes mellitus and
was asked to come to our emergency room. Her VS at that time
were: BP 167/71 mmHg, P 72 BPM, SpO2 O2 93% oN RA.
.
Per patient's report she had a stress test done in 2009-01-06 00:00:00 last
year, but could not walk for more than a couple of minutes.
There was no imaging done. She had not had a cardiac cath since
her CABG.
.
In the ER her initial VS were BP 163/61 mmHg, P63 BPM, RR 17,
94% on RA, T 98.4 F. She had an ECG that showed occasional PVCs
with LVH by Sokolow-Zaydrian Delaney cirteria with TWI in I, II avL and
V5-V6 as well as <1mm ST depression in I, II and V5-V6 without
any dynamic changes. Patient was admitted for ROMI.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Echo: 2009-01-06 00:00:00
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
and mid-inferior walls, as well as basal inferoseptal and
inferolateral segments (dominant RCA or LCx territory). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
.
2009-01-06 00:00:00- cardiac perfusion
IMPRESSION:
1. Fixed, medium sized, moderate reduction in photon counts
involving the PDA territory.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size. Hypokinesis of the mid
and basal
inferior wall and the basal inferoseptum with preserved systolic
function.
.
2009-01-06 00:00:00 - stress
This is a 62 year old IDDM woman s/p CABG, htn, COPD
who was referred for exercise stress with nuclear imaging
following
serial negative cardiac enzymes to evaluate symptoms of dyspnea
on
exertion. The patient completed 6.75 minutes of a modified Zaydrian Delaney
protocol and reached a peak MET capacity of 4.8 which represents
a fair
functional capacity for her age. The test was terminated due to
fatigue. There were no complaints of chest, neck, back, or arm
pain.
Compared to baseline ECG with prominent voltage consistent with
LVH and
associated repolarization changes, there were no significant ST
segment
changes ap123 Any St.ted. The rhythm was sinus throughout the study
with
multifocal PVCs and two ventricular couplets. Blood pressure
response to
exercise was appropriate. The heart rate response was blunted in
the
setting of beta blockade therapy.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or significant ST segment
changes over
baseline abnormalities at a fair functional capacity for age.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
.
2009-01-06 00:00:00
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post
median
sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
The
pulmonary vascularity is prominent, but there is no evidence of
overt
pulmonary edema. Linear opacities within both lung bases are
compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. No pleural effusion,
focal consolidation, or
pneumothorax is seen. The osseous structures demonstrate no
acute skeletal
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. Freland Sarkisyan is a 62 year-old woman with significant
past medical history of diabtes mellitus type 2, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABG who comes with three weeks of
shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
.
CAD: s/p CABG (2009-01-06 00:00:00). Patient presented with dyspnea over three
weeks.  She did not have EKG changes and she did not have
elevation in her cardiac enzymes. Given her risk factors and her
equivocal presentation, she underwent a nuclear stress test
which showed a fixed defect in the PDA territory  and
hypokinesis of the mid and basal inferior wall and the basal
inferoseptum with preserved systolic function. She underwent
cardiac catheterization which showed a patent LIMA to LAD graft,
patent SVG to OM1 and an occluded SVG to RCA. She had stenosis
of the native RCA. An attempt was made to angioplasty the native
RCA; however, this was complicated by dissection. The patient
remained hemodynamically stable and completely asymptomatic
during and after the attempted intervention, and a
post-procedure ECG demonstrated no changes from baseline. The
patient and her husband were apprised of the complication in
detail, and appeared to understand that the vessel was not
amenable to further intervention at this time, and that medical
management was appropriate. She was admitted to the CCU
overnight for monitoring and remained stable. She returned to
the regular floor for medical optimization. She was discharged
on aspirin, a betablocker, Sarkisyan, and a statin. She was scheduled
for repeat nuclear stress test as an outpatient with an eye
toward enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation to be coordinated by
her cardiologist.
.
#. SOB - Her dyspnea was likely an anginal equivalent for this
patient or a manifestation of heart failure due to occlusion of
her SVG-RCA graft. She also had a history of diastolic heart
failure, although no current evidence of pulmonary edema. Her EF
on this hospitalization was 45% due to regional dysfunction. She
also endorsed weight gain over the last year and has a history
of COPD, all of which could have contributed to her symptoms.
She was encouraged to take her Spiriva consistently and weight
loss is encouraged. Her presentation and hospital course was
discussed with her PCP with whom she will have close outpatient
follow up. She was without dyspnea on exertion at the time of
discharge, and was able to ambulate maintaining her oxygen
saturation in the high 90s on room air. She reported feeling
markedly improved in regards to her shortness of breath as
compared to her baseline presentation.
.
#HTN: Prior to admission she had presented to her
endocrinologist's office with systolic blood pressures in the
180s. Her atenolol was discontinued at that time and she was
started on Coreg 25mg twice a day. She was bradycardic in the
50s on admission, and her Coreg as reduced to 12.5mg twice a
day.  She was discharged on this dose. Her blood pressure should
continue to be monitored as an outpatient and she was encouraged
to check home BP readings periodically to ensure optimal
control.
.
#. Increased creatinine - Her Cr was 1.3 on admission. She
received prehydration and treatment with mucomyst prior to
catheterization. Her Cr increased to 1.6 post cath. Her lasix
and avapro were temporarily held, and restarted as her
creatinine improved.
.
# Diabetes: She had a history of diabetes mellitus managed with
insulin. Her HBA1C on this admission was 9.3%. Tighter glycemic
control was encouraged, with insulin dosing to be titrated as an
outpatient, in conjunction with dietary discretion and exercise.
She was counseled on the adverse cardiovascular and general
health consequences of suboptimal glycemic control.
