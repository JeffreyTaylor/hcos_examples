History of Present Illness:
Mr. Krinke is an 82 yo male s/p prolonged hospital and
rehabilitation course following XRT for 123 Any St. cell carcinoma
who presents with acute onset shortness of breath at UPMCE
Rehab earlier today. Per report, oxygen saturation dropped to
84-85% on 4L NC from baseline in the mid 90's. He was
hypotensive with SBP's in the 80's, which resolved with IVF. Per
report from UPMCE Rehab, patient was noted to have new thick
brown sputum with difficulty swallowing. He was recently started
on levofloxacin/flagyl three days ago for treatment of a
presumed aspiration pneumonia.
.
Of note, he was admitted to NEBH in 2014-03-16 00:00:00 for ? pneumonia,
then discharged to rehab and readmitted for dyspnea and
hemoptysis. He was placed on BiPAP and later intubated with a
two-week course complicated by ARDS, ARF requiring temporary HD,
acute delirium, and thrombocytopenia. He was treated with a
steroid taper for COPD exacerbation and broad spectrum
antibiotics. He was discharged to UPMCE Rehab on 2014-03-16 00:00:00.
Per his wife, he has made significant gains over the past month
while at UPMCE Rehab.
.
On arrival to the ED, SpO2 95% on NRB, RR 32, HR 96, BP 121/47.
He received vancomycin 1 g IV, Cefepime 2 g IV, solumedrol 125
mg IV, and a combivent neb.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 3:20 AM
AP PORTABLE CHEST: Heart size, mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. The aorta is mildly tortuous and there are
atherosclerotic calcifications of the arch. There is patchy
airspace consolidation at the right lung base which partially
obscures the hemidiaphragm consistent with right lower lobe
pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion on this radiograph that
does not fully include the right costophrenic sulcus. Left lung
is clear. No pneumothorax. The acromioclavicular joints appear
narrowed bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
ECG Study Date of 2014-03-16 00:00:00  3:20:30 AM
Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. Ventricular ectopy. Non-specific
inferior
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing the rate is
faster and
ectopy is present.
TRACING #1
.
ECG Study Date of 2014-03-16 00:00:00  8:47:02 AM
Sinus rhythm. Atrial ectopy. Non-specific inferior ST-T wave
changes.
Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing ventricular ectopy is no longer
present.
TRACING #2
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 5:17 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2014-03-16 00:00:00, there is poor
definition of the left hemidiaphragm with some increased
opacification suggesting atelectasis or pneumonia at the left
base. The right basilar opacification is again seen and probably
is of little change.
The upper lung zones are clear.
.
2014-03-16 00:00:00 2:07 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
CHEST, SUPINE PORTABLE: Comparison is made to earlier on the
same day. A new nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
However, the sidehole lies only immediately beyond the expected
site of the gastroesophageal junction. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. Bibasilar parenchymal opacities are also
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: New nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach.
However, the tube could be advanced further in order to gain
greater purchase, as the side hole lies near the
gastroesophageal junction.
.
2014-03-16 00:00:00 4:26 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, there
is little change in the position of the nasogastric tube. The
side port remains in the region of the GE junction, and the tube
should be advanced 6-10 cm for optimal positioning.
Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
.
ECHO 2014-03-16 00:00:00:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%), which may be partially due to rhythm
(appears to be atrial fibrillation based on the transmitral
Doppler profile). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 10:34 AM
Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm within the
stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right
perihilar and bibasilar opacities appear similar to the 123 Any St.us
examination. Bilateral small-to- moderate pleural effusions are
partially layering on this semi-upright radiograph, and there
are possible calcified pleural plaques. PA and lateral
radiograph prior to discharge may be helpful to confirm this
impression.
.
2014-03-16 00:00:00 7:20 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Incompletely visualized
are small-to- moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis of the dependent lower lobes. Coronary
artery calcifications are present.
Evaluation of the solid organs is limited by the non- contrast
technique.
Numerous punctate calcifications are noted scattered throughout
the liver and spleen consistent with old granulomatous disease.
There is a small splenule adjacent to the spleen. There are
extensive abdominal arterial vascular calcifications due to
atherosclerosis. There are cysts of the left kidney and other
small hypodensities too small to characterize. The right kidney
is abnormally small, cystic, and atrophic with coarse
calcification along its medial aspect from old insult. There is
no hydronephrosis. The pancreas is atrophic. The gallbladder is
unremarkable.
Extensive soft tissue and mesenteric edema and a small amount of
ascites is noted. Oral contrast has passed through to the
s123 Any St. flexure of colon. There are no dilated loops of small or
large bowel. There is no evidence of obstruction or
pneumoperitoneum. There are numerous colonic diverticula. The
descending and sigmoid colon are not well evaluated due to lack
of oral contrast opacification and distention. Extensive
mesenteric edema and small amount of ascites also complicates
assessment for wall thickening; however, there is apparent wall
thickening of the sigmoid and lower descending colon, as well as
the cecum. There is no loculated fluid collection or abscess.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The right hip arthroplasty
causes streak artifact which somewhat obscures the pelvis. Small
amount of ascites layers into the pelvis. Stool is present in
the rectum. Foley catheter is in the bladder.
BONE WINDOWS: There are extensive degenerative changes of the
visualized spine. Patient is status post laminectomy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Wall thickening involving the sigmoid colon and possibly
cecum consistent with colitis, more likely infectious. No
evidence of megacolon or pneumoperitoneum. No abscess
identified, within the limits of noncontrast examination.
2. Diverticulosis.
3. Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and
arteries.
4. Atrophic right kidney.
5. Anasarca.
6. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 5:08 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 2014-03-16 00:00:00 and 30:
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion right greater than left has
increased more substantially on the right than the left since
2014-03-16 00:00:00. Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular
engorgement have worsened. Right lower lung is obscured by
effusion, left shows increasing atelectasis. Upper lungs are
clear aside from mild vascular engorgement. Nasogastric tube
ends in the stomach. No pneumothorax.
Sequence of changes suggests earlier left heart failure has
progressed to biventricular or predominantly right-sided
decompensation.
.
ECG Study Date of 2014-03-16 00:00:00  5:14:32 AM
Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy. Diffuse non-specific
ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2014-03-16 00:00:00 no
diagnostic interim
change.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  2014-03-16 00:00:00 2:40 PM
FINDINGS: There is a new right PICC line with tip in the right
atrium. There is an NG tube coiled in the stomach. There are
moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe
volume loss. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be
excluded. The appearance of the lungs is not significantly
changed compared to the film from the prior day.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 12:45 PM
FINDINGS: The NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is moderate
bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe volume
loss. An underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded. There is
pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze, suggesting
CHF. The right PICC line is unchanged.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 11:27 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison to the 123 Any St.us examination, the size of
the cardiac silhouette is slightly decreased. The extent of the
bilateral pleural effusions is stable. Moderate bibasilar
atelectasis, no secure evidence of pneumonia. The nasogastric
tube is in unchanged position.
IMPRESSION: Otherwise, no relevant changes.
.
ECG Study Date of 2014-03-16 00:00:00  11:30:46 AM
Sinus rhythm. P-R interval is 110 milliseconds. Poor R wave
progression
across the anterior precordial leads, probably a normal variant.
Non-specifc inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2014-03-16 00:00:00 no atrial ectopy is seen. The
other findings are similar.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2014-03-16 00:00:00 2:17 AM
SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion
unchanged. No focal consolidation. Lung fields are clear. No
pneumothorax. Unchanged aortic knob calcification. Hilar
contour, cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits.
The heart size is upper limit of normal. NG tube with tip in the
stomach is noted.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged moderate layering bilateral pleural
effusion. No acute cardiopulmonary process or significant
changes since prior radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical ICU with a diagnosis of
pnemonia, likely aspiration. He was given broad spectrum
antibiotics including Vancomycin and Zosyn. His course was
notable for decreased urine output, which responded well to
fluid boluses. Also, he developed atrial fibrillation on the
evening of the 28th. This was managed with Digoxin and
metoprolol.  He had difficulty swallowing and an NG tube was
placed. A stool culture was positive for C-Difficile and he was
started on metronidazole.  He has a baseline dementia and he did
become agitated with placement of the NG tube necessitating
restraints. He was transferred to the floor, where he remained
on vanc/zosyn.  He continued to have intermittent desats thought
to be 2014-03-16 00:00:00 to mucous plugging, and his floor course was notable
for significant pulmonary congestion.  Sputum grew out MRSA,
urine grew out yeast.  CT abdomen was suspicious for colitis.
His flagyl was changed to PO vancomycin. He was maintained on
metoprolol 12.5 UPMCE for rate control of his afib.  He then
experienced acute hypoxia, and was transferred to the MICU on
2014-03-16 00:00:00.  This was likely another aspiration event.  There, his
wife requested Kaira Krinke status, his non-comfort medications were
discontinued, and he subsequently expired on 2014-03-16 00:00:00.
