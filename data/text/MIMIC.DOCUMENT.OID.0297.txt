Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
2014-09-05 00:00:00.  CXR.
IMPRESSION:
Possible superimposed right middle lung field infection on
background of pulmonary fibrosis.
.
Chest CT.  2014-09-05 00:00:00.
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal improvement in moderately severe generalized
interstitial lung disease. Persistent air trapping. No evidence
of pulmonary hypertension, intrathoracic malignancy or
infection.
2. Longstanding pneumobilia.
.
PFTs 2014-09-05 00:00:00.
Mechanics: The FVC is markedly reduced. The FEV1 is moderately
to markedly reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is elevated.
Flow-Volume Loop: Marked restrictive pattern.
.
Impression:
Results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect,
which is confirmed by the markedly reduced TLC measured on
2014-09-05 00:00:00. Compared to the prior study of 2014-09-05 00:00:00 there has
been no significant change.
.
Echo 2014-09-05 00:00:00.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch
pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of 2014-09-05 00:00:00, the right ventricle is markedly dilated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Brahm is a 73 yo female with PTLD s/p R-CHOP, s/p liver
Brahm in 2014-09-05 00:00:00 for cryptogenic cirrhosis, pulmonary
fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and HTN admitted for constellation of
non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, urinary incontinence,
shortness of breath, and leg swelling.
.
#Dyspnea/fatigue:  Her dypnea on admission was concerning for
PNA.  She was started on Vanco but PNA was ruled out and this
was stopped after 3 days.  Diastolic HF was also considered, but
TTE was unchanged from prior. Patient only required 3L 02
maximum and was quickly weaned to her home 02 is 2L.  She felt
at baseline during the admission.  2014-09-05 00:00:00 be secondary to
deconditioning. Also may be component to known pulmonary
fibrosis and moderate pulmonary HTN (but not changed from prior
per repeat TTE yesterday).  Patient was continued on home dose
of prednisone 40mg PO daily. Patient weaned back to home O2 dose
at 2L NC. Hemodynamically stable.
.
# Atrial fibfillation:  Patient had sinus tachycardia and then
A. fib with RVR on day of admission (has h/o a fib).   Her TSH
was normal, no evidence of dehydration. Patient was started on
25 mg metoprolol TID and this was weaned up to 37.5 TID as her
blood pressure tolerated.  Her CHADS score was 3.  We spoke to
her oncologist who said there was no hematologic reason she
couldn't be anti-coagulated.  However, she was not immediately
started on anti-coagulation because of her high risk for falls.
 We also apoke with her PCP about following up this issue as an
outpatient after the patient has undergone rehab.

-f/u PCP appointment to address question of anti-coagulation
.
# S/p liver 2014-09-05 00:00:00: Liver 2014-09-05 00:00:00 surgery aware patient
is in hospital.  We continued her on her home tacrolimus and
checked levels daily.
.
#IPF:  Patient requires 2-2.5L/NC at home, which was continued
while she was in the hospital.  TTE showed no worsening of
pulmonary hypertension, so we continued her on her home dose of
Prednisone 40 mg daily.
.
#DM. On NPH and RISS: Patient was hyperglycemic into the
400s/500s while in the MICU.  She was briefly on insulin gtt,
but discontinued as caused hypoglycemia. NPH uptitrated due to
high BS to 30/10 and then downtirated to 30/8 given early
morning hypoglycemia.  Also continued on sliding scale.
.
#Dispo: PT saw the patient and recommended short term rehab.
Patient will follow up with her 2014-09-05 00:00:00 doctor, in particular
to follow up her tacrolimus.
Patient will see her heme/onc doctors who Eli Brahm decide about
anticoagulation.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with shortness of breath and lower
extremity swelling.   We believe this was due to your pulmonary
fibrosis and to a urinary tract infection.  We treated your
infection with levofloxacin and your breathing with steroids and
increased oxygen.  We also found you to have atrial fibrillation
which we treated with metoprolol.  Finally, your blood sugar was
high and we treated you with sliding scale insulin.

We made the following changes to your medications:
Started Levofloxacin for total 7 day course.
Changed NPH to 30 units qAM and 8 units qPM
Started Metoprolol 37.5 po tid
