HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 59-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular
disease status post above the knee amputation, bilateral
carotid endarterectomies, femoral-popliteal bypass, who
presented on 2008-07-04 00:00:00 with shortness of breath after being
found by her daughter obtunded and cyanotic, with the oxygen
nasal cannula removed.  The patient presented to the
Emergency Room on 2008-07-04 00:00:00 with shortness of breath,
progressive over the course of the preceding days.  Her
daughter reported finding the patient cyanotic and obtunded,
lying in bed with her oxygen nasal cannula removed from her
face.  The patient also reported progressively increasing
swelling of her extremities in the days preceding admission.
On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was 98%
on 3 liters nasal cannula.  She denied any chest pain, cough,
fever or chills.

According to the patient, she had been admitted to UPMCE
Hospital several times between 2008-07-04 00:00:00 and 2008-07-04 00:00:00 for
volume overload and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbations. Per patient, she was admitted in 2008-07-04 00:00:00 for
three months, and required three visits to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, with multi123 Any St.tubations.  She was
discharged from Tokarz in 2008-07-04 00:00:00, and she had just completed
her steroid taper that was initiated with these flares.  She
was then readmitted to Tokarz on 2008-07-04 00:00:00 with nausea,
vomiting, and lethargy, and was found on admission to be
febrile, with a potassium of 6.8, a blood sugar of 460, and
elevated transaminases.  At this time, the hyperkalemia was
thought secondary to Zestril, which was discontinued.  She
was treated with insulin and Kayexalate and discharged to
home on 2008-07-04 00:00:00.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (dependent on home
oxygen, uses steroids during flares, history of multiple
intubations)
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in 2008-07-04 00:00:00
4.  Peripheral vascular disease status post femoral-popliteal
bypass, right above the knee amputation, bilateral carotid
endarterectomies
5.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
6.  Bipolar disorder

ALLERGIES:   Sulfa, Tolinase

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives alone in UPMCE.
Her daughter lives in the area, and helps to care for her.
Her daughter has offered to have the patient move in with
her, but the patient has been reluctant to do so for fear of
becoming a burden to her daughter.  The patient admits to
multiple suicide attempts with pills in the last few years,
most recently a few months ago.  The patient also reports
severe depression following the death of her husband from
Cortaz Tokarz disease last year.  The patient also expresses
extreme frustration with the intensive medical care which she
has had to receive over the course of the last few years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission to the Emergency
Department, the patient had a temperature of 97.7, pulse of
70, blood pressure 105/54, respiratory rate 14, and oxygen
saturation of 98% on 3 liters by nasal cannula.  In general,
she was comfortable, breathing rapidly, in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed the
patient to have severe facial edema, and her extraocular
muscles were intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to
light.  On neck examination, there was no jugular venous
distention, and no carotid bruits.  On lung examination, she
had decreased air movement in both lung fields, but no
wheezes or rales.  On heart examination, she had distant
heart sounds, a regular rate and rhythm, with a II/VI
systolic murmur, loudest at the right upper sternal border,
with no gallops.  On abdominal examination, she had normal
active bowel sounds.  Her abdomen was soft, nondistended and
nontender.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and no guarding
or rebound.  On extremity examination, her right leg (status
post above the knee amputation), there was pitting edema in
the thigh.  In her left leg, there was pitting edema to the
thigh.  On neurological examination, she was alert and
oriented x 3, extraocular muscles were intact, pupils equal,
round and reactive to light, moved three extremities, 2+
patellar reflex on the left.

LABORATORY DATA:   CBC showed white blood cells of 7.4,
hematocrit 33.7, platelets 245.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.5,
chloride 101, CO2 25, BUN 43, creatinine 0.9, glucose 260.
Calcium 8.3, magnesium 4.7, phosphate 2.2.  Ionized calcium
1.13.  PT 14.9, PTT 25.6, INR 1.5.  Arterial blood gas
77/58/7.4.  CK was 81, troponin less than 0.3.  Urinalysis
showed glucose of 500, but otherwise normal.

IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion and
atelectasis vs. pneumonia in the right lower lobe.  There
were indistinct perihilar structures, but no overt pulmonary
edema.  An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 75
beats per minute, Q waves in II, III and AVF, right bundle
branch block with ST depression in V2 to V3, with T wave
inversion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In the Emergency Department, the patient
was diuresed 1700 cc.  She was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit due to perceived respiratory distress.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, she was ruled out for
myocardial infarction, and diuresis was continued with
symptomatic improvement.  She was called out to the floor the
next morning.

On examination upon transfer to the floor, the patient was
found to have signs of significant right heart failure
greater than left heart failure, although prior records
showed evidence of severe left ventricular dysfunction as
well as right ventricular dysfunction.  On the floor, she was
aggressively diuresed with lasix and Zaroxolyn.  The patient
responded well to this diuresis, and overall was
approximately 20 liters negative by the time of discharge to
rehabilitation.

Given her history of hyperkalemia, the patient was diuresed
with lasix and Zaroxolyn without addition of an ACE inhibitor
and Aldactone.  She was continued on her beta blocker and
Digoxin.  During the admission, the patient's standing
insulin dose was increased from baseline, and her blood
sugars decreased from the high 200s on admission to the low
100s prior to discharge.  The patient was changed back to her
baseline insulin regimen prior to discharge in the context of
a steroid taper.  Her hemoglobin A1c was found to be 11.3,
indicating poor chronic control of her diabetes mellitus.
During the admission, her triglycerides were 91, HDL 44, LDL
111.

During this admission, the patient expressed great
dissatisfaction with her current quality of life, feeling
degraded by a lack of motility and a lack of autonomy.
Psychiatry was consulted, and they concluded that the patient
was capable of making decisions about whether and how
aggressively to pursue standard medical care.  The palliative
care team was also consulted to discuss with the patient her
goals for treatment.  The patient decided to pursue medical
treatment despite her ambivalence about her goals--she
desires to be alive, to enjoy her family, while at the same
time she sees how difficult it is to lose her independence.
After extensive discussion with the palliative care team, Ms.
Tokarz decided to continue medical treatment for now, and
opted for discharge to UPMCE rehabilitation before
moving in with her daughter at her home.  Physical Therapy
has seen the patient, and has decided that she is a good
candidate for physical rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to UPMCE rehabilitation
facility.

17. Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth once daily

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient plans to move to UPMCE
rehabilitation for approximately ten days before moving in at
her daughter's residence.  The goals for treatment at
UPMCE rehabilitation include:
1.  Diuresis with a goal of 1 to 2 liters negative per day.
Will need to check BUN, creatinine, potassium, HCO3 daily for
the first three to four days of rehabilitation.  Lasix and
potassium chloride doses will need to be adjusted as
necessary.
2.  The patient will need physical therapy for moving out of
bed to chair.
3.  The patient will need to begin a prednisone taper
beginning with prednisone 20 mg by mouth once daily for three
days, prednisone 10 mg by mouth once daily for three days,
and then prednisone 5 mg by mouth once daily for three days,
and then no prednisone.
4.  The patient will need to be continued on home oxygen (2
to 3 liters via nasal cannula).
5.  If potassium remains stable on current regimen, can
consider reinstituting ACE inhibitor and Aldactone at a later
time.
