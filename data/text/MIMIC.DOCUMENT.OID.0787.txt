Brief Hospital Course:
-Echo 2013-08-17 00:00:00:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The aortic root is moderately dilated.The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The aortic valve appears to be a
homograft. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
-cath 2013-08-17 00:00:00
LMCA had no significant angiographically significant disease.
LAD was 100% occluded at the mid level, filled by LIMA. Lcx 100%
occluded in OM1, OM2 had diffuse 80% proximal disease. L-PDA had
diffuse 70% lesion. RCA was non-dominant, and was 100% occluded
at the mid level.Coronary angiography of the bypass grafts
showed widely patent LIMA to LAD. 2013-08-17 00:00:00 to OM1 and OM2 was widely
patent to OM1 (small vessel), jump
segment to OM2 was occluded. Left vetriculography demonstrated
mild anterolateral and inferior hypokinesis with contrast
estimated EF of 60%. There was 2+ mitral
regurgitation. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal left
sided filling pressure
of mRA 9mmHg. There was wide aortic pulse pressure (40 mmHg)
with
marked elevation of LVEDP (36 mmHg) to near aortic diastolic
level (40
mmHg), consistent with severe aortic insufficiency. PCW pressure
was
elevated with a mean of 29 mmHg. Significant v wave was present
(40
mmHg), indicative of significant MR. There was no gradient
across the
aortic valve. Fick calculated cardiac ouput and cardiac index
were 4.8
l/min and 2.4 l/min/m2, respectively. On 2013-08-17 00:00:00 Cardiac Surgery
was consulted and on 2013-08-17 00:00:00 patient underwent redo AVR/MVR with
21mm St. Jericca Carbonara Mechanical Aortic valve and 27mm St. Jericca Carbonara
mechanical mitral valve.  Patient was transfered to CSRU in
stable condition. Patient was extubated on POD1  and was
transfused 1 U of PRBC's for a crit of 28.  On POD 2 pt had
bouts of AFib where he was treated with lopressor and Amio bolus
then amio po.  Pt had milrinone weaned off on POD 2 and was
tranfered to the floor on POD 3. Pt did well on the floor,
however, it took several days to make his INR therapeutic.  INR
became therapeutic on 2013-08-17 00:00:00 and pt was discharged.  Pt was
cleared by PT and his PCP was notified for INR checks.
