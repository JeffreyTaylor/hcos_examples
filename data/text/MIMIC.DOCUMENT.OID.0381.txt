HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Fifty-five year old with male
with end-stage renal disease who is hemodialysis dependent,
who at dialysis session aborted midway on Hannemann, 2014-07-17 00:00:00 because he developed chest pain midway through dialysis.
Per his wife, he has had very frequent episodes of chest pain
more than 10 during dialysis since he was started on
hemodialysis in 2014-07-17 00:00:00.  He went to a hospital in
UPMCE, where he was started on nitrodrip.  His chest pain
resolved and has not returned since, and he went home the
next day.  His wife noted that the workup for his chest pain
has been negative in the past including a cardiac
catheterization done in 2014-07-17 00:00:00 which showed normal
coronary arteries.

Since the night prior to admission, he has had cough.  No
fevers, no chills.  He missed dialysis today, 2014-07-17 00:00:00
because he was sent to the Emergency Department from home
shortly before he was scheduled for his 5 pm dialysis.  He
denies any changes in his diet or noncompliance with dietary
restrictions.  He has been unable to lie flat this past day
due to shortness of breath.  This is new compared with his
baseline.  He does not complain of shortness of breath at
rest currently, and says that he is able to work, but that
his exercise tolerance is markedly decreased compared with
his baseline.  In the Emergency Department, his oxygen
saturation on room air is 80%, so he was begun on a
nonrebreather mask.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 55-year-old male with history
of diabetes, hepatitis C, and end-stage renal disease,
hemodialysis dependent, presenting with dyspnea in the
setting of incomplete dialysis three days ago and missed
dialysis today.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Dyspnea:  Patient's shortness of breath is most likely
secondary to pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure
secondary to missing hemodialysis on the day of presentation
and having it interrupted on the days prior.  His respiratory
status improved after hemodialysis on the night of admission,
2014-07-17 00:00:00, but he is still needed increased oxygen from
baseline.

respiratory status.  On 2014-07-17 00:00:00, he was again taken to
hemodialysis with a new goal dry weight of 65.5 kg.
Following dialysis, the patient's respiratory status had
improved to 97% on 3 liters nasal cannula.

On 2014-07-17 00:00:00, he was transferred from the MICU to the General
Medicine floor due to the improvement of his respiratory
status and in preparation for discharge.

2. Renal:  Patient underwent hemodialysis on two occasions,
2014-07-17 00:00:00 and 2014-07-17 00:00:00 as the patient would not be able to
have dialysis done on the holiday, 2014-07-17 00:00:00.  A new goal dry
weight was 65.5 kg.  The patient presented with a weight of
76.5 kg.  Patient will continue his regular hemodialysis
schedule starting the next week.

3. Noncardiac chest pain:  Patient has had unrevealing
extensive workup of his chest pain in the past that has not
been connected with cardiac pathology.  No further evaluation
was indicated during this admission.  He was continued on his
dosed at 325 mg po q day as well as his other medications for
blood pressure and heart rate control including Lopressor,
hydralazine, Cozaar, and Norvasc.

4. Heme:  The patient was continued on Epogen with dialysis
and treatment of his chronic anemia.

5. Endocrine:  For the patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus, he
was continued on a regular insulin-sliding scale, and he was
given his regular NPH am dose.

6. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient was
continued on Renagel and renal diet, and vitamin
supplementation.

7. Prophylaxis:  Protonix and pneumoboots.

8. Code status:  Full code.

9. Vascular:  Patient has extensive peripheral vascular
disease, and is also noted to have a pseudoaneurysm on his
carotid on the right side.  He is followed by Vascular
Service and has a follow-up appointment on 2014-07-17 00:00:00 regarding
these issues.
