Attending:Egor Blotner
Chief Complaint:
Right coronary artery ST-elevation myocardial infarction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Patient reports she was 123 Any St. a book at 1500h at home today
and had sudden onset bilateral arm pain and heaviness from the
biceps to the lower arms and chest pain. Per telephone triage,
she also had wheezing and was very anxious. She had never had
chest pain like this before. She was sent to the ED and recieved
325mg of ASA and Morphine 10mg IV prior to arrival. She received
Oxygen, Plavix 600mg heparin bolus 4200u IV and integrillin
bolus 12mg IV. EKG demonstrated STE in II, III, AvF as well as
in Right sided leads V3-V6 concerning for inferior infarct and
RCA occlusion. Paatient was taken to cath lab and underwent PTCA
with deployment of three BMS in the proximal RCA. She tolerated
the procedure well and was admitted to the CCU for
post-operative care.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion

Pertinent Results:
2013-11-20 00:00:00: Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
two vessel disease.  The LMCA was normal without significant
stenosis.
The LAD has no obstructive disease with 60% stenosis in the
origin of
the first diagonal.  The LCx was normal without obstructive
disease.
The RCA had a total occlusion in the proximal part of the
vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal central aortic

pressure 135/84 with a mean of 113 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA/Stenting of proximal/mid RCA with three
overlapping
VISION 3.0 X 12 mm Baremetal stents along with Export
thrombectomey
resulting in 0% residual stenosis and normal flow.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Inferior STEMI with successful placememt of three bare-metal
stents
in proximal and mid RCA.

CTA Head/Neck 2013-11-20 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:

1. CT head demonstrates no acute intracranial process; within
the limitation of persistent contrast in the major cerebral
arteries from recent cardiac catheterization, limiting the
resolution of thrombus detection.

2. Global dilatation of ventricles, unchanged since the earlier
MR study of 2013-11-20 00:00:00, in keeping with a degree of
central cerebral volume loss.

3. CTA neck demonstrates no hemodynamically significant
stenosis,
craniocervical dissection or luminal narrowing.

4. Impression of luminal narrowing and soft tissue density at
the upper
cervical esophagus, near its ostium. Re-evaluation of symptoms
is advised,
with direct inspection with upper endoscopy, particularly if
warranted on
clinical grounds.

4. Extensive centrilobular emphysema involving both upper lobes.


MRI 2013-11-20 00:00:00: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
Unchanged global dilatation of ventricles in keeping with
central volume loss since the earlier MR study of 2013-11-20 00:00:00.

Echo results:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with very mild hypokinesis
of the inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 55 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Very mild focal left ventricular hypokinesis c/w
CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly this is a 75 YO woman with remote history of exertional
angina presenting with sudden onset bilateral arm pain secondary
to RCA STEMI.
.
# Right Coronary Artery STEMI: The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization with placement of three bare metal stents in the
proximal and mid RCA with no complications. Her pressures were
supported postoperativly with IV fluids. Integrillin was hung
for 18 hours post-procedure. Her EKG and troponins returned to
123 Any St.. She was angina-free for the duration of her
hospitalization. Her BB was initially held secondary to risk of
high degree heart block following RCA STEMI. She remained in
normal sinus rhythm for the duration of her hospitalization and
was restarted at metoprolol XL 25mg PO daily. She should
continue aspirin and plavix for 30 days post operatively.
.
Slurred speech: Immediatly post-procedure the patient was noted
to have slurred speech and confusion that was a deviation from
baseline mental status per her son. Neurology was consulted.
Imaging of the head and neck was without evidence of hemmorhage
but 123 Any St.inary reads were concerning for apossible left ICA
thrombus. She was started on a heparin drip overnight. Further
review of the imaging the following morning was not consistent
with an ICA thrombus and the heparin was stopped. A follow up
MRI was negative for any intracranial process. Her AMS was
thought to be secondary to sedative medications received during
the procedure and ICU delirium. She began to clear within two
days.
.
Incidental finding on Neck CTA:  Imaging also showed an
incidental finding of luminal narrowing and soft tissue density
at the upper cervical esophagus, near its ostium. Follow-up
evaluation is advised with EGD especially if clinically
correlated. The patient was asymptomatic during her
hospitalization. The pateint should follow up with her primary
care physician to determine if further evaluation is needed.

# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home levothyroxine.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
123 Any St.

Discharge Diagnosis:
ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction
Hypertension
Dyslipidemia
Chronic Memory Loss with Acute Delerium


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and needed to have 3 bare metal stents
placed in your right coronary artery. You have not had any
further chest pain since this procedure. You will need to take
aspirin and plavix every day for at least one month and possibly
longer to prevent the stents from clotting off and causing
another heart attack. Do not stop taking these medicines unless
Dr.Catonya Rivet tells you it is OK.
You have some bruising in your groin from the catheterization,
this should resolve slowly. You also had some confusion we call
delerium from being in the hospital, this should resolve
completely over the next few weeks.
Medication changes:
1. Start taking aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel) to prevent the
stents from clotting off
2. Start taking Metoprolol to help your heart recover from the
heart attack
3. Start taking Atorvastatin (Lipitor) to prevent more blockages
in your heart arteries.
4. Stop taking Nexium, take Ranitidine instead to prevent
heartburn.
