1. Bilateral common femoral artery cutdown.
2. Right common iliac artery and external iliac artery

History of Present Illness:
74F with a known 5.3x7.2cm AAA presented to her PCP for Dyanira Bou non
contrast CT screening test secondary to recent weight loss which
revealed enlargement of the aneuysm. She was referred to Dr.
Bou for further evaluation and contrast enhanced CT revealed a
6.6x9.0cm aneurysm. Given the findings of enlargement, COPD and
irregular shape she was at a high risk for rupture. Also
secondary to her comorbidities she was not an open repair
candidate. She was then evaluate for endovascular repair for
which her imaging was sent for three-dimensional reconstruction
and a suitable endovascular option was found. She agreed to the
procedure given the risks of renal failure requiring dialysis,
respiratory failure, and death.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on 2005-01-05 00:00:00 for repair of AAA. She
underwent an endovascular repair with no intraoperative
complications. She also had an inguinal hernia found at the time
of her operation which ACS was consulted intraoperatively and
stated she could undergo elective repair. Postoperatively she
remained intubated and required neosynephrine to maintain her
blood pressure. As her pressor requirement increased her
postoperative labs revealed a Hct of 19 for which she received 3
units of PRBCs, 2 units of FFP and 2 units of cyro. With
resuscitation she was able to be weaned off of vasopressors,
made NPO, remained intubated and was transferred to the CVICU.

POD 0 - Cordis was placed for further hemodynamic monitoring, 1
unit PRBC transfused

POD 1 - Remained intubated, started on nitro gtt for blood
pressure control

POD 2 - Found to have increased troponin from 0.16 to 0.28,
cardiology consulted who believed she underwent a NSTEMI and
recommended ECHO, aggressive beta blockade and holding 2005-01-05 00:00:00
initially considering her platelet count of < 75K. She was also
started on hydralazine in addition to Metoprolol 10mg IV Q6
hours for blood pressure control. HITT panel sent for
thrombocytopenia. Given lasix with no response. Passed SBT.

POD 3 - Was extubated after meeting requirements. Swan removed.

POD 4 - Started on oral intake, lopressor changed to 37.5mg UPMCE
PO and started on Ciprofloxacin for GNR growing from sputum.

POD 5 - Transferred to VICU from CVICU, cordis changed to triple
lumen CVL, Metoprolol increased to 50mg UPMCE, had minimal
response to 20mg IV times 2 of lasix. Cr 2.7, given 5% albumin
for decreased UOP.

POD 6 - Aline and JP removed. Metoprolol 75mg UPMCE.

POD 7 - Started on Levaquin for STENOTROPHOMONAS in sputum. NGT
placed for vomiting. placed on MIVF.

POD 8 - Started on Toprol 150mg daily, methylnaltrexone given,
PT consult obtained and was able to get patient from out of bed
to chair.

POD 9 - NGT removed.

POD 10 - Continued to have abdominal distention. Given one dose
of methylnaltrexone. Cr decreased to 2.3. Started prn diuresis
based on UOP.

POD 11 - Abdomen found to be distended, had episode of emesis,
NGT placed. Reglan started.

POD 12 - Started on Day 1 TPN, continued to have nausea and
emesis in AM.

POD 13 - Made NPO and started on Day 1 TPN. Had one episode of
emesis. KUB revealed air fluid levels.

POD 14 - Fentanyl patch started, received two 500cc boluses for
decreased UOP. Was evaluated by renal service who believed to
ARF to be caused by hypovolemia. Levaquin stopped after 8 day
course. Started on 100cc/hr of MIVF and changed to H2 blocker.

POD 15 - CT scan obtained for persistent abdominal distention
which revealed a possible early SBO versus ileus. Continued to
have no abdominal pain. PICC placed.

POD 16 - Had two bowel movements after suppository stimulation.
TPN continued.

POD 17 - Continued TPN, NGT remained, no bowel function.

POD 18 - Patient became lethargic and minimally arousable.
Fentanyl patch was removed. Overnight patient became more
difficult to arouse and would not respond to deep sternal rub. A
stat head CT was performed revealing no evidence of acute
stroke. Narcan times two was administered to rule out narcotic
overdose with no response. ABG was within normal limits,
electrolytes and cbc were also within normal limits. An emergent
neurology consult was obtained who recommended no further acute
interventions. Reglan, famotidine and fentanyl patch were all
discontinued. Began having epistaxis after narcan with elevated
SBP in the 180. Lopressor, hydralazine and dilaudid were given
with a decrease in SBP.

POD 19 - NGT changed to Left nare. Began having epistaxis in the
setting of hypertension with SBP in the 180s which was not
response to hydralazine. Patient had nasal packing placed and
ENT evaluated the patient who recommended continuation of the
packing and Clindamycin while the packing was in place. Later in
the evening it was noted that the patient began having jerking
motions consistent with seizure activity. Patient was emergently
transferred to the ICU and intubated and sedated on a midazolam
drip. Neurology was called who believed this to be seizures and
recommended continuation of the midazolam drip and correction of
uremia given the possibility that this was encephalopathy
secondary to uremia. She continued to have seizures and was then
changed to dilantin however became bradycardic and the dilantin
was stopped and Keppra started. The family was informed of these
events and decided to make the patient DNR (able to continue
vasopressor but no compressions.) She was also started on CVVHD
to correct her uremia. A stat head CT revealed no acute
intracranial processes.

POD 20 - Placed on EEG monitoring. Patient continued to have
seizures and was then changed to Propofol, Versed and
Phenobarbital. She required the initiation of Dopamine and
levophed to maintain her SBP. With the continued seizure
activity refractory to medical therapy the family was called who
decided to make the patient CMO. The family understood that with
this action this would result in her death. The patient was made
CMO at 19:04 and expired at 20:40 on 2005-01-05 00:00:00. The family was at
the bedside at the time of death.
