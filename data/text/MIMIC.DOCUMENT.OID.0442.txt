Attending:Janyne Nakhleh
Chief Complaint:
catatonia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
51M w/ hx of depression, remote suicide attempts and OCD
presented to ED on 2005-01-18 00:00:00 with c/o being nonconversant. He was
being weaned off abilify over the past 3 weeks due to
"drowsiness", and 3 days ago the patient's mother, with whom he
lives, noticed that he was pacing the floor, a behavior that is
unusual for him, but otherwise was at his baseline which is
fully functional and independent in ADLs. The next morning
however he became nonconversant and minimally responsive to
verbal commands. After contacting his psychiatrist, his mother
brought the patient to the Ascher Patch for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.8 70 158/90 18 96RA
.
He was evaluated by psychiatry who felt his symptoms were due to
aquired catatonia in the setting of a mood disorder and weaning
off abilify. They noted that in the ED he exhibited mutism,
hypokinetic behavior, echolalia/echopraxia, posturing and
decreased eye blink. He was placed on section 12 and bed search
was initiated. However he became agitated yesterday afternoon
when he was ready to be transferred to an outside facility. He
was given ativan but eventurally required 4 point restraints.
Restraints were kept in place overnight, removed this morning,
but then replaced due to concern for fall risk as he would not
remain in his bed. His CK was noted to be trending upward, and
the ED requested that he be admitted to the MICU given possible
need for ativan drip, rising CK, and high risk for NMS.
.
Last vitals in ED: 97.8 70 158/90 18 96%RA. Just prior to
admission he was noted to be drowsy, with his last benzo dose of
ativan 2mg, midazolam 5mg at 1130hrs, and total of 20mg ativan
given during ED course. ED records noted his head CT was
negative for hemorrhage, mediastinum appeared widened on AP CXR,
and initial ECG showed sinus tachycardia with normal QTc
interval.
.
On arrival to the MICU patient was conversant, but remained
mildly agitated.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Patch is a 51 year old male with history of depression,
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and coronary artery disease
(CAD) who was admitted for catatonia and course was notable for
waxing and Janyne Nakhleh catatonia and agitation.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUES:
# Catatonia: He was seen by psychiatry and they felt that his
catatonia was most likely due to recent weaning from abilify
with exacerbation of underlying mood disorder (depression with
psychosis). In ED, patient exhibited agitation requiring 4 point
restraints for prolonged course, and 20mg lorazepman total. ECT
was entertained as a possible intervention for catatonia, and
was initially deferred as his catatonia resolved with standing
antipsychotics (haloperidol 10mg UPMCE, with ativan 1mg UPMCE).
Unfortunately, although his catatonia improved, Mr. Patch
psychosis did not continue to improve with haloperidol from
2005-01-18 00:00:00, and ECT was deemed necessary. He was scheduled to
begin ECT on 2005-01-18 00:00:00, and medical clearance was obtained, but
unfortunately Mr. Patch could not be consented for the
procedure and health care proxy authority for his mother was not
formalized. Mr. Ascher Patch remained in 2005-01-18 00:00:00 point restraints during
his floor stay.

# Leukocytosis/Fever/Pneumonia:  Mr. Ascher Patch was noted to have
difficulty with secretions on 2005-01-18 00:00:00 after recieving ativan for
agitation. CXR on 2005-01-18 00:00:00 2005-01-18 00:00:00 a left lower lobe
infiltrate and rhonchi on exam. Mr. Patch also was noted to
have low grade fevers (100.5-101), and leukocytosis to 14. He
was therefore felt to have pneumonia and symptoms with
levofloxacin for a 7 day course.

# Elevated creatine kinase (CK): Psychiatry was concerned his
elevated CK represented neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
He was admitted to the MICU but did not exhibit any signs or
symptoms of NMS including no fevers and had progressively
downtrending CK. Ultimately, the elevated CK was likely due to
thrashing in the ED.

#Transaminitis: Mr. Ascher Patch low-grade transaminitis
40-60s which is consistent with prior levels. This may be
secondary to known fatty liver disease or toxic effects of CK.
It persisted during admission without evidence of synthetic
dysfunction and should be followed as an outpatient. LFTs should
be monitored periodically as elevated aminotransferases may also
represent mild hepatotoxicity from the high doses of
antipsychotic medications he has been receiving. Viral hepatitis
serologies were within normal limits. Of note, his hepatitis B
surface antibody was negative, and future vaccination should be
considered.

# Groin pustule:  Noted by nurse in the MICU, was unroofed and
sent for culture, growing MSSA.  This was sensitive to
levofloxacin which he recieved for his pneumonia.

# Coronary artery disease (CAD): History of acute myocardial
infarction in 2005-01-18 00:00:00, stent placed in 2005-01-18 00:00:00.  ECG showed sinus
rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. He has a baseline widened
mediastinum found on prior CT to be fat deposits and
lymphadenopathy. We initially held his simvastatin and zetia
given elevated LFTs.  We continued his aspirin given his LAD
stent.

#Poor PO intake: Mr. Patch Patch refused to take PO
intake while on the floor. We continued IV fluids with D5 1/2 NS
at 125 cc/hr during his stay, but his hematocrit increased from
41 to 49 indicating hemoconcentration. We increased his IVF to
150 cc/hr on 2005-01-18 00:00:00, but his hct continued to rise from 2005-01-18 00:00:00 to
2005-01-18 00:00:00 from 47.6 to 49.6. We suggest increasing his IVF to D5 2005-01-18 00:00:00
NS at 200 cc/hr if he continues to refuse oral intake.

# Asthma: Continued home albuterol and ipratropium PRN.

# Communication: mother, Ascher Patch psychiatrist Dr. Patch

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Patch,
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you at UPMCE. You were admitted
to the hospital because you were having a manifestation of your
depression called catatonia.  There was concern that your
muscles were ungoing breakdown because of the catatonia so we
monitored you closely in the ICU, but your muscles turned out to
be recovering well.
.
Your catatonia was treated with medications called haldol and
lorazepam. Your depression and psychosis will need further
treatment with a procedure known as electroconvulsive therapy.
It is very important that you keep all of the appointments with
your doctors listed below.  You will be transfered to the
psychiatric UPMCE to continue to treat your depression and
psychosis.

Your psychiatric medications will be adjusted further during
your psychiatric hospitalization.
.
It is also very important that you take your medications
everyday.  The following changes were made to your medications:

1. Your Luvox and lamictal (treatments for depression and other
mood disorders) have been stopped, please consult with your
psychiatrists regarding whether to restart these.
START haloperidol (for your confusion)
START levofloxacin (for pneumonia), you will have 2 more days
START ativan for agitation
STOP simvastatin and START atorvastatin because we need to treat
your lipids, but the simvastatin may have been harming your
liver


Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your PCP after you are discharged from
deaconness 4.
