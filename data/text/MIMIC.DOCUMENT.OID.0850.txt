flat in bed in no acute distress.  Neuro:  Alert and oriented
x 3, appropriate.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, II/VI
systolic ejection murmur loudest at the apex.  GI:  Soft,
obese, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Warm and well-perfused, no edema, no
varicosities with good distal pulses.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  WBC 5.7, hematocrit 44.3, platelets 156,
PT 13.0, PTT 26.5, INR 1.1, sodium 137, potassium 3.7,

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As above, the patient was
admitted on 2008-11-04 00:00:00 and proceeded to the Cardiac Cath Lab
showing severe 3VD and was referred for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  He underwent a preop evaluation and was
cleared for CABG and proceeded to the operating room on
2008-11-04 00:00:00 and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4
with Dr. Alsa Marcuccio with a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft
to the OM, left PDA and right PDA.  He was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Room, AV-paced with a rate of 88,
mean arterial pressure of 76, and CVP of 14.  He was
sustained on Neo-Synephrine and propofol drips.  His
underlying rhythm initially was a sinus bradycardia with a
rate in the 30's.

Postoperative day 1 was significant for successful extubation
and return of his heart rate to 62 in a normal sinus rhythm.
On postoperative day 4, the rest of his intravenous
medications were discontinued, and his Foley catheter was
also discontinued, and he was transferred to the inpatient
floor for continued care.

Postoperative day 3 and 4 were also uneventful with heart
rate continuing in sinus rhythm, not requiring any cardiac
pacing.  His pacing wires were thus DC'd, and his usual meds
were resumed.  Mr. Cavalli was followed by the physical
therapy team throughout his recovery, and on 2008-11-04 00:00:00 met
all goals of therapy and was DC'd from a physical therapy
standpoint.

On postoperative day 5, 2008-11-04 00:00:00, Mr. Cavalli was found to
be medically ready for home and was discharged home with
visiting nurses to follow.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs:  Temp 97, pulse 62 in
sinus rhythm, BP 130/__, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 95
percent on room air, weight 95 kg--up from a preoperative
weight of 91 kg.
Physical Exam:  Neuro:  Alert, oriented, nonfocal, moves all
extremities and follows commands.  Pulmonary:  Lungs clear
bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Sternal
incision without drainage or erythema.  Sternum stable and
incision with Steri-Strips.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Warm
with trace edema.  Left leg incision clean and dry.
Endoscopic sites with Steri-Strips.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to home
with visiting nurses to follow.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft x 4.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

History of a gastrointestinal bleed.

Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
.
Depression.

Transient ischemic attacks.

Sleep apnea.

Arthritis.

Gout.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Percocet 5/325, 1-2 tabs po q 4-6 h prn pain.
2. Aspirin 81 mg once daily.
3. Colace 100 mg po once daily.
4. Wellbutrin 150 mg po bid.
5. Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
6. Lasix 20 mg po bid for 7 days, then Lasix 20 mg po once
