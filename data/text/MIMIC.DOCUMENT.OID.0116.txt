Lower extremity exam is antigravity but effort dependent. Moves
spontaneously, but not always to command.
No clonus
Sensation reduced below C7 to light touch
At discharge she had an episode of hypotension which resolved
when in bed to 140/55. According to daughter in law the patient
is always hypotensive baseline.



Pertinent Results:
MR C/T/L spine 2007-05-03 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Edema within the spinal cord at C5-C7, likely due to
contusion secondary to spinal stenosis and trauma with blood
products within the cord consistent with hemorrhagic contusion.
2. Posterior disc bulge and osteophyte complex at multiple
levels, most
severe at C5-C6 with moderate neural foraminal narrowing
bilaterally at C5-C6 as well as moderate posterior disc bulge
and osteophyte formation at C4-C5 and C6-C7 level with mild
neural foraminal stenosis bilaterally at these levels.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine, most
prominent at C4-C5 with disc bulge and facet degenerative
changes causing minimal narrowing of the spinal cord and
indentation of the thecal sac.
4. Posterior soft tissue swelling with no obvious disruption of
the
ligamentum flavum, anterior, posterior spinous ligaments within
the cervical region.Increased signal in interspinous region
without widening of interspinous distance indicates trauma
without disruption.

ECHO 2007-05-03 00:00:00:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Head CT 2007-05-03 00:00:00:
No evidence of SAH.

EEG 2007-05-03 00:00:00:
Normal

Carotid Ultrasound 2007-05-03 00:00:00:
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is moderate heterogeneous plaque in the
bulb/ICA. On the left
there is moderate heterogeneous plaque seen in the bulb/ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 76/21, 56/10, 79/17 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 52 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 100 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA
ratio is 1.5. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 75/20, 85/18, 72/16 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic velocity
is 54 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 67 cm/sec. The
ICA/CCA ratio is
1.6. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

Right antegrade vertebral artery flow.
Left antegrade vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms Hitchman was admitted on 2007-05-03 00:00:00 after sustaining a C5-6
cord contusion and SAH after a syncope fall at home. She was
admitted to the ICU for close observation where her blood
pressure was kept to a MAP of 85 for perfusion. She was placed
in a hard cervical collar. On 2007-05-03 00:00:00 the trauma service
cleared her T and L spine. Repeat head CT was stable and she was
transferred to the floor.

Syncope workup:
 ECHO was negative
 Carotid ultrasound (see report)
 EEG was normal
 Hgb A1c 5.9

PT/OT worked with the patient and recommended rehab placement.

On 2007-05-03 00:00:00 she was discharged to UPMCE Rehab

Discharge Instructions:
??????	No pulling up, lifting more than 15 lbs., or excessive bending
or twisting until your follow-up appointment
??????	Limit your use of stairs to 2-3 times per day.
??????	If you are required to wear one, wear your cervical collar or
back brace as instructed.
??????	Please shower with the cervical collar on. You may remove the
brace off briefly to provide skin care.
??????	Take your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best
if taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness,
and before bed for sleeping discomfort.
??????	Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin,
Advil, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen etc. unless directed by your
doctor.
??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine
(narcotics) can cause constipation. We recommend taking an over
the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while
taking narcotic pain medication.
??????	You 2007-05-03 00:00:00 NOT drive as you are required to wear a cervical
collar. Return to work recommendations will be discussed at your
office visit.
??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no straining, or
excessive bending.
??????	If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or
Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin prior to your injury, please
refrain from taking until cleared by your Neurosurgeon- this
will occur at your follow-up appointment


Followup Instructions:
Please have your occipital sutures removed on 2007-05-03 00:00:00. You may
have this done with your PCP or with our clinic. Please call
test@mail.com to make this appointment.

Please follow-up with Dr Hitchman in 2007-05-03 00:00:00 weeks. You will
not need spinal imaging at that time, but you will need a Head
CT to reassess your head bleed. Please call Paresa to make this
appointment test@mail.com.
