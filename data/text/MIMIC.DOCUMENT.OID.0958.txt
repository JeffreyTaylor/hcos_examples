Chief Complaint:
Right hand weakness and dysarthria - "code stroke"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tPA administration

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Wierzbicki is a 86-year-old right-handed man presenting with
dysarthria and right hand weakness on a background of
collagenous colitis and irregular heart rhythm, coronary artery
disease and numerous other problems.

Mr. Wierzbicki was at home at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1173**] Wierzbicki this morning. He awoke
normally and ate breakfast according to his typical routine. He
then sat down to watch television. He was holding the remote
control in his right hand. On trying to change channel, the
remote control fell out of his hand, which he then noticed that
he could not move. He thinks that his voice became slower and
less clear at about the same time. There was no headache, his
leg was not weak, he could understand and speak, but said that
others found him difficult to understand. The [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1173**] Wierzbicki
staff called his PCP's coverage who noted normal vitals and
recommended coming to the ED.

His functional status: Uses a walker, needs help with washing,
dressing, has meals prepared for him. Cognitive: quite intact.

Review of systems is positive for shortness of breath that has
been present for two years, worse over the last few days and
worse still this morning. He knows that his heart is irregular.
There is no chest pain or recent episode of chest pain. No
recent infections, fever, chills. All other review of systems
negative
except as above.

EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beat and ventricular
premature beat. Left bundle-branch block. Since the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2012-06-14 00:00:00 intra-atrial conduction delay is less
prominent and further intraventricular conduction delay is
present.

CT head: No acute intracranial process. Specifically, there is
no CT
evidence of a large vascular territorial infarction, although
MRI is a more sensitive test to rule out acute ischemia or
infarction, particularly in the setting of extensive chronic
small vessel ischemic disease.

There are scattered, tiny, punctiform calcifications,
superficially located in the sulci of the right cerebral
hemispheres (e.g. 2:12), likely representing old healed
neurocysticercosis.

MRI of head:
1. Numerous bilateral, left greater than right, cortical
infarcts, acute.
2. No evidence of hemorrhage.
3. Moderate atherosclerotic involvement of the vessels of the
head and neck, particularly of the proximal left internal
carotid artery.

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal inferior akinesis and hypokinesis of the inferolateral and
lateral walls. There is milder hypokinesis of the remaining
segments (LVEF = 35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD (LCx distribution). Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Compared with the report of the prior study
(images unavailable for review) of 2012-06-14 00:00:00, LV function has
significantly deteriorated (although on the left ventriculogram
from 2012-06-14 00:00:00 the LV function appears to be similar to today's
echocardiogram).

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Wierzbicki is an 86 year-old right-handed man with a history of
hypertension, CAD s/p stents x 6, cardiac arrhythmia, prostate
cancer with pelvic recurrence and possible metastasis,
collagenous colitis, and dysphagia who developed right upper
extremity weakness (most prominent in the distal extremity) and
dysarthria on the day of admission. He received tPA
approximately 3 hours after the onset of his symptoms. Head CT
did not demonstrate an acute intracranial hemorrhage, but head
MR revealed numerous acute, bilateral, cortical infarcts,
particularly in the area of the left precentral gyrus. The
patient's history and examination were consistent with a
cortical stroke, resulting in a "cortical hand" and mild
dysarthria. Echocardiogram did not demonstrate thrombi,
vegetations, or other masses, though there was moderate regional
LV systolic dysfunction. EKG was notable for atrial and
ventricular premature beats with LBBB, and telemetry revealed
PVCs and runs of ventricular tachycardia. Given the frequent
PVC's and non-sustained Vtach's, cardiology was consulted who
recommended titrating up metoprolol as tolerated and restarting
low dose lisinopril once safe from stroke perspective.  He was
also recommended to maintain K+ > 4.0 and Mg2+ > 2.0.

Due to the bilateral nature of the infarcts and the presence of
cardiac arrhythmias, the stroke was likely caused by
thromboemboli of cardiac origin. There may have been
contributions from hypercoagulability of inflammation
(collagenous colitis) and dehydration.

While hospitalized, the patient underwent swallowing
evaluations, which revealed small amounts of aspiration while
swallowing. As a result, he was kept NPO and received home
medications and enteral nutrition through a Dobhoff tube. After
a follow-up swallowing evaluation suggested advancement to PO
nectar-thick liquids and soft solids, his PO diet was advanced
appropriately, and his Dobhoff tube was removed.

Due to worsened shortness of breath, he also received albuterol
nebulizers q6h prn with improvement in his breathing as well as
furosemide boluses. Per family, his dyspnea has been
long-standing and does not appear to have any clinical
correlates including CXR and O2 saturation.

During his stay, Mr. Wierzbicki dysarthria mostly resolved,
though he continued to have distal right upper extremity
weakness at the level of the wrist and fingers. Given the
bilateral infarcts consistent with embolic strokes, Coumadin was
discussed with family and he was started on Coumadin with
aspirin bridging.  Patient's aspirin should be discontinued once
Coumadin therapeutic with INR > 2.0.  Also, given the Jabrell Bunns, he
was started on low dose Simvastatin 10mg once daily.

Patient was also found to have urinary tract infection on 2012-06-14 00:00:00
and was started on ciprofloxacin.  Given that this is a
complicated UTI, he will be treated with 10 days of ABX. He will
be following up with Dr. Jabrell Bunns (neurologist) as an
outpatient.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
123 Any St.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Stroke - embolic strokes likely from cardiac arrhythmia
Urinary tract infection

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker

Neuro deficit: Patient has unreactive left eye.  Mild dysarthria
and complains of dyspnea but this is chronic.  R hand weakness -

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital as "code stroke" for acutely
weakened right hand and slurring of speech.  Given the acute
presentation and NIHSS score of 4, he received IVtPA and was
initially admitted to the ICU.  His MRI showed multiple,
bihemis123 Any St. strokes likely embolic etiology.  He was monitored
on telemetry which showed multi-focal atrial tachycardia and
PVC's hence cardiology was also consulted who recommended
titrating up metoprolol as tolerated.  Given the embolic
strokes, Coumadin was discussed with the patient and family and
he was started on Coumadin with ASA bridging this admission.
ASA should be discontinued once Coumadin therapeutic (INR 2~3).

He was also found to have urinary tract infection during this
admission and was started on ciprofloxacin 500mg once daily on
2012-06-14 00:00:00.  Patient is returning to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1173**] Wierzbicki where he resided
before admission and will receive physical and occupation
therapy.
