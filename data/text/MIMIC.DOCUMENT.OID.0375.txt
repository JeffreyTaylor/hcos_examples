Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HLP, AAA repair
in past, known prior stage I lung adenoCA (pt of Dr. Latawn Darkes s/p
limited resection 04' with now new RLL lung mass along with
multiple ground glass opacities with new RLL lesion biopsied
showing new squamous cell CA, was admitted for evaluation of
recent progressive sx of night sweats, anorexia, weakness with
decreased ability to care for self.
.
.
# Anorexia, Fatigue, nightsweats, mild DOE
# Eosinophilia
Given the subacute nature of her presentation and climbing
eosinophilia, there was concern for the possibility of fungal
lung infection. Interventional Pulmonary was consulted, and pt
underwent flexible bronchoscopy with biopsies and BAL for micro.
 She tolerated the procedure well, but had a pneumothorax
following the procedure.  A follow up repeat CXR was obtained,
which showed an increase in the size of the pneumothorax, and
therefore Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter to
treat.  Her pneumothorax remained stable with the chest tube in
place, and the chest tube was removed on the day of discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. Latawn Darkes as an outpatient for the
results from the bronchoscopy.
Her serum galactomannan and beta-glucan are negative.  All her
culture data is negative to date, but final results are still
pending.
.
# Lung CA - prior slow progressive adenoCA with now noted new,
more aggressive squammous cell CA.
After d/w Dr. Latawn Darkes, he was concerned about possible
leptomeningeal spread of malignancy given her constellation of
symptoms, and he requested MRI head.  MRI head was performed,
which did not show any e/o malignancy, and specifically did not
show any leptomeningeal disease.  She will follow up as an
outpatient for further evaluation and management of her
malignancy, and follow up of pending bronch biopsies.
.
# Hyponatremia/SIADH
Pt was noted to have hyponatremia on presentation, with sodium
126. Urine studies were obtained, and confirmed the hyponatremia
was consistent with SIADH.  She was placed on 1200 cc fluid
restriction, and her sodium subsequently improved.  She was
discharged with recommendations for ongoing fluid restriction of
1500cc. She should have her sodium rechecked at her next
clinical appointment.
.
# Hypothyroidism - continued home dose synthroid in-house.
.
# HLP - continued home dose lovastatin
.
# HTN
- continued home BP regimen (metoprolol, enalpril, amlodipine).
