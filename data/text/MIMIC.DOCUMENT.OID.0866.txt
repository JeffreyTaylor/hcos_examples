History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old woman, recently hospitalized for C.
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission
hypoxia/hypercarbia (2011-05-12 00:00:00) who presents with respiratory
distress and respiratory failure.
.
The patient had reportedly been doing well in rehab until today
when she was noted to have an altered (depressed) mental status,
tachypnea, and dyspnea.  EMS was called who found the patient in
extremis, intubation was attempted x2 and failed.  Jaysan Meldon Ramseyer airway
was placed and the patient was transported to UPMCE emergency
department.  There were no reports of increased coughing or
stooling from UPMCE Rehab.
.
The patient has had a complicated medical course in the past
month -
.
In brief, the patient was initially discharge on 2011-05-12 00:00:00 after
a 14 hosptilazation for c.diff colitis complicated by sepsis and
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  On the
day following discharge from that admission, the patient was
noted to be complaining of worsening SOB and ABG at UPMCE rehab
was 7.4/73/63. She was re-admitted to UPMCE on 2011-05-12 00:00:00 to the MICU
and intially reuqired biPAP for HD1-2. Her oxygen requirement on
d/c was 2L NC.   The etiology of her hypercarbic respiratory
failure was felt to be 2011-05-12 00:00:00 hypoventilation from somnolence
related to oversedation with zyprexa which was held on
discharge. A CTA chest was negative for PE and showed no clear
evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially started on HCAP
antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were stopped on HD 4 prior
to discharge given that all cultures were negative and there was
no consolidation on imaging.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: HR: 82 BP: 94 systolic Resp: No
spontaneous respirations O(2)Sat: 100;  Initial labs
demonstrated hct 22.0, wbc 16.0, creatinine 0.3, BIN 18, lipase
148 and lactate 0.9. A cxr demonstrated bilateral pleural
effusions with R>L.   A UA demonstrated large leuks, positive
nitrites and 104 wbc.  Due respiratory failure the patient was
intubated.
.
An initial ABG was 7.22/70/128 which was 7.23/62/395 post
intubation.  The patient was given vancomycin and cefepime for
coverage of both a urinary and pulmonary source. Post intubation
her BP dropped to the 50s. She was started on levophed and
phenylephrine through her existing PICC line. Given her altered
mental status on arrival, a head CT was performed which showed
no acute findings. Vitals on transfer were: 36.3 66 118 107/58
99%.
.
Vent settings were: fio2 60% RR 18 Vt 400 peep 5. Sedation with
midazolam and fentanyl. She was transferred on levophed alone w/
MAPs> 70.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  vitals were: 36.2 106/58 77 18 (vented)
100% on 40% FiO2.  The patient was on a levophed drip, was not
sedated, was unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, was
thought to have a brief episode of decerebrate posturing with
the upper extremities.

AP CHEST X-RAY (2011-05-12 00:00:00):
1. Bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left.
Underlying
consolidation cannot be completely excluded.
2. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina.
Recommend
repositioning.
3. NG tube terminates in stomach with sidehole in distal
esophagus.
3. Right PICC terminates in the axilla.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST (2011-05-12 00:00:00): There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, infarction, or mass effect. The ventricles
and sulci are prominent, suggesting age-related involutional
changes or atrophy. Periventricular white matter hypodensities
are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Basal
cisterns appear patent, and there is preservation of Jaysan Meldon-white
matter differentiation. No fracture is identified. There is
fluid within the nasal cavity, likely secondary to intubated
state.  Atherosclerotic mural calcifications of the internal
carotid arteries are present. The visualized paranasal sinuses,
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are otherwise clear.
Bilateral ocular lenses have been replaced. IMPRESSION: No
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

[**Doctor Last Name **] (2011-05-12 00:00:00): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study dated 2011-05-12 00:00:00 (images reviewed),
findings are similar.

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (2011-05-12 00:00:00): Compared to the most recent
study, there is improvement in the mild pulmonary edema and
decrease in the small left pleural effusion. Moderate right
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are stable.

AP UPRIGHT CHEST X-RAY (2011-05-12 00:00:00): Cardiac size is normal. Lines
and tubes are in the standard position. Large right and moderate
left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the
differences in positioning of the patient. Right upper lobe
opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis.
Pleural effusions are associated with atelectasis, larger on the
right side. There is mild vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is an 80 year old woman, recently hospitalized for C.
Difficile sepsis and shock, complicated by readmission
hypoxia/hypercarbia (2011-05-12 00:00:00) p/w hypercarbic respiratory
failure and urinary tract infection.
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Etiology likely
multifactorial, primarily respiratory muscle weakness and pulm
edema with pleural effusions as noted on admission x-ray (has
history of 2+ mitral regurg). She remained intubated for most of
her MICU stay due to pulmonary edema and respiratory muscle
weakness with a poor negative inspiratory force (NIF). Her NIF
gradually improved with optimization of her nutrition and
supportive care. Her pulmonary edema was addressed with
aggressive diuresis with IV and PO Lasix boluses (responds well
to Lasix 10mg IV). With treatment of these issues, she was able
to be successfully extubated to nasal cannula on 2011-05-12 00:00:00. She
was started on Lisinopril 5mg daily for afterload reduction in
setting of her 2+ MR which may have been causing the pulmonary
edema. She may require further PRN doses of Lasix at rehab; if
so would try Lasix 20mg PO PRN. Consider increasing lisinopril
to 10mg for better afterload reduction pressure tolerating.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Patient grew out Pseudomonas sensitive to
everything but Gentamicin on 2011-05-12 00:00:00 urine culture. She was
initially started on double coverage with Cipro/Cefepime while
cultures pending, then narrowed to Cefepime alone, then
broadened to Meropenam per ID recs. There was concern that
Meropenam caused a drug rash so she was then switched to IV
Zosyn. She completed Zosyn course on 2011-05-12 00:00:00, received total of 10
days antibiotics for complicated UTI.
.
# RASH: pt noted to have red macular rash on extremities after
starting meropenam, initially presumed to be meropenam drug rash
so meropenam was stopped. However this was later believed to be
more consistent with contact dermatitis vs. eczema.
Triamcinolone cream was started and rash improved.
.
# C Diff Colitis: Patient was recently admitted for C. diff
colitis with sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during last
hospitalization. She completed her PO vancomycin course on
2011-05-12 00:00:00. Her PO vancomycin was continued during hospitalization
because of concurrent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics
(zosyn) for pseudomonas UTI. Her zosyn was completed on 2011-05-12 00:00:00,
should continued PO vanco until 2011-05-12 00:00:00.
.
# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools during last
admission, new from past admission. Hct stable in high 20s
throughout hospitalization; she did receive one unit pRBC for
colloid pressure support.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily.
.
# GERD: Patient 123 Any St.usly on omeprazole last hospitalization,
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis which was held in
setting of delirium. Famotidine was restarted at 20mg UPMCE once
she was no longer delirious.

# EKG Changes: Patient had lateral STE and mildly elevated
troponin x3 (CK/MB flat)on admission, felt likely due to blunt
injury 2011-05-12 00:00:00 compressions in ED vs. demand ischemia.
.
# A-line: patient had femoral A-line placed in ED in setting of
her hypotension. This was discontinued in ICU and replaced with
PICC. She had one set of BCx which grew Lactobacillus, likely
skin contaminant. Other surveillance cx negative.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Ramseyer,

It was a pleasure participating in your care at UPMCE. You were admitted to the hospital with
respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical
ventilation. This was likely due to a combination of severe
weakness caused by chronic illness, pleural effusions and
pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). You were also found to
have a urinary tract infection causing sepsis (bloodstream
infection), which likely also contributed to your respiratory
failure. You were treated with antibiotics, your symptoms and
breathing improved, and you were successfully extubated on 2011-05-12 00:00:00.
You will be discharged to rehab where you will receive intensive
physical therapy and your nutrition will be optimized to help
you continue regaining strength.
.
When you are discharged from rehab, you will need to follow up
with your primary care Eaton Eaton Ramseyer.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STARTED famotidine 20mg by mouth twice daily for heartburn
2. STARTED triamcinolone acetonide 0.025% cream three times
daily for rash
3. RESTARTED lisinopril 5mg by mouth daily for high blood
pressure and heart failure
4. STARTED docusate (Colace) 100mg by mouth twice daily for
constipation
5. CONTINUED vancomycin oral liquid 125mg by mouth every 6 hours
(last day = 2011-05-12 00:00:00)
6. START lasix po 20mg daily prn volume overload
