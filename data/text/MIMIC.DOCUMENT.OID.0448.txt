Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 52 yo male w/ DM 1, depression admitted for DKA, developed
ARF, gastritis, r/o for MI, now stable.
.
DKA - The pt was placed in an insulin dip and was transferred to
MICU.  In the MICU his sugars came under control and the patient
was eventually transitioned to fixed doses of insulin with a
Humalog SS with Symmonds consult input. His sugars were well
controlled. It remained unclear as to what caused the pt's DKA;
it was felt that he may not have been compliant with his home
regimen 2006-01-09 00:00:00 to depression.
.
Acute on CRI - The patient was found to have an acute increase
in his baseline creatinine thought to arise from dehydration.
His serum creatinine began to decrease with aggressive fluid
hydration.  Nephrology followed the patient. The pt stayed in
the hospital for venous mapping, to help initiate the process of
moving towards HD. He was set up for an appointment with renal
transplant on discharge.
.
CAD/HTN - The pt was found to have EKG changes in the ED with
elevated serum troponin but in the setting of renal failure.  He
ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. He had an
echo that shows a depressed EF from prior echo, but this was in
the setting of an acidosis. Metoprolol was increased to 50mg UPMCE
for better BP control.
.
Depression - Pt appears obviously depressed and expressed little
confidence in medical and psychotherapy. This may have
contributed to his current presentation.  He has tried
medication in the past but did not find them to be helpful. A
psychiatry consult was called who urged the pt to seek o/p
psychiatric help.
.
Coffee Ground Emesis - The pt was found to have gastritis on EGD
but no source of active large bleed.  He was started on a high
dose PPI. He was transfused one unit PRBCs in MICU.
.
Anemia - Per renal, will start procrit [**Numeric Identifier 949**] units 3x/week
