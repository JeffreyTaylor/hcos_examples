MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.3 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.3 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.1 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.23 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the
left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. PFO
is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderate regional
LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta. Focal calcifications in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt
across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior, infero-septal, infero-lateral
hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. LVEF
is around 35-
40 %.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is A paced and on an infusion of phenylephrine
1. Biventricular systolic function is improved.
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
3. Other findings are unchanged

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2005-04-06 00:00:00 11:23 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old man with CAD s/p CABG. and ct removal.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
INDICATION: 56-year-old man with coronary artery disease, status
post CABG and chest tube removal, evaluate for pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: 2005-04-06 00:00:00.

PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Scattered bibasilar subsegmental
atelectasis. There is left retrocardiac opacity which may
represent atelectasis and/or consolidation. Median sternotomy
wires are stable. There has been interval removal of an ET and
NG tubes. A right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter is seen with the tip
in the main pulmonary artery pointing to the right. No
pneumothorax or definite pleural effusions are seen.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
