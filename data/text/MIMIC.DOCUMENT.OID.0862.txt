Attending:Dlana Kufeldt
Chief Complaint:
transfer from UPMCE with rapid atrial rhythm, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a complicated 34 year old woman with hypertrophic
nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, atrial tachyarrhythmias, PVI for
AF complicated by R atrial perforation and  clot in pericardium
with recent VF arrest with prolonged CPR and subsequent
admission to UPMCE 2008-06-16 00:00:00. The patient was discharged to home
on 2008-06-16 00:00:00 and did well for about one week per her report. She then
developed increased lower extremity edema bilaterally as well as
left hand swelling per her report. She felt that she might be
volume overloaded so she presented to UPMCE Hospital on 2008-06-16 00:00:00.
States she was minimally active (using wheelchair/bedside
commode) but she was trying to be as active as possible.

On admission to UPMCE, INR was supratherapeutic 5.8 which
increased to 7.2 on 2008-06-16 00:00:00. She was treated with various
medications (zaroxolyn, lasix IV & PO) for volume overload. CT
of the chest demonstrated large right-sided pleural effusion and
right-sided infiltrate. On 2008-06-16 00:00:00, right-sided thoracentesis was
performed with removal of 1300 cc fluid. Initially treated with
ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, changed to
azithromycin/cefuroxime on 2008-06-16 00:00:00. She was diuresed ~ 5 L in first
3 days. She tells me her breathing felt "improved" after the
Jacklon Gruszka, but increased resp distress noted after thoracentesis
(2008-06-16 00:00:00); she was further diuresed. RUQ ultrasound performed due
to elevation of bilirubin (level unclear) which was benign.
Patient afebrile throughout admission, BPs ranging 90s-120s. HR
typically 40-50s, with brief episodes in the 90s. Weight noted
to be 88.9 kg on admission and 82.1 on transfer. Last BP in
nursing notes documented to be 65/60 with HR 54 prior to
transfer; CCU attending note states patient blood pressure
80s-90s and HR 90-110s prior to transfer. She received 250 cc NS
bolus at 2008-06-16 00:00:00 this evening.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
black stools or red stools. States she hads had cough since
prior admission and small amounts of blood in sputum during
recent UPMCE hospitalization and at home but none since UPMCE
admission. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Cardiac history, compiled from OMR:
Age:
12: Initial presentation with syncope
13: Seen at UPMCE for history of syncope, chest
pain and progressive exercise intolerance; diagnosed with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and underwent catheterization in
which LVEDP was found to be 20. Started on ongoing verapamil
therapy.
16: Cardiac arrest secondary to complex tachycardia,
successfully resuscitated. Repeat catheterization showed left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 36-40 without outflow
tract obstruction. EP showed inducible atrial flutter with a
rapid ventricular blood pressure; dx'ed w/rapid antegrade
conduction and possible pre-excitation. Started on Norpace
(dysopyramide); kept on verapamil and Norpace for many years.
Had occasional palpitations, chest pain and light headedness.
25: Appendicitis during pregnancy, with post-op course
complicated by congestive heart failure, intubated and then
eventually extubated without difficulty; delivered son at 25
weeks.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING  .
EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia with normal axis, which was
signicantly changed from prior EKG showing rapid (rate 100s)
atrial fibrillation (2008-06-16 00:00:00). No ischemic ST-T wave deviations.
Prominent P waves in precordial leads, inverted in V1. Poor R
wave progression.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: pending, sinus bradycardia at OSH

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on 2008-06-16 00:00:00 demonstrated:  The left
and right atria are moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
valvular Jacklon Gruszka or resting LVOT gradient. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2008-06-16 00:00:00, the
magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure have decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 34 year old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
a cardiac history dating back to episodes of syncope at age 12
and her first cardiac arrest at age 16; now admitted for episode
of atrial tachycardia with hypotension, which resolved after IV
fluids.

# Atrial Tachycardia: Ms. Gruszka had tachycardia at the OSH
which was transient.  She is now back in sinus bradycardia,
which is consistent with past episodes of atrial
tachyarrythmias. Although she has had a past chart diagnosis of
WPW there has been no recent evidence of this.  She will go home
on decreased dose of Metoprolol XL 25mg daily. We are holding
verapamil given bradycardia.  She is to continue on home
amiodarone dose.  She will follow up with Dr. Dlana Kufeldt in EP
clinic who will discuss possible Pacemaker placement.  The
patient is refusing pacemaker placement currently.  She is to
continue on home Warfarin dosage.  INR should be followed by PCP
with Jacklon Gruszka in Coumadin as needed.

# CAD/Ischemia: No evidence of ischemia/CAD currently.

# Pump: Ms. Gruszka suffers from severe diastolic heart failure
with preserved systolic function by echocardiogram. She is
pre-load dependent but also susceptible to fluid overload, fluid
balance is therefore delicate.  She was started on
Spironolactone at the OSH and will go home on Spironolactone
12.5mg UPMCE.  She is to continue her home dose of Lasix.  She
will continue with Metoprolol as above

# Valves: Last echo shows no clear valvular dysfunction. She
suffers from Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and is pre-load
dependent.

# Past dyspnea and respiratory distress. She is currently at
baseline O2 reqiurement and appears comfortable. Imaging at OSH
was reviewed with radiology here, there is a mass which likely
represents infection/fluid and is very low probability of
malignancy since it was absent from a recent CT chest.  She will
need follow up imaging to assure that it has resolved.

# Depression: Continue bupropion and sertraline
