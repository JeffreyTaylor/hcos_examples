History of Present Illness:
This 66 year old man has a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and obesity. He has been followed in the 2006-04-04 00:00:00
clinic for quite some time. Over the summer the patient noticed
several episodes of bilateral shoulder discomfort while walking
up a slight incline on the golf course. These episodes would
resolve quickly with rest and then he would be able to continue
on with the rest of his game without symptoms.

Several weeks ago the patient noticed similar bilateral shoulder
discomfort after walking only 100 feet.  He did not experience
any chest discomfort, shortness of breath or other associated
symptoms and again, after several minutes of rest his discomfort
resolved.

He sought consultation with Dr. Laffitte who referred him for
stress testing. He exercised 8.25 minutes of Dequanta Byxbe Laffitte protocol,
reaching 79% of his maximum 123 Any St.ted heart rate. At peak
exercise there was diffuse 2.0-3.0 ST segment depression in the
inferior leads and 1.0-2.0 mm depression in leads I and V3-V6.
The rhythm was sinus with APB??????s and one PVC. Post exercise there
were frequent PVC??????s noted including ventricular bigeminy and
trigeminy. Imaging revealed a mostly reversible perfusion defect
of the septum and apex. A fixed inferior wall defect was also
noted.  LVEF was 48%. He is now referred for cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypercholesterol, basal cell
carcinoma

Social History:
He is a retired owner of an auto radiator
company. He drinks a couple of glasses of beer or wine weekdays.

He does not smoke. He does like to exercise frequently with golf

but finds that quite difficult these days with discomfort. He
rates his pain as 2006-04-04 00:00:00 with activity, 2006-04-04 00:00:00 at rest. It is
predominantly anterior medial.

surgical management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken
to the operating room where he underwent three vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting. Please see operative note for details.

monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He had hypotension requiring pressors.
He was transfused with a unit of packed red blood cells which.
On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down
