Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Pratts was admitted to the MICU from the ER for continuous O2
sat monitoring, IV abx and steroids given the concern for
possible airway compromise.  She was started on all of her home
medications.  A repeat fiberoptic exam was done on the afternoon
of admission which showed a persistent mass/edema in the L
pharyngeal wall to within 1/2 cm from the epiglottis.  An
attempt was made at aspiration of the peritonsillar area which
failed to return any purulent drainage.  She was transferred out
of the MICU on HD 2 as she was clinically improving.  She
received a total of 3 doses of steroids.  On the floor she
continued to improve clinically.  We suggested 24 hours
additional of IV antibiotics but the patient refused.  Given her
refusal to stay and her clinical improvement we have decided on
a discharge plan including 10 days of high dose oral antibiotics
and close follow up.  She will be seen on Wednesday in clinic
and was instructed to immediately return to the ER should she
experience any worsening symptoms.
Patient is being discharged: afebrile, tolerating regular diet
without nausea/vomiting,  voiding, and ambulating well.
