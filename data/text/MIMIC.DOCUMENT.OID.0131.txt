History of Present Illness:
83 yo male with history of hyperlipidema, hypertension,
bifascicular block on 123 Any St.us EKG presented to the ED with
syncope.  The patient was feeling lightheaded this evening.  He
called his daughter to discuss his symptoms.  While he was on
the phone, the line went dead for approx 3min.  He reports he
lost consciousness during that time.  His daughter called EMS.
He denied falling during the episode of LOC.  When EMS arrived,
he was found to be in complete heart block with a ventricular
rate in the 20s.  He was given atropine en route to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T99.0, HR 30, BP 140/60, RR18, o2
100% on NRB.  He was found to be in third degree heart block
with a continued ventricular rate in the 30s.  He was given
atropine again.  He sustained a brief episode of asystole and a
temporary pacer wire was placed.  He had appropriate capture and
was paced at a rate of 80bpm.  He was intubated for airway
protection, given fentanyl and midazolam for sedation, then
changed to propofol prior to transfer.
.
Unable to obtain review of systems secondary to sedation.

EKG:  On admission to the ED, third degree heart block with a
sinus rate of 110 bpm, and ventricular escape rhythm at 22bpm
with right bundle branch morphology, right-UPMCE axis.  On
admission to the CCU, pacer dependent at a rate of 80bpm.
ECG:
High degree A-V block. Again, given the inconsistent
relationship between
P waves and QRS complexes tracing is suggestive of complete
heart block with ventricular or aberrantly conducted nodal
escape rhythm. There is also a rightward axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing #2 evidence for complete heart
block is more clearly seen.

TTE 2013-10-03 00:00:00:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF
60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The aortic valve is not well seen. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2013-10-03 00:00:00, no
major change is evident.

CXR:
FINDINGS: Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker has been inserted,
with leads
intact and in standard positions, ending in the right atrium and
right
ventricle. There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation,
pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Degenerative changes are
noted in the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION: New left-sided pacemaker with leads in standard
positions without evidence of pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Complete Heart Block: The patient had a know history of RBBB
and LAFB. His current presentation was likely degenerative
conduction disease, finally losing his posterior fasicle. He had
no evidence of active ischemia. A TTE showed no focal wall
motion abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers were flat, and ECGs
showed no signs of ischemia.  He was initially emergently
intubated and tranvenously paced. He rapidly extubated and
eventually had a PPM placed with little complication. He
tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home on PO
clindamycin. He will follow up with EP and the device clinic. He
was started on 81mg of aspirin for primary prevention.

#HTN: Not 123 Any St.usly on medical management and remained
normotensive in house. No medications started.

#Hyperlipidemia: Lipid profile at goal when checked in house. No
medications started.

#Prophylaxis: HSC

#Code: Full confirmed

Discharge Instructions:
You had a rhythm problem with your heart called complete heart
block. This was treated with a pacemaker that will regulate the
electrical system of your heart from now on. You did not have a
heart attack. Your echocardiogram showed no significant change
or abnormality. This is a 123 Any St.inary 123 Any St. and will be
reviewed by the attending cardiologist later in the day.
.
Medication changes:
1. Take a baby aspirin 81 mg daily.
2. Take Clindamycin for 3 days, this is an antibiotic that will
prevent an infection at the pacer site.
3. Vicodin: to take for pain at the pacer site or shoulders
.
No lifting more than 5 pounds with your left arm or lifting you
left arm over your head for 6 weeks. Keep the dressing dry, no
showers or baths for 1 week. Do not change the pacer dressing
unless it is damp.
