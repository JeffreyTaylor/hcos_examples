little overall changein the extensive left-sided pneumonia that
involves much of this side of the lung. Widespread
air-bronchograms are again seen. Retrocardiac atelectasis or
consolidation is again noted. Mild blunting of the costophrenic
angles again seen.

CT head from 2010-06-28 00:00:00:  no intracranial pathology

RUQ US fro 2010-06-28 00:00:00:  Coarsened and echogenic liver with probable
focal areas of focal fatty sparing. Please note, while the
appearance is in part due to fatty deposition,more advanced
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded. Clinical correlation is advised and consideration may
be given to MRI if clinically indicated.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of 2010-06-28 00:00:00 4:38 PM
Large consolidation in the left upper and mid lung, consistent
with infectious process appears to be minimally different from
the prior study with no obvious evidence of improvement. There
is unchanged cardiomegaly with small amount of left pleural
effusion that appears to be unchanged as well. The overall
appearance has progressed compared to 2010-06-28 00:00:00. No
ap123 Any St.ble evidence of volume overload is demonstrated. The
findings, although consistent with infectious process might
obscure underlying mass. Followup until resolution is highly
recommended with
reevaluation of the patient in two to four weeks after
com123 Any St.n of antibiotic therapy. If no clinical symptoms of
improvement are present,
evaluation with chest CT, preferably after injection of IV
contrast might be considered to exclude the possibility of
post-obstructive pneumonia.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Bacteremia:  On HOD 1, pt was found to grow g+ rods c/w
clostridium or bacillus.  at this time the ceftriaxone/azithro
which she was started on was d/c'd and she was started on a
course of vanc/zosyn/clinda (for possibility of clostridium
toxin).  Pt was spiking fevers persistently throughout the day
of 2010-06-28 00:00:00(as high as 104.4), and was receiving tylenol and
continous IVF.  By the following morning, her fevers had
improved, but she was significantly hypotensive (SBP in 80s),
and was satting in the low 90s on 4L NC.  At this point a 1L
bolus was started and she was put on a NRB and her O2 responded
well.  BP also came up to SBP 104 after half of her bolus.
However, given the concern for septic shock, a trigger and MICU
consult was called.  Pt was transported to MICU where her
pressures improved with fluids without a pressor requirement.

#. Pneumonia: Initial CXR in ED showed left perihilar opacity
consistent with pna.  with continued fevers, we obtained a
repeat the next evening which showed worsening of her pna to
include upper and lower lobes.  It is unclear at this point
whether the pna was seeded by the bacteremia or a separate
issue.  However, she was being covered for her pna with her
bacteremic management.  Patient transferred to the MICU on 2010-06-28 00:00:00
for hypoxia requiring a nonrebreather.  Vanc and zosyn were
continued and she was able to quickly wean her oxygen
requirements and was transferred back to the floor the next day.
 On the floor pt had a urine culture that was positive for
legionella; after consultation with ID, the pt was switched to
Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for an abiotic course of 10days. This
was completed in the outpat setting. Pt was discharged on home
oxygen while she completed her recover.
.
#AMS:  Per pt report, she had been feeling ill in the days
leading up, and her family says she was not her baseline and
that something was "off".  The pt's change in MS Jeylani Knoell
to her bacteremia.  Her head CT was negative. Jeylani Knoell pt was
mostly A/Ox3 but would occasionally forget the date. She was
mentating well and answered questions, and carried on
conversations.  Even with her episode of hypotension prompting
the MICU transfer on 2010-06-28 00:00:00 she didn't have any acute MS changes.
As she recovered on the floor, her MS continued to improve and
returned to baseline.
.
#. Transaminitis: Unclear etiology but were initially thought to
be related to hypoperfusion state vs. hepatitis or possible
rhabdo given elevated CK.  We ordered hep serologies which were
negative and trended the LFTs which generally improved over time
but findings on US were suggestive of chronic liver diases.
Follow-up was arranged in the outpt setting with a hepatologist.
 Of note, LFT elevations are also common with Streptococcal
pneumonia and legionella; given the positive legionella urine
test this was likely the cause.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure: Pt came in with Cr 1.6, and this began
trending down with hydration.  We believe this was of pre-renal
eitology from likely hypoperfusion state.  We held her Knoell and
thiazide, Cre was improved at the time of transfer out of the
MICU.
.
# Migraine headaches: Patient continued on her amitriptyline but
had positive serum tox for TCAs consistent with chronic overdose
(no signs of toxicity.)  Her home dose was decreased by half.
.
# Hyperglycemia: During admision the pt was found to have high
glucose levels w/ elevated HgA1C 7.8. Outpt follow-up was
arranged with the pt's PCP for further evaluated and managed.
.
Pt was full code during her admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Knoell,
You were admitted to the hospital on 2010-06-28 00:00:00 because you were
having some increased confusion, and you were found to have a
blood-stream infection on admission and severe pneumonia.  You
were given multiple antibiotics to treat this, in addition to
fluids to help keep your blood pressure up.  However, the next
morning your blood pressure and oxygen levels dropped low, and
you were transferred to the intensive care unit for further
management. You improved with supportive oxygen therapy, IV
fluids and continued antibiotics. You were able to be
transferred to the regular medical floor on 2010-06-28 00:00:00 where you
continued to receive antibiotics. Test showed that you had
bacteria in your blood and urine. Bacteria can cause all of the
symptoms that you experienced including fever, cough, pneumonia
and stomach upset. One of the bacteria found (called legionella)
often grows in anything contain old, stagnant water such as an
old air conditioner which you stated that you had. It will be
very important that you get rid of your old air conditioner and
replace it with a new one as the old air conditioner may have
been the source of your infection.
.
Although you initially continued to have fevers and sweating on
antibiotics you tempature slowly returned to 123 Any St. and your
need for supplamentary oxygen decreased. However, because of the
severity of the pneumonia which you had, you will need to remain
on home oxygen for a short time while you finish your
antibiotics and recover. It will be very important that you
complete the entire coures of antibiotics as prescribed to
ensure that the infection is completely treated and your
symptoms do not return. It will also be very important to
follow-up with your PCP (see appointment scheduled below) and to
have a repeat chest xray in 2010-06-28 00:00:00 weeks to ensure that your
pneumonia has resolved.
.
While you were in the hospital, it was found that tests of your
liver function were abnormal and an ultrasound showed changes in
your liver that were suggestive of chronic liver disease. It is
very important the your liver function tests be checked to
ensure that they return to normal. Also, we have scheduled an
appointment for you to see a liver specialist (hepatologist) to
determine why there are these chronic changes seen in your liver
on ultrasound.
.
Also, it was found that you blood sugar was high and a test over
you blood showed that your hemoglobin A1C (which is a measure of
chronic high glucose in your blood) was elevated. This suggests
that you may have abnormally high glucoses levels chronically
which could suggest you might be at risk for diabetes. You will
need to follow-up with your regular doctor to have this further
evaluated and managed.
.
Blood tests also showed that the number of red bloods was low
and that you had anemia. This should be further evalutated by
your regular doctor to ensure that you red blood cell count
returns to normal after you recover from your pneumonia.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
- Start taking Levofloxacin 750 mg daily; please be sure to
complete the entire course of your antibiotic which will end on
2010-06-28 00:00:00 for a total course of 10 days begun on 2010-06-28 00:00:00.
- Stop taking amlodipine; you will need to speak with your
doctor regarding whether or not you should continue taking this
medication.
- Reduce your dose of Amitriptyline 25 mg PO daily instead of
75mg given that your levels were found to be high while in the
hospital; you will need to discuss with your PCP whether to
resume your [** Location **]us dose.
- Stop taking your simvastatin; please discuss with your PCP
whether this can be restarted once your liver function tests are
normal again.
- Please use your home oxygen to ensure that the level of oxygen
in your blood is >93%.
.
Please be sure to take all medication as prescribed.
.
Please be sure to keep all follow-up appointments with your PCP
and liver doctor.
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you a speedy
recovery.



Followup Instructions:
Please be sure to keep all follow-up appointments with your PCP
and liver doctor.
