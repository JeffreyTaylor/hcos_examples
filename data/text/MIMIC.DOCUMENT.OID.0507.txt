Pertinent Results:
2007-10-26 00:00:00 ANGIOGRAM:
1.  Tiny 1-2 mm questionable infundibulum versus questionable
broad-based
focal ectasia versus tiny aneurysms noted at the level of the
anterior
communicating artery and right middle cerebral artery
bifurcation.
2.  Evaluation of the right external carotid artery, left
internal carotid
artery, left external carotid artery, right vertebral artery,
and left
vertebral artery demonstrates no definite evidence of aneurysms
or vascular malformations.


2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
Status post ventriculostomy catheter placement from a right
frontal approach with tip in the third ventricle;
stable-to-slight increase in extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage
with layering intraventricular hemorrhage within the occipital
horns of the lateral ventricles

2007-10-26 00:00:00 ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is moderately dilated and elongated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the
basal-mid inferior wall, and inferior/anterior septum. The LV
apex and distal anterior wall appeared normokinetic, although
their function may be overestimated given significantly
foreshortened apical views. The right ventricle is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR FINDINGS:
As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
been advanced.  The tip of the tube now projects over the
gastroesophageal junction.  To ensure correct position in the
stomach, the tube must be advanced by another 10 cm. Unchanged
position of the endotracheal tube.  Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload.  The extent and severity
of the pre-existing right lower lung parenchymal opacity is
unchanged.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (9:27 AM)
CONCLUSION:
1. Interval increase of the hemorrhage at the mid brain compared
to the 123 Any St.us study, concerning for hemorrhage within the mid
brain versus expanding hemorrhage at the interpeduncular
cistern.
2. Interval increase in the size of the ventricles as described
above,concerning for hydrocephalus.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT UP EXT W/O Study Date (9:27 AM)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Comminuted and impacted right medial clavicle fracture.
2.  Severe emphysema.
3.  Multinodular thyroid can be further evaluated by ultrasound,
if clinically indicated.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of (2:05 PM)
CONCLUSION:
1. The hemorrhage at the midbrain has seems to have increased in
size compared to the study from earlier this morning.
2. There is an increased amount of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
around the catheter site.
3. The size of the ventricles is unchanged compared to the study
performed
earlier this morning.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 PORTABLE HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST (7:45 AM)
CONCLUSION:
1.  Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, unchanged
compared to the 123 Any St.us study.
2.  No new evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute
infarction.
3.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage around the catheter site is
stable compared to the 123 Any St.us study.
4.  Size of the ventricles is unchanged compared to the 123 Any St.us
study.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) (10:22 AM)
IMPRESSION:
AP chest compared to 2007-10-26 00:00:00 through 5: Relatively symmetric
infiltrative abnormality in the lower lungs is probably
pulmonary edema.  123 Any St.us right lower lobe pneumonia is
improving.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is longstanding.  ET tube in
standard placement.  Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the
stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 EKG
Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. Poor R
wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes in the inferior and
anterolateral leads. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2007-10-26 00:00:00
the ventricular response is slower.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (4:42 PM)
IMPRESSION:  No significant change since the prior study.  No
evidence of new hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarction.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) (5:20 PM)
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of 2007-10-26 00:00:00, there is again
substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with only mild elevation
of pulmonary venous pressure.  This suggests cardiomyopathy or
pericardial effusion. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain
in good position.  The
hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, consistent with clearing
of the 123 Any St.us pulmonary edema.  Mild atelectatic changes may
be present.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 Neurophysiology Report EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
due to
generalized slowing of the background activity with 3-5 theta
and superimposed 1-1.5 Hz delta. There are frequent bursts of
generalized sharp waves with maximal amplitude over the frontal
regions often with shifting laterality in terms of maximal
amplitude. These findings are suggestive of moderate to severe
encephalopathy with potential underlying epileptogenic cortex.
Compared to the 123 Any St.us day's study, the generalized sharp
waves are slightly less frequent and now they are more blunted
in their appearance

2007-10-26 00:00:00 Neurophysiology Report EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring
study due to a slow background of 2007-10-26 00:00:00 theta with superimposed
2007-10-26 00:00:00 Hz delta. Frontally
maximal, generalized sharp waves are frequently seen. The
background activity becomes discontinuous after 16:00 to 00:45
with alternating pattern of one to two second severe EEG
suppression and two to three seconds of diffuse 5 Hz theta
predominantly over frontal-central areas, superimposed with 2-3
Hz delta. These finds are suggestive of severe encephalopathy
with potential underlying epileptogenic cortex.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS (10:33 AM)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Improvement/stable subarachnoid and intraventricular
hemorrhage as
described above.
2.  Patent Circle of 123 Any St.. Patent carotid and vertebral
arteries and their major branches with no evidence of stenosis.
3.  Again seen is the small 1- to 2-mm aneurysm at the level of
the ACA and right MCA bifurcation, as seen 123 Any St.usly on the
cerebral angiography from 2007-10-26 00:00:00. No evidence of vasospasm.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT (2:24 PM)
IMPRESSION:  No sonJrew Kochanowski evidence for lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT (5:55 PM)
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date,
there has
been placement of a left subclavian catheter that extends to the
upper-to-mid portion of the SVC.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
The left basilar
opacification is slightly less prominent. Other monitoring and
support devices remain in place.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) (4:08 AM)
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of 2007-10-26 00:00:00, there is
continued prominence of the cardiac silhouette without definite
pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is now increasing
opacification at the right base with poor definition of the
hemidiaphragm.  This suggests pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Less prominent opacification is seen at the left base.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) (4:39 AM)
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 2007-10-26 00:00:00 - Right lower lobe
consolidation has improved.  There is no pulmonary edema.
Moderate cardiomegaly has improved since 2007-10-26 00:00:00.  Pleural
effusions are small on the right, if any.  Configuration of the
diaphragm suggests COPD.
ET tube in standard placement.  Left subclavian line ends at the
junction of brachiocephalic veins and an enteric tube ends in
the upper stomach.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR: FINDINGS:  As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph,
there is constant appearance of the heart and the lung
parenchyma.  No interval appearance of new parenchymal
opacities.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without overt
pulmonary edema.  The monitoring and support devices are
constant.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR: FINDINGS:  As compared to the [** Location **]us radiograph,
there is no relevant change.  Unchanged monitoring and support
devices.  Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma.
Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  No
pneumothorax, no pleural effusions.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Status post tracheostomy and PEG placement, both of
which appear in appropriate position.  Apparent increase in
right pleural effusion is likely due to patient rotation with
respect to the film.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR:
FINDING: Pulmonary vascular congestion with associated
peribronchial cuffing appears unchanged.  When compared to a
similarly positioned radiograph of 2007-10-26 00:00:00 at 4:50
a.m., there has been apparent increase in confluent opacity in
the right infrahilar region.  This area is difficult to compare
to the more recent radiograph of 12:50 p.m. on the same date,
but may be improved since that time.  Differential diagnosis
includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema, aspiration, and less
likely a focal infection.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR:
IMPRESSION: Right-sided pleural effusion, small to moderate in
size.  Otherwise, unchanged examination of the chest.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 BILATERAL LOWER VEIN:
IMPRESSION:  Nonocclusive thrombus within the left common
femoral vein.  The remainder of the veins of both legs are
normal.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION:
1.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt terminating in the frontal Chelsen Ludwinski
of the right lateral ventricle, as compared to within the third
ventricle on prior examination.
2.  New small foci of air within the right frontal Chelsen Ludwinski of the
lateral
ventricle, likely due to recent instrumentation.
3.  Overall, decreased amount and density of [** Location **]usly seen
subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.  No mass effect or
evidence of herniation. Stable ventricular size.
4.  Increased opacification of the right mastoid air cells

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION:  Stable examination
(since 2007-10-26 00:00:00 study)

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR - The ET tube tip is approximately 7 cm above the
carina.  The gastrostomy projecting over the stomach consistent
with feeding tube.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.
Left lower lobe opacity is unchanged, associated with small
amount of pleural effusion concerning for infectious process.
No new abnormalities demonstrated.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR - IMPRESSION:
1.  Left lower lung improved.
2.  Mild pulmonary edema which is more evenly distributed on the
study, but overall unchanged.

2007-10-26 00:00:00 CXR
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of 2007-10-26 00:00:00, the left
hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, raising the possibility of
atelectasis or even developing
consolidation at the left base.  Remainder of the study is
essentially within normal limits and the monitoring and support
devices are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 y/o M on aspirin and coumadin for Afib presents s/p worst
headache of his life with SAH found on head CT. His INR was
elevated to 4 and was actievely reversed with factor 7 and
vitamin K. He was intubated and an EVD was placed in the ED at
the bedside. He was then admitted to neurosurgery and went for
an angiogram for evaluation of aneurysm. Angiogram was negative
for any aneurysm. Post angiogram, the patient on exam withdrew
all four extremities to noxious stimuli. His INR was stable at
1.0.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, patient opened his eyes to voice, but had CN 3, 4 and
6th nerve palsy. He followed simple commands in bilateral hands
and feet. His EVD was elevated to 20cmH2O. The EVD stopped
functioning twice overnight but this was quickly resolved when
flushed.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00 the EVD again stopped working, but the patient remained
neurologically stable. A Head CT revealed a new hemorrhage along
the catheter tract. It was decided to replace the EVD, which was
performed without complication. Post placement CT revealed good
catheter positioning. His dilantin level was subtherapeutic so
he was re-bolused.fluid volume balance - 2 liters negative. The
serum sodium was uptrending so ICU increased intravenous fluids.
The patient stopped moving Left upper and left lower extremity.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, The patient was febrile to 103 with tachycardia to 150s
in Atrial flutter. Femoral Alcius was placed. A diltiazem
continuous IV drip was initiated. The patient was pan cultured.
The External Ventricular Drain was clamped at 5 pm and later
unclamped due to elevated intercranial pressures.  The patient's
EVD was left open at 10 above tragus.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, The external ventricular drain was open at 10 abouve
tragus.  The serum sodium was 155 and the serum BUN was 30.  The
patient's intravenous fluid was increased to NS at 100cc/hr.
The dilantin level was checked and repleted. Per the epilepsy
attending the EEG much improved from teh day prior and there
were no seizures noted.  Recomendations were made to maintain
the Dilantin level higher at 20.On exam, the patient was able to
eye open to voice. The pupils were 5mm and non reactive. Left
ptosis, dysconjugate gaze continued.  The patients left upper
extremity exhibited no movement. The left lower extremity
withdrew to noxious stimulus. The right upper extremity the
patient moves fingers to commands, localizes and moves his right
lower extremity on the bed

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, The EEG without seizures.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, The EEG showed no seizures and was stable consistent
with severe encephalopathy.  The CTA Head showed no vasospasm.(
premedicated with 100 hydrocort/50 bendryl) for decreased exam.
Free water 300 q 6 hours for elevated serum sodium of  152.  The
goal goal serum sodium wa 138-145.  The external ventricular
drain was clamped at 0830 in teh morning and the patient failed
the clamping trial in afternoon when he had a fever.  The
dilantin level was 13.1.  The patientw as febrile to 101.3.
Blood cultures were sent and venous femoral alcius cooling
catheter removed.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, The patient was febrile overnight and CSF was again
sent which was consistent with ***.  On exam, the patient was
slightly improved .  He was wiggling his toes to command.  He
was able to flicker move his right hand fingers to command. The
EVD open at 20.  The Transcranial Doppler study was limited due
to EEG leads placement but there was no vasospasm of
opthalmic/vertebral or extracranial carotid arteries.  The serum
sodium was elevated at 151 and at 1730 the serum sodium was up
to 153. The free water flushes were increased to 360 cc q 6
hours.Late morning the patient's fever was 102.8 and a Chest XRY
was consistent with a new right sided consolidation. A
Bronchcoscopy was performed and a BAL was sent. IV abts
vancomycin and cefipime was initiated for pneumonia. A EEG
showed no seizures but consistent severe encephalopathy. Per the
epilepsy service as there had been no seizures noted on EEG the
EEG was discontinued. On exam ,the patient opened eyes to voice.
 The right pupil was 5-4.5mm reactive and the left pupil 5mm NR.
 The Right Upper Extremity exhibited flicker finger movement to
command and was casted.  The patient moved toes bilaterally to
command/briskly.  There was no movement in the left upper
extremity which was stable.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00, patient was seen to have a stable examination, he was
following simple commands on his RLE, w/d RUE, spontaneous on
the LLE and no movement on his LUE. He was febrile throughout
the day and was cooled with a cooling blanket. His Na increased
from 151 to 153, free water was increased. His vancomycin was
also increased to 1250mg QD. He was placed on a dilt gtt for
a-fib and was being converted to PO. He was recultured for his
fevers. U/A was negative.
On 2007-10-26 00:00:00 he was again febrile. Sputum Cultures from the 11th
including a BAL were positive for staph and yeast.  WBC cont to
increase to 24.3. Na was stable at 150 and dilantin was
corrected to 10.8. An MRI/MRA were ordered to evaluate for
vascular malformation and prognostication. A family meeting was
scheduled for 2007-10-26 00:00:00 but Dr Chelsen Ludwinski met with the patient's daughter
in advance and Dr Jrew Kochanowski spoke to the patient's wife on the
phone. Everyone was in agreement that they would like to proceed
with a trach and peg. This was scheduled for 2007-10-26 00:00:00.
Overnight he was febrile and was suddenly hypotensive to the
60s. He required Neo for a short while but this was then weaned
off. CSF was sent for culture. In the AM 2007-10-26 00:00:00 he was
neurologically stable. His trach and peg were placed at the
bedside.

On 2007-10-26 00:00:00 patient developed fevers again and his scheduled VPS
procedure was posponed. VPS placement was accomplished on 2007-10-26 00:00:00.

The patient was seen 2007-10-26 00:00:00: restarted FW bolus, thick
secretions-febilre 103 right after PICC, central line removed,
blood/sputum sent, sputum resulted in GPC in clusters with
sensitivities pending.  Over the course of the 2007-10-26 00:00:00, the
patient spiked fevers on a nightly basis for which Vancomycin
was restarted, and tailored for supratheraputic value.
Hypernatremia was noted to improve over this time on Free Water
flush (149-146-141 over the course of 2007-10-26 00:00:00 days).  Lovenox was
also restarted for DVT with a coumadin bridge both for DVT and
AFib history.

A VPS tap resulted in the findings of a leukocytosis in the CSF
(100 WBC with 89 neutro) without any organisms seen, and normal
protein/glucose.  ID was consulted regarding the patients
continued fevers, with recommendation to continue Vanco for
total course of 2007-10-26 00:00:00 days given [** Location **]us Cx of GPC x2 from
sputum.  Over 2007-10-26 00:00:00 evening patient remained afebrile with
decreasing serum leukocytosis.

Spoke with Orthopedics regarding right cast, which had been
placed in 2007-10-26 00:00:00 s/p an ORIF procedure for MVA-related
fracture.  Plan to remove the cast on 2007-10-26 00:00:00 with repeat XRays.

Patient remained afebrile and stable from a respiratory and
neurological standpoint. He was discharged to rehab on 2007-10-26 00:00:00.
