Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o M with a history of 123 Any St. Gastaut Syndrome who is
nonverbal at baseline who presents with fever and associated
vomiting for 1 day and a leukocytosis, with exam, oxygen
requirement, and imaging consistent with health-care associated
pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia: Patient presented with fever to 101 and
leukocytosis with a CXR consistent with left base consolidation
and a new supplemental O2 requirement. Was found to be
hypotensive in the ED, although volume responsive and was
normotensive on arrival to the MICU. Although a nursing home
resident, he was initially covered in the ED with vanco,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and he defervesced overnight and
so was continued on this regimen at the time of transfer to the
regular floors. Blood cultures drawn in the ED prior to
antibiotics were negative. On the floor, pt had fever to 100.8
and was broadened to vancomcyin, zosyn and azithromycin. He lost
IV access and was briefly transitioned to PO regimen with
linezolid, flagyl, and levofloxacin.  He did well for >36 hours
with no fever or leukocytosis on this oral regimen so decision
was made to contiune treatment on oral antibiotics to be
completed at home.  Repeat CXR in 2006-12-21 00:00:00 weeks recommended to
ensure complete resolution.

2.  123 Any St. Gastaut Syndrome: At best pt has 2006-12-21 00:00:00 sz/wk and can

seizures during hospitalization.

positive stools during admission, however Hct stable throughout
hospitalization. On ferrous sulfate TID usually, but was changed

pills crushed in ice cream or applesauce, at the time of
discharge he was tolerating his diet well
