Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF MICU COURSE:
The patient was placed on a PPI gtt in the ED and transferred to
the ICU. Once in the ICU, he underwent EGD by GI, during which
an ulcerated lesion was noted. Attempts to inject the lesion
with epinephrine resulted in significant bleeding. Ultimately
the bleeding was stopped and the EGD was halted. The patient was
given 2 units of blood at that time. CT scan was ordered, which
showed this known GI mass but no other masses. He continued to
have a falling hematocrit and was transfused additional units of
blood. On 2010-08-03 00:00:00, he had episode of unresponsiveness and
hypotension. During this time, he was intubated and a CVL was
placed. GI scoped him and saw fresh blood and clot with nothing
to intervene upon. On 2010-08-03 00:00:00, he vomited blood again and was thus
taken to the OR for operative exploration.

During the operation, no mass was palpable through the stomach
wall, a long gastrotomy was made and a bleeding ulcer noted
along the lesser curvature, which was then oversewn providing
hemostasis. An NG tube was left in the stomach and the patient
was brought to the SICU for further care.  Patient's
postoperative course in the ICU was uneventful.  His NGT
remained in place and serial HCT was monitored.  Patient was
deemed stable, extubated, and transferred to a regular nursing
floor on 2010-08-03 00:00:00.

BRIEF FLOOR COURSE:
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient remained stable and
continued to improve clinically.
Neuro: The patient received IV dilaudid as needed with good
effect and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake,
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint
on metoprolol and lisonpril; vital signs were routinely
monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Diet continued to be advanced as appropriate, which
was well tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when
necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection and required no
intervention while on the floor.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
