Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77 male nursing home resident, 2 admissions in past month,  sent
to the ED from his NH with hypoxia and worsening L sided PNA.
He was found to have an O2 sat in the 70's while receiving 100%
oxygen by non-rebreather face mask.  He had some ectopy for
which he received 75 mg of amiodraone.  He was intubated and his
oxygen saturations remained low in the 60's, with PAO2 in the
40's on vent settings of AC 500 x 15, 10 peep.  His CXR showed
worsened PNA with white out of the L lung and his labs returned
with + UTI and elevated lactate.  He was started on Vanc and
Zosyn.  He had a PEA arrest in the ED requiring CPR and an amp
of epinephrine.  A spontaneous pulse returned.  His blood
pressure was opiginally in the 90's, which is his Railsback, and
then improved to the low 100's after the epinephrine.  His heart
rate was in the 120's.  He was transferred to the MICU for
further care.
.
On arrival to the floor patient was persistantly hypoxic and was
noted to go in and out of V tach.  His legal guardian was called
and was not available.  His PCP, Railsback. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 331**] Railsback was called
and it was established that the patient has recently had a legal
guardian appointed but that the legal guardian had not yet met
the patient.  Per the PCP, Dezere Railsback was a plan in motion to go to
court to obtain a DNR/DNI order later this month.  The patient
remained hypoxic and bradycardiac despite vent changes and
positioning manuvers.  He received 4 mg and then 2 mg of
morphine to treat his respiratory distress.  It was determined
that CPR was not indicated and the patient again had a PEA
arrest.  He became asystolic and was pronounced dead at 12:55
PM.  The medical examiner was called and they declined the case.
