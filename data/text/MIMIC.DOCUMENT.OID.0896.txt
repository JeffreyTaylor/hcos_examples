3. Small right pleural effusion.

LE Dopplers:
IMPRESSION: No right lower extremity DVT. Right peroneal veins
not
visualized.

CXR:IMPRESSION:
Congestive heart failure with interstitial edema and small
pleural effusions.

Asymmetrical right perihilar airspace opacity which could
reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but co-existing pneumonia
is also possible particularly in the right lower lobe. Followup
radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.

The MICU team reviewed this with radiology who did not feel this
represented a pneumonia.

Urine culture is negative.
Blood cultures are pending - negative thus far.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Bou is a 74 y/o female with a history of COPD, dCHF, CAD
s/p MI in 2005-10-22 00:00:00 who presents with intermittent confusion x 2 days
and shortness on breath since the night PTA.  She was 89% on RA
on arrival and was placed a BIPAP and treated for a possible
COPD exacerbation or pneumonia with steroids and antibiotics and
nebulizers with rapid improvement.  By the time she arrived to
the ICU, she was on 6L and was weaned down overnight.  Due to a
lactic acidosis, she received IVF with resolution.  It is
unclear what the lactic acidosis was due to.  The patient has a
hx of CHF exacerbations and her family was initially concerned
that she was in decompensated CHF.  The patient's BNP ws
elevated upon admission to > 17,000 but the ICU team did not
feel that she appeared volume overloaded at the time.  The
patient did not worsen with IVF.
.
# Shortness of Breath: It is not entirely clear what the primary
cause of her shortness of breath was.  However, she has multiple
possible reasons including COPD exacerbation vs CHF exacerbation
vs pneumonia. Her original X-ray showed a potential LLL
infilatrate however after repeat imaging there was no infiltrate
noted. Her BNP was noted to be >[**Numeric Identifier 6009**] however she had no
evidence of volume overload and with an elevated lactate
diuresis was not initiated. She was started on Vanc and
Levofloxacin and given prednisone burst.  Antibiotics were
narrowed to levofloxacin upon transfer to the floor for empiric
coverage in a COPD exacerbation and the patient was restarted on
her home regiment. Her oxygen was weaned off.  She should follow
up for formal PFTs. 123 Any St.one will be prescribed for a total 5
day course with 5 days of levofloxacin.
.
# Lactic Acidosis: Unclear etiology at this point. There does
not appear to be any evidence of hypoperfusion based on history.
Other potential causes include medication effects and liver
disease. Lactate normalized with fluids.  RUQ US showed a normal
liver and LFTs were normal.
.
# Altered Mental Status: She was alert and oriented upon
presentation and was able to complete concentration tasks. Her
mental status appeared to be at baseline througout her course.
Her initial confusion may have been due to hypoxia.
.
# COPD: It is unclear how severe her COPD is however she had not
been responding to her home nebulizer treatment. She should
follow up for PFTs.  she was discharged to complete a total 5
day course of prednisone.
.
# diastolic CHF: Her last ECHO was on 2005-10-22 00:00:00 which showed a
preserved EF. Her BNP on admission was >[**Numeric Identifier 6009**] however BUN and
creatinine were withing normal limits. She did not appear to be
volume overloaded on exam on presentation and with elevated
lactate was given fluids instead.  When she stabilized, she was
diursed with IV lasix until she was weaned off oxygen.
.
# DM2: She is insulin dependent and appears to be doing well on
her current regimen
She was continued on Lantus 30U qhs with a Lispro SS.
.
# Hypertension: Her blood pressures were elevated when she first
presented. Her BB and ACEI were held initially given the
elevated lactate but were restarted when her lactate normalized.
.
# CAD -patient had been on aspirin but it was discontinued due
to bleeding and thrombocytopenia.  We continued to hold it. She
was continued on her BB, statin, and Imdur. She has mildly
positive troponins in the setting of tachycardia which was
likely 2005-10-22 00:00:00 demand ischemia.  She had no acute EKG changes or
chest pain.
.
# Stage III CKD: Her baseline creatinine appears to be around
1.6 to 1.7.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology however is a long standing
issue that the patient had not followed up. The patient was
discussed with hematology who recommended iron studies,
rechecking B12 and folate (which were normal) and a peripheral
smear.  There were no dysmorphic features but she likely has
some evidence of megaloblastic maturation with an elevated MCV.
She may need a bone marrow biopsy in the future.  Her PCP's
office will schedule followup.
.
# ?Parkinsonism: Patient has a history of some tremors and plans
to follow up with neurology as an outpatient.  She was
neurologically intact here with the exception of some peripheral
neuropathy and did not have any tremors.
