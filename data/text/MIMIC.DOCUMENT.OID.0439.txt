.
2007-11-23 00:00:00 TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
2007-11-23 00:00:00 CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. Widespread ground-glass attenuation likely represents
pulmonary edema as reported on serial chest radiographs, but
superimposed asymmetrical foci of consolidation in the lower
lobes and 2 small nodules raises the concern for coexisting
pulmonary infection.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and anasarca.
3. Over distention of endotracheal tube cuff.
.
2007-11-23 00:00:00 Liver/Gallbladder US: No evidence of a distended
gallbladder to suggest cholecystitis. However, gallbladder is
not well visualized; likely contracted. No history of
cholecystectomy could be elicited from CareWeb. Dr. Birks was
paged to discuss these findings at 1:45 p.m.
.
2007-11-23 00:00:00 MRI Head:IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the large right frontal
intraparenchymal
hematoma, 3.8x3.4cm subacute in stage with surrounding edema,
peripheral
nodular hyperintense areas and mild mass effect on the frontal
Kashanna Limoncelli of the
right lateral ventricle.
2. No new hemorrhage or acute infarction.
3. Patent major intracranial arteries without focal
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm
within the resolution of MR angiogram.
4. Diminutive right distal vertebral artery, likely related to
hypoplasia or normal variant (effective PICA termination); left
fetal PCA.
5. Moderate amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on both
sides and small amount in the left side of the sphenoid sinus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD, anorexia and
alcohol use in past), ileostomy, GERD with delayed gastric
emptying, who presented to UPMCE on 2007-11-23 00:00:00 with nausea
and dizziness. There she was initially dx'd with dehydration,
ARF and UTI but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and of AST
11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0. She was
transferred to UPMCE.
.
She had been having fevers for ~10 days. On 2007-11-23 00:00:00 she went to her
PCP who diagnosed Dawnyel Birks UTI (grew klebsiella) and was taking
Bactrim. She continued to have general malaise and fevers
despite bactrim and asa. On 2007-11-23 00:00:00 she called her PCP who
recommended some tylenol. Per husbands report she took 650mg x2
before coming in to the ED on 2007-11-23 00:00:00. There she was initially dx'd
with dehydration, ARF and UTI. She was given home doses of
simvastatin and SSRIs, but then found to have ALT of 25,370 and
of AST 11,490, total bili of 2.0, INR of 4.0, Cr of 3.0. She was
transferred to UPMCE. On presentation initial vs were: 97.5 P89,
112/37 19 99%RA 37kg.
.
Initially the patient was treated in the MICU. She was thought
to be in hyperacute fulminant liver failure either secondary to
Bactrim reaction versus acetaminophen toxicity - tylenol level
peaked at 10.0 >24 hrs after last ingestion. She became
progressively obtunded, with significant encephalopathy
requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Her liver function
was notable for transaminases with an ALT and AST of 9500 and
17,500 respectively and worsening hyperbilirubinemia. She became
progressively more coagulopathic, and it was thought that she
was most likely going to need orthotopic liver transplantation
for survival. She was transfered to the SICU and transplant
team. Her liver function spontaneously improved over the course
of 2 weeks. This was evidenced by progressive ability to
metabolize her lactate, stabilization of her blood sugars, and
autocorrection of her coagulopathy.
.
During her stay in the SICU, she required respiratory
ventilation, vasopressors for hypotension and intracranial
pressure monitoring. The patient initially had blood pressure
support with the use of vasopressors in order to minimize her
intravascular volume which was thought to exacerbate her
cerebral edema. The vasopressors were weaned by ICU day 6, and
there was no further requirement for this.
.
Given the concern for hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema,
ICP was initiated. Hypertonic saline and mannitol were used for
aggressive volme managment. Her ICPs had climbed into the high
30s, which improved with treatment. Her sedation and paralytics
were weaned. She had removal of her intracranial bolt on 2007-11-23 00:00:00, 2007-11-23 00:00:00, and it was noted on subsequent imaging that she had
approximately a 4-cm, right frontal, intracranial hemorrhage.
This was followed serially with CT scans and there was no
progression of the bleeding. The bleeding was thought to be
secondary to her severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia in the
setting of her instrumentation. She was started on Keppra for
seizureprophylaxis to finish a 10-day course.
.
In terms of her respiratory status, it is noted that the patient
required full ventilatory support with hypoxic respiratory
failure. She was found to have ARDS. She was extubated on
2007-11-23 00:00:00. She initially did well, but, secondary to what
was thought to be pulmonary edema, required reintubation on
2007-11-23 00:00:00 after failure of noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation. She had some degree of what appeared to be an
ARDS-type reaction or transfusion-associated lung injury.
.
The patient also spiked fevers intermittenly starting 2007-11-23 00:00:00. She
was on Vancomycin fom 2007-11-23 00:00:00 for ppx with bold placement. Zosyn
was added for the concern for PNA when she spiked fevers and had
a leukocytosis. Pan cultures were negative. She then developed a
drug rash leading to the discontinuation of Vanc and Zosyn on
2007-11-23 00:00:00. Cipro was started in lieu of Zosyn but was discontinued
on 2007-11-23 00:00:00
.
The patient was transferred to the floor on 2007-11-23 00:00:00 and did
well. Cr is gradually trending down. Keppra was stopped on 2007-11-23 00:00:00
2007-11-23 00:00:00 rise in LFT's. Since that time, LFT's continue to trend
down. The patient's outstanding issues include:
.
1 Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: s/p bolt removal with
thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy 2007-11-23 00:00:00 liver failure. Stable on
MRI 2007-11-23 00:00:00. Pt's aphasia likely 2007-11-23 00:00:00 bleed. EEG from 2007-11-23 00:00:00
without epileptiform activity, consistent with encephalitis and
focal findings consistent with intraparenchymal bleed. Keppra
d/c'd 2007-11-23 00:00:00 with rise in LFT's thought to possibly be 2007-11-23 00:00:00 drug
rxn. She has had no evidence of seizure activity and is
currently off seizure prophylaxis. Pt's ability to communicate
and respond to commands seems to be improving daily. Pt failed
video swallow 2007-11-23 00:00:00. However, she was re-evaluated on 2007-11-23 00:00:00
prior to transfer and she was found to be safe to take teaspoon
trials of nectar thick liquids and pureed food. Will plan to
continue tube feeds for nutrition at this time. She has been
working with PT and OT at time of transfer. She will have neuro
follow up as below after discharge.
.
# ARF- Possibly 2007-11-23 00:00:00 AIN from Bactrim/ tylenol possibly with ATN
component. Cr today continues to trend down at 1.5 prior to
transfer. Of note, nephrology thinks that her ongoing acidosis
is likely related to her liver pathology and does not think
bicarbonate should be used to correct this. At transfer, her
bicarb is 12. Renal team thinks that this should correct itself
as her kidneys recover. Her lytes should be monitored daily. We
recommend she continue on NS at 75 cc/hr for now.
- Continue IVF with NS at 75cc/hour
.
# Respiratory failure- stable since extubation 2007-11-23 00:00:00.
.
# Hepatic failure- LFT's leveling off. Amylase and Lipase are
trending down so continuing TF. With pt's Eosinophilia, it seems
that drug allergy to keppra could very well have been causing
rise in LFTs seen on 2007-11-23 00:00:00. Lactulose is being continued UPMCE PRN
to help clear her sensorium and assist with constipation. We
recommend the facility to which she is being discharged continue
to trend LFTs daily for now.  She will have outpatient
hepatology follow up as below.
- Trend LFTs Daily
.
# Fevers- currently resolved, afebrile since transfer to the
floor. S/p tx with zosyn. No infectious source found on bronch
or LP in MICU. Pt now without foley but incontinence also a risk
factor for UTI. However, pt currently afebrile with WBC 11.1.
.
# Thrombocytosis: Plt very slowly trending down at 906 at time
of transfer. Likely due to reactive physiology.
.
# Drug Rash: Drug rash per derm thought to be most likely 2007-11-23 00:00:00
Zosyn but Vanc or fluconazole also possible. Now pt with
exfoliation of whole body. Skin underneath intact.
.
# Anemia: Stable at 22.9 on day of discharge. iron/ TIBC ratio
17% indicating mild iron deficiency. Will continue iron
supplementation.
.
# Sacral decub: Pt with sacral decub developed in house. She was
seen on the day of discharge by wound care. Please see attached
note from wound care about recommended dressing. Pt should be
followed by wound care specialists as an outpatient.
.
FEN- TF at 30 cc/hr. We would recommend that pt continue IVF, NS
at 75cc/hour until she is better able to take in PO volume.
Also, she is currently cleared to take nectar thick liquids and
pureed foods in teaspoon trials.
Access- right PICC
PPX- lansoprazole, no anticoagulation with h/o intraparenchymal
bleed.
Code- Full

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with liver failure. We are unsure of the exact
cause of your liver failure at this time but we think it was a
reaction to the tylenol and bactrim you had been taking. While
you were here you also had kidney failure. You recieved dialysis
for this but you no longer need this and your kidney function is
returning to normal. In addition, you had increased pressure in
your brain from your liver failure while you were here. This
required a bolt placement in your head to monitor your pressure.
 After this was removed, it was noticed that you had a bleed
into your brain. This bleed has been stable for 2 weeks. You
will need extensive physical and occupational therapy at rehab.
.
Please keep all your follow up appointments as below.
.
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills,
nausea, vomitting, yellowing of your skin or eyes, blood in your
urine or any other concerning symptoms, please call your doctor
or return to the ED.
