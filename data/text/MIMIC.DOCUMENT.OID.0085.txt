Admission Date:  2006-08-15 00:00:00     [**Year (4 digits) 955**] Date:  2006-08-15 00:00:00

Date of Birth: 1928-06-07 00:00:00 00:00:00     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
female with an extremely complicated past medical history
including coronary artery bypass graft times four, atrial
ventricular valve replacement in 2006-08-15 00:00:00, and a 123 Any St.itously
difficult postoperative course.  The patient has never been
weaned from her ventilator and has had multiple ventilator
associated pneumonias, particularly most recently with
pseudomonas Serratia and Klebsiella.  The patient has end
stage renal disease and history of gastrointestinal bleed
secondary to gastritis and esophagitis.

Most recently, the patient was discharged from this hospital
to rehabilitation in early 2006-08-15 00:00:00 only to come back with
fevers and ultimately grew out Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus wound infection requiring debridement
on 2006-08-15 00:00:00.  The patient returned to rehabilitation
2006-08-15 00:00:00, where she sustained a pulmonary embolus arrest,
received Epinephrine and electrical conversion.  The patient
was noted to have decreased responsiveness post code
attributed to anoxic brain injury per neurology.  She was
transferred back to UPMCE Rehabilitation where she
underwent vigorous physical therapy.

On 2006-08-15 00:00:00, per family she had a fever of 103 with culture
peripherally and from her dialysis catheter.  Both grew out
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
started on a course of Vancomycin with only low grade
temperature.  She became lethargic on 2006-08-15 00:00:00, and was
unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension, systolic
blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient briefly improved
postdialysis on 2006-08-15 00:00:00, as did her mental status, but then
became increasingly lethargic with heart beats in the 130s,
blood pressure 80 over palpable, and was transferred over to
UPMCE for further management.

On arrival, the patient was noted to be extremely febrile,
hypotensive, tachypneic.  The patient received an A line and
right internal jugular central line for monitoring and fluid
resuscitation.  The patient's course was complicated by her
poor toleration of hemodialysis secondary to hypotension and
was started on pressors of Levophed and ultimately required
an addition of vasopressor.  The patient was becoming
increasingly somnolent and had not defervesced at this time
despite the addition of multiple antibiotic therapy, Flagyl,
Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Tobramycin.

CT of the abdomen and chest showed no frank abscess or fluid
collection.  Flagyl was ultimately discontinued as decreased
probability of anaerobic infection.  Cultures at outside
hospital showed multidrug resistant organisms including
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Transesophageal
echocardiogram was obtained to rule out endocarditis and it
was negative showing ejection fraction of 55%.  Left Hickman
catheter with UPMCE as probable source of infection.
Foley was placed at this time.  The patient was anuric yet
10cc of purulent material was noted.  The patient was now
growing gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters from two
different sites, the Hickman and/or [** Location **]us PICC line.  She
was increasing her pressor requirement and was hypotensive
despite two liters of fluid.

She was started on Dopamine in addition to her Levophed and
vasopressors. Throughout the day, the patient's systolic
blood pressure decreased to the 80/30.  By 2006-08-15 00:00:00, she was
back on EC vent control.  The patient was noted at 3:43 a.m.
on 2006-08-15 00:00:00, to have an episode of asystole.  The family was
at bedside as well throughout the night.  The pupils were
noted to be fixed and dilated and unresponsive.  Ventilation
was discontinued and spontaneous respirations were not
observed.  The patient was declared dead at 3:43 a.m. The
family declined autopsy.
