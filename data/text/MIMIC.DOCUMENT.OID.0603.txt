Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an OSH after an Abd CT scan
revealed free air and fluid within her pelvis without a clear
source of perforation.  She was initially admitted to the trauma
ICU, but was taken emergently to the operating room on 2013-11-27 00:00:00, 2013-11-27 00:00:00 where she underwent a Hartmann's resection of the
sigmoid colon and end colostomy with Hartmann's pouch; please
see operative report for further details.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the ICU.  She
was extubated and transitionted to IV dilaudid for pain control
with continued intravenous metronidazole and meropenem.  Her NGT
was discontinued and po medications were initiated.  Given
hemodynamic stability, she was transferred to the general
surgical UPMCE on 2013-11-27 00:00:00 POD2 for further management.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout her
hospitalization; post-extubation, pain was initially managed
with intravenous hydromorphone.  This was transitioned to oral
oxycodone and acetaminophen on POD5 with well controlled pain.
Of note, the patient did occasionally require intravenous
morphine for breakthrough pain control.
CV: Upon transfer from the OSH, the patient was noted to be in a
fib with intermittent RVR.  Oral metoprolol was resumed on POD1
and a cardiology consult was obtained on POD4 with
recommendations for anticoagulation with either heparin gtt or
lovenox bridged to oral warfarin or to begin anticoagulation
with dabigatran.  2013-11-27 00:00:00, possible cardioversion either as
an in/outpatient was suggested; anticoagulation not resumed at
this time as per surgeon due to very high risk for falls.  The
patient remained asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable,
therefore, inpatient cardioversion was not attempted.  She will
follow-up with her primary care provider upon discharge for
ongoing management of these issues. She was not started on
anticoagulation, outside of subcutaneous heparin, because of
fall risk and the thought that her irregular heart rate was a
post-surgical response. This will be reassessed when she follows
up in ACS clinic and with her PCP. Fransisco Landolt, the patient
presented with a tunneled line in place for outpatient citoxan,
which was noted to be out of position on POD2, requiring IR
removal and replacement. Pulmonary:   The patient remained
intubated post-operatively due to difficulty with initial
intubation for surgery.  Given respiratory stability she was
extubated on POD1.  She remained stable until POD6 when she
developed acute SOB.  A CXR was obtained and suggested
'unchanged left lower lung collapse and improved bilateral
pleural effusions'. The event did not recur and the patient
remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout hospitalization. Patient has history of diastolic
heart failure, chronic, that was monitored throughout this
hospitalization and she ahd no acute issues realted to her heart
failure.
GI/GU/FEN:  Bowel function returned by POD3 as noted by gas/
stool within the ostomy appliance.  The patient received
teaching regarding ostomy care including emptying pouch and
changing the appliance from the Ostomy RN.  However, her ability
to perform these tasks was limited by her hand deformities.
Occupational therapy was consulted for further assistance and
will continue at the rehab facility.  She was initially NPO, but
was advanced sequentially following return of bowel function to
diabetic diet, which was well tolerated. Nutrition was consulted
due to multiple bilateral chronic lower extremity ulcerations;
recommendations included high protein supplements and food
choices.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored
with electrolyte re123 Any St.n prn. She was taking adequate food and
had gppd output through her ostomy.
ID: Intravenous metronidazole and meropenem were initiated and
continued through POD2 & POD7, respectively. On POD 7, the
patient's WBC began trending upward, therefore, blood cultures
were sent and an CT Torso was obtained and her antibiotics were
switched to vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole; results from CT
scan showed small amount of free fluid in the pelvis but no
signs of abscess and otherwise normal CT.  On POD 8, the WBC
began trending downward and on POD 9 patient was kept on only
diflucan with a planned 5 day course for what appeared per derm
and rheum to be a yeast infection on her back. She was
discharged on no antibioics as she had finished her course of
diflucan and her back rash was much improved. At time of
discharge her blood cultures had no growth to date. She has a JP
drain on her left side that has been draining minimal amout of
serous fluid but will be left in until follow-up appointment.
She also has staples in her abdominal wound that will be left in
until her follow-up appointment with ACS clinic.
Rheum: No acute change in managment of RA while inpatient,
patient will follow up with her outpatient rheumatologist Dr
123 Any St.sone, at home dosage, was continued while
in-house.  Landolt, on POD8, a large rash was noted on the
patients back.  Rheumatology felt this was fungal in nature and
recommended topical antifungal treatment with derm consultation
who also agreed with antifungal treatment.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay; she was encouraged to get out of bed as ealry as
possible.
Rehab: The patient was seen by physical therapy for in-patient
evaluation and treatment. PT recommended transfer to rehab upon
discharge due to the level of assistance required in addition to
pt living at home alone; see evaluation for details. At the time
of discharge to rehab, the patient was doing well, afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a diabetic diet,
ambulating with assistance and use of a rolling walker.  She was
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.  The
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge
plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to UPMCE from an outside hospital after
experiencing abdominal pain associated with bright red blood per
rectum.  An abdominal CT scan revealed free air within the
abdominal cavity due to perforation.  Therefore, you underwent
an emergent operation to repair a ruptured pelvic abscess.  You
have recovered from surgery in the hospital and have also worked
with occupational therapy, physical therapy and the ostomy care
RN and are now preparing for discharge to a rehab facility for
ongoing recovery.

Followup Instructions:
Please call for an Acute Care Service appointment at
test@mail.com.  You should schedule this appointment for 2013-11-27 00:00:00
days from discharge with Dr. Keaven Pecaut. At this appointment
you will possibly have your drain removed and your staples taken
out.

Please follow-up with Dr. Keaven Pecaut
2013-11-27 00:00:00 in the next 2 weeks. This would be regarding this
hospitalization if cardiology referral is needed for further
follow-up of the mitral regurgitation found on your Echo. You
should also discusss the possibility of a repeat Echo.
