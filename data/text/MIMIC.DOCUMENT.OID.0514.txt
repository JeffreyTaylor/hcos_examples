CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old gentleman
with a complicated past medical history including end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, chronic MRSA infection of an aorto-aortic graft,
aortic dissection status post repair in 2010-11-11 00:00:00, coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting, who
presented with a three-week history of increased confusion
and somnolence.

According to the patient's family, the patient had a slowly
declining mental status over the past three months; however,
during the three weeks prior to this admission, decline in
mental status was much more rapid.

One week prior to admission, the patient had increased
mumbling and has been speaking to people who were not
present.  On the night prior to admission, the patient's wife
reported that his head and eyes started twitching.  During
this time, the patient was intermittently communicative
versus nonsensical mumbling.

He had no history of bowel or bladder incontinence.  No
history of seizures or tongue biting.

On the day of admission, the twitching resolved following
hemodialysis; however, at hemodialysis, the patient continued
to be agitated and was sent to the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was
increased to 230/120.  At that time, he was given 100 mg IV
Labetalol and 1 in Nitropaste with a decrease in his blood
pressure to the systolic 170s.

On further review of systems, the patient's wife reported
that he was "hot" last night but denied any chills, cough,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bright red blood per
rectum, melena, chest pain or shortness of breath.

The patient had decreased p.o. intake one week prior to
admission.  The patient also complained of feeling heavy
times one week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  End-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday since 2010-11-11 00:00:00.  2.

Lentes 8 U q.h.s., Epogen 8000 U three times per week,
Seroquel 25 mg p.o. q.h.s., Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Vancomycin dosed at hemodialysis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired school principal
who lives with his wife.  Jezebell Stann is an immigrant from 123 Any St..  He
is former smoker.  No intravenous drug use.  The patient is
DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.7??????, blood
pressure 177/87, pulse 86, respirations 15, oxygen saturation
90% on room air.  General:  The patient was an elderly man
lying comfortably in bed, mumbling incoherently.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclera muddy.
Semi-dry mucous membranes.  Fundus not visualized.  Neck:
Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:
Soft.  Positive bowel sounds.  Nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Right femoral
groin line in place.  Right AV fistula thrill.  Neurological:
The patient was alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 6.8,
hematocrit 38.7, platelet count 239; INR 1.1; sodium 140,
potassium 4.8, chloride 97, bicarb 33, BUN 20, creatinine
5.7, glucose 126, iron 44, total iron binding capacity 240,
ferratin 792, hemoglobin A1C 7.7, CK 54.

CT of the head showed no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage, no shift of normally midline structures or mass
affect.  There was a stable appearance of low attenuation
area within the right frontal lobe.  There was chronic
bilateral microvascular infarctions in the periventricular
white matter.  There was a stable appearing bilateral lacunar
infarct.  There was moderate brain atrophy.

Chest x-ray showed stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Aorta
>...................  There was no pulmonary vascular
congestion, pleural effusion, local infiltrate or
pneumothorax.  There were degenerative changes in the left
shoulder.

Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 84 beats per
minute.  Left anterior descending.  Normal intervals.  T-wave
inversion in I, AVL, V5-V6, unchanged from 123 Any St.us studies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypertension:  The patient was admitted
with hypertensive urgency.  On admission he had no
electrocardiogram changes and a poorly visualized
.................. exam.

Initially the patient's blood pressure decreased with
Labetalol and an ACE inhibitor.  Initially the patient was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was
started on a Labetalol drip for blood pressure control.  At
that time, he was also continued on his home ACE inhibitor.

By 2010-11-11 00:00:00, the patient was able to be transferred
to the floor with oral control of his blood pressure.
Hypertension continued to be an active issue throughout the
hospitalization with the patient having frequent systolic
blood pressures in the 200s.

A final medication regimen of Labetalol 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d., Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d. has
provided the best blood pressure control in this patient.  In
addition, fluid is being removed in hemodialysis to decrease
the patient's dry weight in hopes of improving his
hypertension.  His blood pressure has been fairly well
controlled over the past 3-4 days with systolic blood
pressures most commonly in the 160-170s.

2.  Altered mental status:  In speaking with the patient's
family, he has had a declining mental status over the three
months prior to admission; however, this decline was
occurring more sharply in the three weeks prior to admission.
In addition, he had acute changes including mumbling and
hallucinations in the one week prior to admission.

During this admission, an extensive work-up was done to
evaluate the patient's mental status.  In addition to the CT
obtained on admission, the patient had an MRI of his head on
2010-11-11 00:00:00.  This revealed no evidence of abnormal
diffusion on diffusion weighted imaging to suggest a major or
minor vascular territorial infarct.

The exam was unchanged when compared to a 123 Any St.us exam from
2010-11-11 00:00:00, with diffuse abnormal signal in the
periventricular white matter and pons consistent with chronic
microvascular infarct, diffuse atrophy, and scattered tiny
foci of abnormal signal on ................. imaging
suggestive of remote hemorrhagic infarct and amyloid
angiopathy.

In addition, the patient had an EEG on 2010-11-11 00:00:00,
which showed slow rhythm throughout along with generalized
.................. delta slowing superimposed.  During this
study, the patient would talk "nonsense," and there were no
correlating EEG abnormalities to indicate seizure activity.
No focal or epileptiform features were seen.  The EEG was
considered most consistent with encephalopathy.

In addition, the patient had a negative toxicology screen,
normal TSH, normal Vitamin B12, and normal folic acid during
this admission.

Although there was a very low suspicion, a lumbar puncture
was attempted on 2010-11-11 00:00:00.  This was unsuccessful.

Throughout the admission, the patient's mental status
continued to wax and wane.  It is most likely multifactorial
due to his TIAs, CVAs, hypercalcemia, chronic infection, and
end-stage renal disease.  The patient's hyperkalemia is being
corrected at hemodialysis.  He is receiving Vancomycin for
his chronic aortic graft infection.

3.  End-stage renal disease:  The patient was continued on
his schedule of Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday hemodialysis
throughout the admission.  The patient was dosed with
Vancomycin at hemodialysis.  He was also continued on his
Nephrocaps 1 cap p.o. q.d. throughout the admission.

4.  Infectious disease:  The patient has a chronic infection
of his aortic graft with intermittent bacteremia.  His last
positive blood culture, which grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, was from 2010-11-11 00:00:00.
Throughout the admission, he continued to receive Vancomycin
at hemodialysis.

5.  Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was continued on Glargine
and sliding scale Insulin throughout the admission and q.i.d.
fingersticks.  Overall the patient had good blood sugar
control, although he did have multiple sugars in the low
200s.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was continued on Zantac
throughout the admission for symptoms of gastroesophageal
reflux disease.

7.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient
continued on the Americana Diabetic Association, 2 g sodium,
cardiac diet throughout the admission.

On 2010-11-11 00:00:00, the patient had an episode of choking
while taking his medications.  Following this episode, the
patient was made NPO.  His risk of aspiration due to his
waxing and Djay Larcade mental status was discussed with the family
at a family meeting on 2010-11-11 00:00:00.  They have decided
that he would wish to be fed despite the risk of aspiration.
They are in agreement with this.

On 2010-11-11 00:00:00, the patient had a swallowing study,
which he passed without difficulty while alert.  At this
time, the patient will be continued on a regular diet with
the family understanding the possible risk of aspiration.  He
should maintained on aspiration precautions.  The patient has
made 123 Any St.usly known his desire to not have a feeding tube.

8.  Prophylaxis:  The patient continued on subcue Heparin for
DVT prophylaxis throughout the admission.  He continued on a
bowel regimen.

9.  Code status:  The patient is DNR/DNI.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to
UPMCE Health Center for further care.
