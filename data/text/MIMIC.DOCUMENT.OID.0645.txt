The patient is transferred to the Cardiology Service on
2012-03-29 00:00:00.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old male with
an extensive medical history presented to the Emergency
Department on 2012-03-29 00:00:00 complaining of right lower quadrant
abdominal pain since 2 a.m.  Patient states that the pain was
nonradiating.  He also complained of dry heaves without any
emesis or diarrhea.  He did not report any fevers or chills.
He states that his fingersticks are within normal limits in
the 150s.  He does not report any weight gain or loss.  He
states that he has had similar episodes of right lower
quadrant pain which had been due to elevated lactate levels
and acidosis, and he had been treated conservatively in the
past.

CT scan of the abdomen which was done in the Emergency Room
on the date of admission showed dilated appendix concerning
for acute appendicitis.  Given the patient's extensive
medical history, specifically his cardiac risk factors, the
decision was made to conservatively treat the patient with
intravenous antibiotics.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation with DDI pacer.
2.  Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in
2012-03-29 00:00:00.
4.  Nephrolithiasis.
5.  History of colon cancer.
6.  Status post episode of bowel ischemia.
7.  End-stage cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 20 to 30%
with mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.6.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three in
2012-03-29 00:00:00.
2.  Sigmoid colectomy in 2012-03-29 00:00:00.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glyburide.
2.  Coumadin.
3.  Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Bumex.
9.  Carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON EVALUATION:  Temperature of 99.2,
heart rate 72, respiratory rate 24, blood pressure 133/55,
oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  He is ill appearing but
in no acute distress.  He is alert and oriented times three.
His sclerae are anicteric, and his neck is supple without any
masses.  His lungs have bibasilar crackles.  His heart is a
regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI holosystolic murmur.
His abdomen is nondistended and has normoactive bowel sounds.
The abdomen is soft and tender in the right lower quadrant
with guarding and rebound.  His extremities are arm and have
1+ edema bilaterally to the ankles.

LABORATORY DATA:  His CBC on evaluation was as follows:
White blood cell count 8.4, hematocrit 31.3 with 85
neutrophils and 7% lymphocytes.  His electrolytes were as
follows:  Sodium 134, potassium 5.4, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 58, creatinine 1.6, glucose 170.

His urinalysis had greater than 50 white blood cells with
moderate bacteria, moderate leukocyte esterases, and no
nitrites.

Cardiac enzymes were drawn upon initial evaluation.  The
first set showed a CK of 82 with a negative MB and troponin
of 0.05.

STUDIES:  KUB done in Emergency Room showed nonspecific bowel
gas pattern.

CT of the abdomen revealed a questionably dilated appendix
and free fluid in the pelvis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's extensive medical
history, specifically the patient's cardiac risk factors, the
patient was not taken to the Operating Room.  It was decided
to treat the patient conservatively with medical management.
He was placed on antibiotics which included Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  He was made NPO.  Intravenous fluids were started.
A Foley was placed to strictly measure his I's and O's.

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for the first
several days of his hospital course.  The patient was
continued on all of his cardiac medications.  His Coumadin
was held.  His CBC and electrolytes were closely followed
during the course of his hospital stay.  The patient's
symptoms significantly improved during the early part of his
hospital course.  His abdominal pain significantly subsided
with the antibiotics and bowel rest.  He remained afebrile,
and his vital signs were stable.

The CT scan was reviewed with several members of the
Radiology Department.  A closer look at the CT scan revealed
patient had a fluid collection that had been loculated and
was not the appendix, as had been earlier thought.  The
patient's white count remained within normal limits during
the course of his hospital stay.

Given that the patient's pain had significantly improved, his
diet was slowly advanced.  He was able to tolerate clear
liquids at the point of his transfer to the Cardiology
service.

The patient was having bowel movements, but he described them
as loose.  Clostridium difficile toxin studies were ordered
and were pending at the time this transfer.  Given that his
urinalysis upon initial admission had been positive for
urinary tract infection, sensitivities were drawn and the
organism was found to be sensitive to Macrodantin.  The
patient was placed on Macrodantin on hospital day four.

The Cardiology service followed the patient during the
initial part of his hospital course.  Given that they had
recommended that the patient's pacer be upgrade, it was
decided that, since he had been stable from a surgical
standpoint, he would be transferred to the Electrophysiology
service for management of his pacer.  Per the Cardiology
service's recommendations, the patient was given a dose of
vitamin K to reverse his INR in preparation for his pacer
procedure.  His INR responded to the vitamin K and was 1.9 on
the day of his transfer to the Cardiology service.  He was
transferred to their service on hospital day 5.

Remainder portion of this UPMCE hospital stay will be
dictated at a later date by the Cardiology team.
