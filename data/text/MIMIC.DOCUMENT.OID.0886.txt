surgery in two weeks at UPMCE, but the

patient has baseline dyspnea on exertion and the patient
presented with lightheadedness, but no loss of consciousness.
The patient denied chest pain and shortness of breath at

also denied fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, bright
red blood per rectum, melena or hematemesis.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a brother with a myocardial
infarction who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a cytologist. The patient had
a distant tobacco history, rarely drinks alcohol and lives
with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival, the patient's temperature
was 97.9, pulse 58, blood pressure 148/59, respiratory rate
18, 100 percent saturation on room air. The patient generally
is an elderly gentleman in no apparent distress. Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements
intact. The patient has no jugular venous distension. The
neck is supple without bruits. The patient's heart
examination was regular rate and rhythm with apical murmur
and systolic like ejection murmur. The patient's chest was
clear to auscultation bilaterally. The patient's abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds. The
patient's extremities had positive edema bilaterally.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented with a five
out of five strength throughout. The patient's skin had no
lesions or rashes.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 139, potassium 4.6,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 29, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, glucose
185. The patient's white blood cell count was 3.8, hematocrit
32.7, platelets 148. The patient's urinalysis was negative.
The patient had an echocardiogram in 2006-07-25 00:00:00 that showed an
ejection fraction of greater than 55 percent with mildly
dilated aortic root, mild aortic regurgitation and mild
mitral regurgitation. The patient had a cardiac
catheterization on 2006-07-25 00:00:00 which showed normal coronaries,
severe aortic stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, mild
pulmonary hypertension and a valvular area of 0.68 cm sq. The
patient's electrocardiogram showed normal axis, prolonged PR
without any drop beats and no ST changes from prior
electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
service under the care of Dr. Lennart Esposo. The Cardiothoracic
Surgery service was consulted for evaluation of aortic valve.
The patient was continued on his home regimen for diabetes
and blood pressure was well controlled. The patient was seen
by Cardiac Surgery and was evaluated to have repair of the
severe aortic stenosis. The patient underwent aortic valve
replacement with a 23 mm pericardial valve. The patient
tolerated the procedure without any difficulties and was sent
to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit. Please see the dictated
Operative Note for details.

On postoperative day one, the patient was extubated and was
also off inotropes. The patient remained in sinus rhythm with
good blood pressure. He was positive for approximately seven
liters since the operation. The patient's saturation was 93
percent on three liters. He was advanced to a cardiac diet.
He remained afebrile. BUN and creatinine were 15 and 0.6. He
received an insulin drip, which was weaned. The patient
continued to be on the vancomycin perioperatively. The
patient was started on metoprolol and Lasix. The patient was
seen by Dr. Lennart Esposo who felt that the patient had a slow sinus
rate and atrioventricular conduction. The patient was seen by
the EP service who felt that there was no current indication
for pacing with high output and felt that the
atrioventricular conduction was good and there was no need to
change the pacer.

On postoperative day two, the patient was transferred to the
floor. He remained afebrile with stable vital signs. The
patient's hematocrit was 28.2 and creatinine was 0.8. The
patient's wires were removed. The patient was continued on
Lasix. The Lopressor was increased to 25 mg b.i.d.

On postoperative day three, the patient complained of some
left shoulder pain. Otherwise, he was doing well. The patient
had a rate of 100 and pressure of 108/20 with saturation of
95 percent on two liters. The patient was continued on
intravenous Lasix and metoprolol. The patient was put on pain
medications for the left shoulder pain and glaucoma
medication.

On postoperative day four, the patient's heart rate was in
the 90s with good pressure, hematocrit of 24.7 and creatinine
of 0.7. The patient was transfused one unit of packed red
blood cells for the low hematocrit.

On postoperative day five, the patient had no events
overnight. The patient had a temperature of 100. Otherwise,
he had a good heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's
Lasix was changed to p.o. and he was continued on metoprolol.
The patient's hematocrit was 27.4 and potassium was 3.8,
which was repleted. Creatinine was 0.7. The patient was
cleared by Physical Therapy and was discharged home.

valve replacement, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, high homocystine
level, hyperthyroidism, appendectomy and hydrocele repair.
