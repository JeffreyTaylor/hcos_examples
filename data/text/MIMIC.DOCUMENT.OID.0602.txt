Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft times two, congestive heart
failure with ejection fraction of 35%, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation status post DDD pacer placement, admitted
2006-01-04 00:00:00 with sudden onset of right eye pain at home.  She
subsequently developed slurred speech and was taken to the
Emergency Department via EMS.  In the Emergency Department
the patient was noted to have slurred speech and a left
hemiparesis.  CAT scan was negative for hemorrhage, but
positive for a probable embolic right MCA stroke.  TPA was
administered in the Emergency Department without benefit.
The patient developed respiratory distress in the Emergency
Department requiring supplemental oxygen, Lasix and a trial
of a noninvasive ventilator.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU.  Blood
pressure was elevated on admission to 160 to 180.  Symptoms
of congestive heart failure were controlled with a
nitroglycerin drip initially.  Neurological examination
revealed complete left sided hemi123 Any St. with decreased
sensation of the left arm and a left facial droop.  The
patient has required no further diuresis in the MICU.  Blood
pressures were running in the 120s to 130s.  Nitroglycerin
drip was discontinued on 2006-01-04 00:00:00 upon arrival to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Speech and swallow evaluation on
2006-01-04 00:00:00 recommended nectar thick liquids since the patient
was considered to be at aspiration risk.  A repeat head CT on
2006-01-04 00:00:00 showed a large right MCA stroke unchanged from prior.
The patient's creatinine was slightly increased from
baseline, but her urine output was good.  An increased white
blood cell count was noted on 2006-01-04 00:00:00 considered to be stress
response versus evidence of infection and cultures were sent.

On 2006-01-04 00:00:00 and 2006-01-04 00:00:00 the patient was noted to have increased
alertness complaining of a headache with an unchanged
neurological examination.  On 2006-01-04 00:00:00 systolic blood pressure
was running 100 to 110 with the head of the bed at 30 degrees
elevation.  The patient was alert and interactive though not
opening her eyes.  She was subsequently transferred to the
floor.

oriented to hospital, state, but not year.  She is oriented
to the reason for her hospitalization and answers questions
appropriately.  HEENT she has dry oral mucosa.  The tongue is
midline.  She is unable to raise her eyelids.  The pupils are
poorly reactive bilaterally, but the patient does respond to
light stimuli.  There is poor response to threat bilaterally.
We were unable to assess visual fields and extraocular

distal lower extremities.

Neurological examination the patient's sensation is intact.
The patient is able to open her jaw against resistance and
shrug her shoulders.  She has a left sided visual field
defect/neglect.  Sensation, there is no response to light
touch to the left arm.  She does sense touch on the right
arm.  Light touch sensation is intact bilaterally in the
lower extremities.  Strength of the left arm is flaccid with
0 out of 5 strength.  The left leg is also flaccid.  The
right arm shows 5 out of 5 biceps and triceps.  The right leg

110, bicarbonate 32, BUN 39, creatinine 1.5, glucose 350,
calcium 8.0, phosphate 32.6, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.2.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Neurological:  The patient is admitted
with a large right MCA stroke of embolic origin.  The patient
was administered tissue plasminogen activator in the
Emergency Room without benefit.  The patient's residual
defects were a left facial droop, left hemiparesis and left
hemisensory deficits.  The patient's mental status seemed to
fluctuate at intervals during the course of the
hospitalization with intermittent periods of somnolence.
However, the patient was generally awake and easily oriented.
 There were no new focal neurological findings during this
admission and there was no reimaging of the head after
transfer to the floor on 2006-01-04 00:00:00.  The blood pressure goal on
transfer to the floor was 130s to 140s to maintain adequate
cerebral perfusion.  The patient remained intermittently
hypotensive and had to be bolused with fluids in order to
maintain a blood pressure in the low 100s.  Despite periods
of hypotension the patient's mental status remained largely
unchanged.  For the latter portion of the patient's admission
blood pressure remained stable in the 110s to 120s.  The
patient will follow up with the stroke service in several
weeks following discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Patient with a history of coronary
artery disease.  She was continued on aspirin during this
admission.  Captopril was added shortly after the UPMCE
transfer to the floor for treatment of congestive heart
failure.  The patient was known to be prone to flash
pulmonary edema as she had experienced in the Emergency
Department.  After her transfer to the floor she developed
increased respiratory distress over several days.  Pulmonary
examination and x-ray were consistent with moderate
congestive heart failure.  The patient was initially gently
diuresed with Lasix.  Following diuresis the patient became
transiently hypotensive to the 70s and 80s with mildly
depressed level of alertness and responsiveness.  At that
time the patient was bolused with 250 cc boluses of normal
saline to elevate the blood pressure to the low 100s.
Despite these boluses, the patient did not drop her O2
saturation.

As the patient's po intake improved over the course of the
admission.  She was ultimately taken off of maintenance
hydration and required no further fluid boluses to maintain a
blood pressure in the 110s to 120s.  She also maintained good
urine output and was considered to be essentially euvolemic
with a creatinine at or near baseline of 1.6 at the time of
discharge.  On 2006-01-04 00:00:00 during one period of relative
hypotension the patient was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation/flutter.  On further review of the patient's
vital signs and telemetry it was clear that the patient may
have been in flutter at least intermittently over the course
of two to three days.  It was felt that this might be
contributing to her difficulty breathing and to her
congestive heart failure.  She was initially loaded on
Amiodarone 400 mg po b.i.d. and this dose was continued up
until discharge.  On 2006-01-04 00:00:00 electrophysiology was consulted
for adjustment of the patient's pacemaker as she was
conducting her atrial rate at approximately 120 beats per
minute to the ventricle.  After adjustment of the pacemaker,
the patient was in continued atrial fibrillation/flutter, but
ventricularly paced at 60 beats per minute.  Cardioversion
was considered, but will be deferred.

We also discussed the possibility with anticoagulation with
the neurology service given the patient's atrial
fibrillation/flutter and risk for further embolic stroke.
Given the patient's recent stroke, this was held off.
However, after the patient was more then ten days out from
the stroke on the day of discharge 2006-01-04 00:00:00 the patient was
initiated on Coumadin anticoagulation at a low dose.  After
the patient achieves a goal INR of 2 to 3 the patient will be
considered for reattempt at cardioversion.  This will be done
after a therapeutic INR for three to four weeks by the
electrophysiology service.  Will attempt an interruption of
the flutter with overdrive atrial pacing.

3.  Pulmonary:  As noted the patient experienced mild
congestive heart failure early in this admission.  She was
effectively diuresed and became transiently hypotensive.  She
then responded to fluid boluses and continuous intravenous
fluids for several days.  During the latter several days of
the admission the patient was taken off intravenous fluids
and maintained good po intake to support her blood pressures.
 She was essentially euvolemic at the time of discharge.  The
patient also spiked a fever and while she did grow out
positive blood cultures or have positive sputum specimens,
chest x-ray was suggestive of a retrocardiac opacity perhaps
most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.  The patient
was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for a fourteen day course.
Although chest x-ray revealed a persistent left lower lobe
opacity at the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile
with no new respiratory complaints.  She should complete a
fourteen day course of Levaquin and Flagyl and should be
reimaged if she becomes febrile or new respiratory complaints
develop.

4.  Infectious disease:  As noted the patient was treated for
a possible aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and Flagyl.
The patient was also noted to have a urinary tract infection
positive for both proteus and enterococcus.  Both organisms
were sensitive to Levaquin.  Hematuria noted during the
initial presentation to the floor resolved over time and was
attributed to Foley trauma.

5.  Hematologic:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout this admission after initial drop in the MICU.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient's fluid
status was essentially euvolemic at the time of discharge.
She was requiring no supplemental intravenous fluids and was
maintaining good urine output.  She should be continued on
her prior dose of Lasix, however, should she become
hypovolemic, Lasix should be discontinued and the patient
should be further hydrated especially if her po intake should
taper off.  From an electrolyte standpoint the patient's
magnesium and potassium should be closely followed especially
given current Amiodarone use.  The patient should be
maintained on a diet of pureed foods and thickened liquids.
These should be administered to the right side of the mouth.
Thin liquids should be avoided for the most part.  The
patient should be sitting upright for her meals.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was maintained on Protonix
during this admission for ulcer prophylaxis.  She had
multiple repeated loose stools.  Stool cultures were negative
for clostridium difficile.

8.  Endocrine:  Patient with a history of hypothyroidism.
Her TSH was seemed to be elevated with a low T4 and her
Levoxyl dose was subsequently increased from 50 to 75 mcg po
q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Middle cerebrovascular artery stroke with left
hemiparesis.
2.  Atrial fibrillation/flutter.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Aspiration pneumonia.
5.  Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Coumadin 2.5 mg po q.d. as
starting dose with a goal INR of 2 to 3.  This dose can be
adjusted upward to attain this goal, but should be initiated
at the low current dose.  2.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.  3.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.d.  4.  Senokot one tab po
q.h.s. prn constipation.  5.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. prn
constipation.  6.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.  7.  Captopril 3.25
mg po b.i.d. held for systolic blood pressure less then 100.
8.  Flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d. until 2006-01-04 00:00:00.  9.  Levaquin 250 mg
po q.d. until 2006-01-04 00:00:00.  10.  Levoxyl 75 micrograms po q.d.  11.
Lasix 40 mg po q.d.  12.  Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d.  This
dose should be changed to 200 mg po t.i.d. on 2006-01-04 00:00:00.  It
should be then changed to 200 mg po b.i.d. on 2006-01-04 00:00:00.  200
mg b.i.d. will then remain as a maintenance dose.  13.
Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn pain.

INSTRUCTIONS:  1.  Diet:  The patient should be maintained on
pureed food and thickened liquids only diet.  Food should be
placed on the right side of the patient's mouth.  Thin
liquids should be avoided.  The patient should be seated
upright for all meals to avoid aspiration.  2.  The patient's
left hand and arm should be put through passive range of
motion and elevated periodically from an IV pole.  3.  INR
should be maintained at a goal of 2 to 3.  Coumadin is just
being initiated at the time of discharge at 2.5 mg q.d.  Low
dose Coumadin should be continued with potential further
adjustment to achieve goal INR of 2 to 3.  Follow up will be
scheduled with the electrophysiology cardiology team in
several weeks for evaluation of pacemaker and potential
override atrial pacing.  The patient will also be scheduled
for follow up with the neurological stroke team.  Please see
discharge page one for the dates of these follow up
appointments.  At her skilled nursing facility the patient
should receive a repeat swallow evaluation as well as
physical and occupational therapy.
