Pertinent Results:
DISCHARGE LABS:
-2009-02-09 00:00:00 02:55PM BLOOD Hct-24.0*
-2009-02-09 00:00:00 04:42AM BLOOD Glucose-110* UreaN-30* Creat-1.4* Na-140
K-4.6 Cl-109* HCO3-22 AnGap-14

IMAGING: CT ABD with contrast;
1. Slight decrease in size of rim-enhancing but mostly necrotic
pancreatic
tail neoplasm with fiducial seeds. No evidence of progression
here.

2. Interval development of significant bibasilar
peribronchovascular axial
interstitial and peripheral interstitial thickening in the
context of
enlarging pleural effusions and focal nodularity. These findings
in the lung bases are incompletely assessed but have
significantly changed from 2009-02-09 00:00:00 and all prior
examinations. While they could be infectious, more sinister lung
disease, specifically lymphangitis carcinomatosis is not
excluded.Correlation with symptoms recommended:If the patient
has infectious symptomology then these are probably not too
concerning but if there are no symptoms then a formal HRCT chest
should be performed to further evaluate.


Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo M with PMH of pancreatic CA, CAd s/p CABG, DM, who
presents with acute on chronic anemia, guaiac (+) in ED, hct of
18.8 in clinic, VSS. Transferred to ICU for acute GI bleed.
Refused EGD.  Received 2 units pRBC with rise of hct to 24.
Discharged in stable condition with plans for hct follow up as
outpatient.

# GIB: Sub-acute in nature given prior history. Baseline is high
30's. Was likely lower as NG lavage negative. He does have a
number of possible sources of bleeding both upper and lower -
diverticulosis, polyps, hemorrhoids, or bleeding from cyber
knife treatment. His last colonoscopy in 2009-02-09 00:00:00 shouwed internal
hemorrhoids and a polyp that was removed. He has been recent
hospitalized in 2009-02-09 00:00:00 for similar presentation.  Refused EGD.
Transfused 2 units pRBC with hct rise to 24.  Discharged in
stable condition with GI follow up and scheduled EDG.
Instructed to have follow up hct on 2009-02-09 00:00:00.

# Fatigue: Patient reported significant fatigue, very likely 2009-02-09 00:00:00

therapy x3. deemed a poor surgical candidate. CT scan today
showed no worsening.  Not actively managed while in-patient.
Has follow up with priamry oncolgist.

# CAD s/p coronary artery bypass: Held BP meds and ASA given
bleed.  Restarted on discharge.

# Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus: Covered with SSI and

Discharge Diagnosis:
chronic blood loss anemia requiring transfusion
pancreatic cancer s/p XRT
coronary artery disease s/p coronary bypass grafting
diabetes mellitus


Discharge Condition:
fair; hemodynamically stable, eating, walking


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for anemia from chronic bleeding into the GI
tract. Your hematocrit was 18 on arrival, and you were
transfused 2 units of blood. GI consult saw you, and discussed
performing an EGD (you did not have hematochezia, so colonoscopy
was not deemed necessary), but you declined to have the
procedure done during this admission. As this was not urgent,
due to the chronicity of the bleeding, we have scheduled this
for you as an outpatient.

Please follow up with all of your appointments.

Please have you blood level (Hematocrit) checked on 2009-02-09 00:00:00.
Have the results called in to Dr. Johni Hudd
