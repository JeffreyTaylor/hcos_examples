Brief Hospital Course:
#) Sepsis/RLE cellulitis: source appeared to be the cellulitis.
Surgery was consulted and felt that clincially, pt did not have
Nec Fasc or compartment syndrome. All Micro data from admission
negative. Initial CT scan or RLE (without contrast) showed:

Low-density region within the inferior aspect of the medial head
of the gastrocnemius muscle suggests pyomyositis, particularly
given the patient's clinical history. Several areas of low
density may reflect developing loculated fluid collections,
although at this time, no single loculated fluid collection is
identified that might be amenable to drainage.

Extensive and circumferential edema of the subcutaneous fat is
nonspecific, likely reflecting a combination of venous stasis
and cellulitis.

No specific evidence of osteomyelitis.

As there was evidence for ? fluid collection on initial CT scan,
a repeat CT scan the day before discharge showed diffuse
subcutaneous soft tissue edema. The differential diagnosis
includes changes related to cellulitis. However, there is no
evidence for phlegmon or abscess on this examination.

The patient was started in the ICU on broad spectrum abx
(Vanc/Unasyn-->Vanc/Zosyn) and the patient will complete a total
of 14 d of Vanc/Zosyn for treatment of the cellulitis.


#) DM2: Restarted metformin, 1000mg UPMCE and Actos, 45mg QD. As
patient had recent CT with IV contrast, will hold Metformin for
48 hours and pt to restart as outpt.
.
#) HTN: given recent Hypotension, ICU team started short acting
BB.  Pt's Blood pressure was stable on the floor; eventually
switched back to Atenolol 100 mg qhs with plans to reinstitute
Lisinopril 5 mg as outpt.
.
#) Anemia: Likely 2009-08-17 00:00:00 aggressive fluid re[** Location **]n in setting of
anemia, inflammation, and thalasemmia.  Pts HCT on admission was
36.4 which dropped to a nadir of 25.9 during the
hospitalization.  HCT on discharge was 27.5, pt was guiac (-).
