History of Present Illness:
Ms. Ozer is a 98yoF with severe diastolic HF NYHA class IV
with multiple exacerbations in past year, HTN, HLD, Afib, and
gait abnormality related to ?DM who presented from home on 2008-03-02 00:00:00
after sustaining a fall 3 day before. Her fall was unwitnessed,
but was thought to be mechanical, as pt tripped while getting
out of bed to the commode.  L hip pain developed over the next
few days, and her family brought her to the ED.  CT scans of the
cervical spine and head were negative for fracture or bleed. A
plain film of the hip showed chronic fractures of the left
superior and inferior pubic rami but no new fractures.  UA was
concerning for UTI, she was started on macrobid.  She was
subsequently transferred to the floor.
.
On transfer to the floor, her VS were 98.2 128/70 98 18 98/4L.
She was without acute complaints initially.  Her antibiotics
were broadened to linezolid and cipro on 2008-03-02 00:00:00.  On the evening
of 2008-03-02 00:00:00, she triggered on the floor for desaturation to 88% on
2-3L; came up to 94-95% with 5L O2.  At baseline, she is in the
low 90s on 2-3L at home.  She got lasix 60 IV x1 (takes
torsemide 100 UPMCE at home, but has been off since presentation
due to hypotension), mucomyst, morphine 0.5, and nebs. Repeat
lasix 40mg IV x1.  ABG 7.51/45/51/37. HR was noted to be in the
120-130s (home B-blockers also stopped secondary to
hypotension), got lopressor 5mg IV x 2 with little effect.
Attempted to put her on face mask for mouth breathing, but
patient kept ripping it off.  Pt was also complaining of chest
pain, and was felt to have altered mental status and increased
agitation.  Pt was trasferred to the MICU for further
management.

Of note, she is UPMCE speaking only; per her daughter, she has
not had any decreased interaction or confusion. The patient
lives in subsidized senior housing and has 24/7 care. The
daughter notes a slow decline in her functional status since a
2008-03-02 00:00:00 admission for MRSA pneumonia in which she was
temporarily intubated. She was recently admitted in 2008-03-02 00:00:00 for
CHF, and per the daughter, has not fully recovered functionally
since. She has had multiple 123 Any St.us falls in the past related
to neuropathy and already unsteady gait.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic diastolic heart failure, last EF 65% (2008-03-02 00:00:00)
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Atrial fibrillation (not anticoagulated due to fall risk)
- Microvascular disease

Social History:
Patient lives at home by herself at subsidized senior housing in
123 Any St. with assistance from family. She has a 24 hour care
worker that watches her 5 days a week. Her daughter watches her
the other 2 days each week. Her Grandson Juridia Ozer is an interpreter
at UPMCE and is very active in her care. Granddaughter is ?also
HCP. Aids help her with cleaning and shopping. No smoking or
drinking.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine Floor Course:
Ms. Ozer is a 98yo 98-speaking female with severe dCHF,
HTN, HLD, neuropathy, gait abnormalities who presents 3 days
after likely mechanical fall without evidence of significant
trauma.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  She developed hypoxia to the low 80s on
3LNC on HD3 with significant resipiratory distress and
tachypnea. CXR showed mild fluid overload.  She was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers and IV lasix with
rebounding of her sats to the upper 90s on 5LNC. She was
agitated and refused to wear an oxygen mask or complete her neb
treatments.  She calmed with IV morphine which likewise lessened
her tachypnea.  She again decompensated with respiratory
distress that evening and was subsequently transferred to the
ICU for further care. The etiology was felt likely combination
of pneumonia plus flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
elevated HR in DHF, also possible aspiration in the setting of
AMS. Pt was intubated and sedated. She was started on Meropenam
and Linezolid for a 10d abx coverage and underwent significant
diuresis with lasix gtt. She became afebrile, leukocytosis
resolved and resp secretions decreased. There were ongoing
discussions with palliative care regarding goals of care and
eventually family decided to extubate without reintubation. Soon
after, patient's oxygenation deteriorated on NC and face mask
and goals of care were shifted towards comfort measures only.
Non essential medications were discontinued and she was put on a
morphine drip. She passed away secondary to hypoxemic
respiratory failure on 2008-03-02 00:00:00 at 1:15AM with her daughter at her
bedside.
.
# S/P FALL:  She is a poor historian but states that she did not
lose consciousness or suffer any prodromal syncopal or
presyncopal symptoms.  She sustained no major trauma from her
fall aside from right eye echymoses, and CT of the head and
cervical spine revealed no fractures or bleeds.  She was
admitted for a syncope workup.  Her EKG and cardiac enzymes
ruled out MI.  She had no abnormalities on telemetry.  She was
mentating normally on admission.  She did not start new
medications recently.  She was not orthostatic.  Her daughter
relates a progressive functional decline over the last year
since being intubated in 2008-03-02 00:00:00 for MRSA pneumonia.  She
had fallen a number of times since.  Mechanical fall was
suspected given her history of lower-half parkinsonism, [** Location **]us
cerebellar strokes, severe arthritis, unstable gait, and
neuropathy.  Her family had [** Location **]usly decline rehab admission
and had chosen to keep her home with 24 hour care.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  she has been rate controlled with
diltiazem and metoprolol, which were continued on admission.
These were continued on admission but were intermittently held
due to hypotension. She is not on coumadin given her repeated
falls.  Her rates ranged from the 90s to low 100s, but climbed
to the 110s-120s at the time of her respiratory distress.
Metoprolol was continued during ICU stay at 12.5mg TID, dilt was
held.

# SEIZURE DISORDER:  She has been on phenytoin since her CVA
about 10 years ago which was accompanied by severe seizures.
Phenytoin was continued until goals of care shifted.

#) Altered mental status / agitation - differential includes
hypoxia, infection, MI, PE, antibiotic side effect, delirium.
Pt apparently had normal MS when she presented.  MS appears to
be altered in the setting of hypoxia and respiratory distress.
Infection is also a possibility with known UTI and question of
PNA in the setting of worsened respiratory status.  MI was
considered as possibility as pt complained of chest pain,
although she has had negative CE x 2 since admission.  Pt was
started on cipro for UTI, which is known to cause AMS in elderly
patients. Pt was subsequently intubated and therefore it was
difficult to assess her status, however she alternated between
more agitated and more lethargic. She was started on seroquel
25mg UPMCE with some improvement of agitation. As goals of care
shifted, she was put on a morphine drip and agitation resolved.

#) Hypernatremia: Pt developed hypernatremia to 150 in setting
of lasix gtt with inability to take PO. Pt was started on free
water flushes with TF with resolution of hypernatremia.

#) Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive in setting of intubation
and sedation. She was started on neo for pressure support given
tachycardia from a.fib. This was then transitioned to levophed
to improve peripheral perfusion. With decreasing sedation and
decreasing diuresis patient was able to be weaned off pressure
support.
