Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was enrolled in sepsis protocol and arrived on the
intensive care unit intubated and sedated.  Continued to be
febrile despite broad spectrum antibiotic therapy.  CT chest
revealed moderate right pleural effusion with collapse of both
RML and RLL and likely loculation.  Thoracentesis was performed
which revealed parapneumonic effusion.  Initially, chest tube
was placed, but returned minimal fibrinous drainage due to
loculation of effusion.  Video assisted thoracoscopy was
required for lysis of adhesions and placement of two chest tubes
for drainage.

Of note, throughout unit course, patient was thought to have
significant pain given elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and
discordant breathing with ventilator. Chronic pain service was
consulted given patient's baseline chronic pain and heavy
narcotic dependence (#30 percocet/day).  Patient was weaned to
30mg oxycodone per hour with morphine sulfate for breakthrough
pain.

Patient did well following drainage of the parapneumonic
effusion and was extubated and chest tubes removed.  Blood
cultures drawn from internal jugular central line grew 2011-08-30 00:00:00
bottles of gram positive cocci, and subsequently, all indwelling
lines were removed.  Patient remained in the intensive care unit
for 2 additional days, then was deemed stable for transfer to
the floor.
