Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female
patient who had a very prolonged 123 Any St.us hospitalization at
the UPMCE and was ultimately
discharged on 2012-06-22 00:00:00.  During her hospitalization,
she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic
valve replacement.  Her postoperative course was complicated
by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well
as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed
by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal
failure.  Please see discharge summary from that
hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after
her cardiac surgery.

The patient was readmitted to the hospital on 2012-06-22 00:00:00
due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite
being on intravenous antibiotics.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of
purulent drainage in the open sternal wound.  The patient was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft as 123 Any St.usly noted with an aortic valve replacement
for aortic stenosis.
2. End-stage renal disease.  The patient is hemodialysis
dependent.
3. Hypertension.
4. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
5. Sleep apnea.
6. Vertigo.
7. Osteoarthritis.
8. Skin cancer in the past.
9. Abdominal hernia repair.
10. Uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
11. Obesity.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:
1. Tobramycin.
2. Vancomycin.
3. Reglan.
4. Protonix.
5. Amiodarone.
6. Zoloft.
7. Compazine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  The
patient was awake and responsive, following commands
appropriately.  She was on a ventilator via tracheostomy.
HEENT was unremarkable.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Patient was tachycardic with a regular, rate,
and rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, and
nondistended.

LABORATORY VALUES UPON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  White
blood cell count of 10,000, hematocrit of 32, platelet count
of 201.  Sodium of 148, potassium 3.3, chloride 110, CO2 21,
BUN 42, creatinine 3.7, glucose of 277.

Patient initially had an echocardiogram which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60% and moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

Chest x-ray on admission to the hospital revealed a small
left pleural effusion, and questionable congestive heart
failure pattern.

It was noted that the patient's Vancomycin and tobramycin
levels were quite low upon admission to the hospital, and she
was restarted on both of those medications.

On 2012-06-22 00:00:00, hospital day two, the patient underwent a
Plastic Surgery consultation due to persistent sternal wound
infection, which had 123 Any St.usly been healing now showing
signs of infection.  Patient was also noted to have
Clostridium difficile colitis, for which she had been placed
on intravenous Flagyl.

The patient was ultimately taken to the operating room on
2012-06-22 00:00:00 after transesophageal echocardiogram the
123 Any St.us day ruled out endocarditis.  In the operating room
the patient underwent a limited sternal wound debridement and
drainage of some fluids at the inferior portion of her wound.

Postoperatively, the patient returned to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit, where she has had problems with
intermittent hypotension requiring IV Neo-Synephrine drip.
Patient continued on tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube
which was 123 Any St.usly placed during her 123 Any St.us admission,
which she had been tolerating well.  She was still on the
ventilator on varying levels of pressure support in the CPAP
mode which she had tolerated well on 50% FIO2.

Patient received a few units of packed red blood cells over
the course of the next few days due to drifting hematocrit.
Patient's sternal wound had remained clean, and ultimately a
VAC dressing was placed in the sternal wound area on 2012-06-22 00:00:00.  The patient was maintained on 3x a week hemodialysis
treatments on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and has been
tolerating those treatments well.  Patient's pressure support
was ultimately weaned from 12 to 5, and she has remained on
pressure support of 5 for the past few days with an FIO2 of
50% and a PEEP of 5 as well, and has remained stable on those
ventilator settings.

The patient has had short bouts of trache mask trials, but
does get tachypneic after approximately 30 minutes.  Patient
also required bedside repositioning of her jejunostomy tube
which was done in the Intensive Care Unit successful with no
sequelae from that patient.  The patient has remained with
stable hemodynamic parameters.  Has been tolerating her tube
feeds, has remained on minimal ventilator supports, and she
is ready to be transferred to rehabilitation facility to
progress with Physical Therapy, rehabilitation, and ultimate
weaning from a ventilator.

The patient's condition day on 2012-06-22 00:00:00 is as follows:
temperature is 99.0, heart rate is 88 in normal sinus rhythm,
respiratory rate varies from 18-24.  Her blood pressure is
114/46.  On the ventilator, the patient is in a CPAP mode
with 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support, and 50% of O2 with a
most recent blood gas being 7.41, 41, 73, 27.  Other
laboratory values from today, 2012-06-22 00:00:00 are as follows:  White
blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit of 35.8, platelet count of
206.  PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 29.9, sodium 132, potassium 5.3,
chloride 99, CO2 24, BUN 64, creatinine 3.6, glucose 124.

Patient's most recent chest x-ray was on 2012-06-22 00:00:00 which
showed a chronic left pleural effusion.

Most recent cultures include a sputum culture from 2012-06-22 00:00:00
which revealed MRSA, Pseudomonas, as well as Serratia.
Patient is 123 Any St.usly cultured MRSA from both her leg wound
and her sternal wound.  Stool on 2012-06-22 00:00:00 is positive for
Clostridium difficile.  Urine on 2012-06-22 00:00:00 is positive for
proteus and enterococcus, and her sternal wound swab on 2012-06-22 00:00:00 had rare growth of diphtheroids.

Physical examination today:  The patient is awake, alert, and
responsive.  She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Her
chest wound is clean with a VAC dressing in place.  Her
abdomen is soft, obese, and nontender.  Her extremities are
with 2+ edema bilaterally.
