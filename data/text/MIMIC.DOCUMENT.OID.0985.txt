HPI: Pt is a 79yo male h/o of aortic stenosis (asymptomatic) and
recently discovered adenocarcinoma of the colon (by colonoscopy
in 2013-03-15 00:00:00) presenting for aortic valvuloplasty and pre-op L heart
cath for resection of adenoCA of mid-ascending colon on Tuesday
AM by Dr.Kalman Tasch service.
.
OMR note from 2013-03-15 00:00:00 states pt was doing well with no sx of CHF.
An echocardiogram on 2013-03-15 00:00:00 showed progression of aortic
stenosis with aortic valve area falling from 0.9 to 0.6
centimeters squared between
last year and this year.  The LVEF had decreased from 50% to
35-40%.  There was severe hypokinesis at the anterior septum.
There was mild to moderate MR.  Compared with 2013-03-15 00:00:00, LV
systolic function was diminished and aortic stenosis thought to
have progressed.
.
R heart cath and L heart cath was performed in addition to the
valvuloplasty. C.O. 4.25 baseline, 4.15 s/p intervention; CI
2.14, 2.12 s/p intervention. Hemodynamics showed baseline mean
aortic valve gradient ~35mm Hg with calculated 123 Any St. 0.69cm2.
Mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures.  LV gram was not
performed.  L heart cath revealed left dominant system:
LMCA: dual ostia of LAD and LCx from aorta
LAD: 50% ostial, otherwise normal
LCX: normal
RCA: normal.
After interventon (balloon valvuloplasty, mean aortic valve
gradient reduced to 30mmHg wtih calculated 123 Any St. of 0.8cm2.

Studies:

Cardiac cath 2013-03-15 00:00:00
COMMENTS:
  1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
patient
revealed mild single vessel disease.  The LMCA was absent as
there were dual ostia for the LAD and LCX.  The LAD had a 50%
ostial lesion but was otherwise angiographically normal
including branch vessels.  The LCX and dominant RCA were
angiographically normal.
  2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling
pressures with very mild elevation of left sided filling
pressure with PCWP and LVEDP of about 15mmHG.  The cardiac index
was slightly low at 2.17. There was no step up in oxygen
saturations from SVC to PA.
3.  Baseline trans aortic gradient was measured at mean of
35mmHG
corresponding with 123 Any St. of .69cm2.
4.  After valvuloplasty the mean gradient fell to 30mmHG with
123 Any St. of
.8cm2.
5. Aortic valvuloplasty was performed using a 20 x 60 mm balloon
and a 22 x 50 mm balloon.  Following balloon valvuloplasty, the
aortic valve gradient decreased to 30 mmHg with a calculated
valve area of 0.8 cm2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild single vessel CAD in LAD
2. Critical Aortic stenosis at baseline which improved slightly
after
valvuloplasty
3. Low cardiac index with slightly elevated left sided filling
pressures.
4. Successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on 2013-03-15 00:00:00 for a pre-operative aortic
balloon valvuloplasty (please see cardiology note for details).
On 2013-03-15 00:00:00 the patient underwent a laproscopic right colectomy by
Dr. Damase Paso (please see operative note for details).  The
operation went well with no complications.  On POD 0, the
patient spiked a temperature of 102.4, which was determined to
be from atelectasis as his wounds looked and chest X-ray looked
good.  Blood and urine cultures were subsequently negative.
Vancomycin, gentamycin and flagyl were started empirically
because of his recent valvuloplasty.  On POD 1, he required 1.5
liters in fluid boluses for hypotension (SBP in the 70's to
80's).  He seemed to respond and his urine output was
outstanding at over 100 cc/ hour.  However, that night he
developed tachycardia  to the 130's-140's and hypotension to
80/55.  He was assymptomatic, however an EKG showed A-flutter vs
A-fibrillation.  He was subsequently transferred to the surgical
ICU.  The cardiology service was consulted and responded
immediately and cardioverted the patient.  Afterwards he was
hemodynamically stable.  Amiodarone was started at 200 mg PO
TID.  Consideration was given to heparinize the patient, however
cardiology did not feel the need to do so given that he
responded well to the amiodarone and cardioversion and did not
experience any more atrial fibrillation.  Gentamycin was
discontinued.  On POD 2, he continued to require fluid boluses
to keep his SBP above 90.  On POD 3, he was started on clears.
He did not require any more fluid boluses.  Antibiotics were
discontinued as he was afebrile with a normal WBC.  On POD 4, he
was started on a regular diet which he tolerated well.  His IV
was heparin locked.  His central line was discontinued.
Physical therapy saw and evaluated the patient and determined
that he was fit to go to his daughter's house with services and
not to rehabillitation.  On POD 6, he continued to do well and
was discharged home on an amiodarone taper.
