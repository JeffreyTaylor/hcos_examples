Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Xanax / Vicodin / darvocet

Attending:Birda Orna
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical intubation and ventilation.


History of Present Illness:
87 yof with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin with
recent total shoulder arthroplasty secondary to OA, who presents
in respiratory failure. History is obtained from the son who
reports that he was with her until 8pm tonight at which point
she felt well without complaint. Around 11pm, he received a call
from her complaining of SOB. He notes that she has had a
non-productive cough for the past few days but no shortness of
breath until tonight. She was not complaining of chest pain or
any other symptoms. He arrived at her house and reports hearing
a gugurling sound while she breathed. EMS was called, and pt's
respiratory distress progressed requiring intubation in the
field.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, CXR was obtained consistent with
pulmonary edema. EKG was vpaced and unable to be interpreted for
ischemia. She was sedated with fent/versed/propofol and vent
setting on transfer to the MICU were AC TV: 450 P: 18 peep 13
100% fiO2. Her tox screen positive for benzos and tylenol. INR
was elevated at 5.2. Hct was 33.6 down from 36.8 on 2013-02-28 00:00:00. Pt
triggered for hypotension and propfol drip was held and she
received 2L of NS. This was followed by a dose of 40mg IV lasix

.
On arrival to the MICU, VS were: T 97.8 BP 175/75 HR 65 O2 100%
on the above settings.
.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain as she is intubated.

III) Imaging:

STUDY: PA and lateral chest, 2013-02-28 00:00:00.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 87-year-old woman recently admitted for CHF
exacerbation,
now with cough.

FINDINGS: The pacemaker is unchanged. There is again seen a
hardware within
the upper lumbar spine as well as a right reverse total shoulder
arthroplasty.
There has been removal of the feeding tube and the endotracheal
tube. The
heart size is upper limits of normal. There is some mild
tortuosity and
calcifications of the thoracic aorta. There is no pulmonary
edema, pleural
effusions, or focal consolidation.

Chest xray 2013-02-28 00:00:00
FINDINGS: A single portable supine chest radiograph was
obtained.
Interstitial and alveolar opacities, and hilar indistinctness
are new since
2013-02-28 00:00:00. Pacemaker leads project over the expected location of
the right
atrium and right ventricle. Endotracheal tube ends in the mid
trachea. The
aortic arch is calcified. Lower lumbar pedicle screws are
intact. Right
humeral hardware is partially visualized.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema is new since 2013-02-28 00:00:00.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

IV) Studies:

TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac
output. Mild to moderate (2013-02-28 00:00:00+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (2013-02-28 00:00:00+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2013-02-28 00:00:00,
the estimated pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. The other
findings are similar.

VI) Studies pending at discharge: None

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, mobitz type 2 heart block s/p pacemaker (DDD), and
chronic diastolic heart failure admitted with acute respiratory
failure due to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure

Active Issues:
#Respiratory failure secondary to decompensated dialstolic
congestive heart failure.
#Atrial fibrillation with supratherputic INR

#Acute Respiratory failure/Acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure:
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU after being intubated
in the field. The patient was diuresed with improvement in
oxygenation and was able to be extubated in ~24 hours. TTE in
the ICU was notable for preserved EF with slight increase in
MR/AI, but was otherwise stable from prior without new wall
motion abnormalities. Cardiac biomarkers were negative and CXR
did not show any focal opacities suggestive of
pneumonia/pneumonitis. Patient was seen by EP for pacer
interrogation and no arrythmias including no recent atrial
fibrillation in the preceeding week was found. Supratherapeutic
INR made PE unlikely as well. The patient and her family members
also mentioned that the patient had been in strict compliance
with her outpatient medications. Patient did complain of URI
type symptoms however. Therefore, it was felt that the patient's
acute CHF decompensation was likely related to increased demand
from her infection in the setting of baseline diastolic
dysfunction, although the exact cause is not completely clear.
She was felt to be euvolemic on transfer from the ICU to the
medical floor and did well for >24 hours on her home medication
regimen prior to discharge. She was evaluated by physical
therapy who felt the patient was safe to go home with a walker
and home PT. Upon discharge, the patient's lungs were clear
(both by auscultation and radiographically) and  she was able to
maintain oxygen saturation of 100% RA while working with PT.

# Atrial fibrillation with supratheraputic INR:
Patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with type II AV block
s/p PPM. Her heart rate and rythym are well controlled on
amiodarone, atenolol, and verapmil.  Upon admission her INR was
5.2. Her coumadin was held until 2013-02-28 00:00:00. On 2013-02-28 00:00:00, she
received one mg of coumadin. The following day she was restarted
on her home dose of coumadin (3.5mg). She has home VNA for a
scheduled blood draw on monday 2013-02-28 00:00:00 which will be
reported into her PCP.
.

Chronic issue:
# Anemia: In the setting of her supratherputic INR, there was a
concern that her hematocrit drop might be secondary to an occult
GI bleed. The patient remained guaic negative and her hematocrit
remained stable. LIkely represented an anemia of chronic disease
rather than acute bleed.

# Mobitz Type 2 AV block: Her pacemaker was interrogated by EP.
The pacemaker was and has been functioning properly with
scattered episodes of atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation not
temporally coinciding with the patients acute decompensation.

.
Medication Changes: None.

# Transitional Issues:
1. The patient was maintained on her normal home dose of 40mg PO
qd lasix for 24 hours prior to discharge. Upon follow up, one
might consider adjusting the patient's outpatient regimen of
lasix as warranted by her voume status.
2. The patient has home tele-monitoring CHF service as well as
home VNA and PT.
3. The patient's TSH was checked. Her T4/T3 were within normal
limits which is consistent with her thyroid function according
to past medical records.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Poulin,

You were admitted for respiratory failure in the setting of
acute congestive heart failure. We have removed the extra fluid
from your lungs and your breathing has signficantly improved.
The other good news is that you did not have a heart attack. We
know this because your cardiac enzymes which are a very
sensitive marker for heart attack were negative.

In terms of preventing future episodes of heart failure, it is
very important that you stay strictly compliant with your
medications. In addition, you should be eating a diet which is
low in sodium. Please limit your sodium intake to less than
2grams per day.

You need to be weighed every day. If your weight has increased
by more than 3 pounds you should call your primary care doctor
for further advice (PCP: Amoi Poulin,Amoi Poulin Amoi Poulin. test@mail.com.)

Your TSH levels, (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels are low.
In the past you have also had low levels of TSH. We suggest that
talk to your PCP Poulin 2013-02-28 00:00:00 about your thyroid levels.

Please resume all of your normal home medications at the doses
prescribed prior to admission.

You will need to have your INR checked on Monday and the results
sent to your PCP. Amoi Poulin will help you arrange this.

If you experience any of the danger signs listed below please
call your primary care physician or go to the nearest emergency
department.
