Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Chen Leahan
Chief Complaint:
123 Any St. Syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
5-days IVIG therapy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60-year-old left-handed woman with a history of
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from
which she recovered fully about 20 years ago who presents from
an outside hospital today with 2 days of
paresthesias and one day of weakness for evaluation of possible
123 Any St. Syndrome.  The patient reports that on 2008-12-06 00:00:00 she
underwent a t-lith procedure and initially had made an excellent
recovery.  However, 2 days prior to presentation she noted that
she had tingling of the hands and feet with an abnormal
decreased sensation over the remainder of her upper and lower
extremities as though it were "covered with chiffon."  The
patient had been
walking with a cane after surgery prior to today, when she noted
that her legs began to buckle, and she required a walker to
stand and walk.  There were no preceding illnesses including
cough, cold, vomiting, diarrhea or fever.  She has had no recent
vaccinations.  She has noted no difficulty coughing or swalling,
no changes in vision or diplopia, and no worsening over the
course of the day.  The patient feels that this presentation is
quite different than her CIPD, in particular in the rapidity of
onset as the CIPD presented over several weeks while this
illness has become fulminant over 2 days.
ROS:
The pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia. Denied difficulties producing
or comprehending speech. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. The patient denied recent fever or chills. No night
sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias. Denied rash.

Thoracic spine MRI:
Unremarkable MRI of the thoracic spine. There is no definite
abnormal
enhancement of the nerve roots, although evaluation is somewhat
suboptimal on
the axial images given motion artifact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Initially the patient was admitted to the neurology ICU team,
however, given that her NIF and vital capacity were excellent at
-55 and 2.2 L respectively, she was transferred to the floor the
same day.  A lumbar puncture was not obtained as her
history/exam were highly consistent with 123 Any St. Syndrome
and she had recently undergone spinal surgery.  She started IVIG
on 2008-12-06 00:00:00, com123 Any St.g a 5-day course on 2008-12-06 00:00:00.  Initially, she
had an overall positive response to IVIG though her exam
fluctuated throughout the course.  Her NIFs and vital capacities
remained quite stable without any need for respiratory
supportive measures.  On 2008-12-06 00:00:00 she began complaining of
band-like tightening around her lower chest.  Based upon concern
for a possible spinal process she underwent a thoracic spine MRI
with contrast which was unrevealing.  She had 123 Any St.usly
undergone a c-spine MRI at the outside hospital thus this was
not repeated.  She received physical and occupational therapy
during her stay. Lumbar puncture performed on 2008-12-06 00:00:00 via IR
was significant for a protein level of 553 and glucose of 56.
.
Becuase her neurologic exam demonstrated persistant weakness, it
was determined that she should have an additional course of
IVIG. After 2 days of this course of IVIG,
developed worsening autonomic instability as well as possibly a
hemolytic anemia as a complication of the IVIG.  It was
concluded that the IVIG should be discontinued and
plasmapharesis was chosen for treatment.  Due to concerns for
increasing weakness, autonomic dusyfunction, and potential
repiratory distress, the patient was transiently transferred
back to the ICU.  A pharesis catheter was placed, and the
patient received two of the five planned plasmapheresis
treatments.  She experienced an increase in upper extremity
strength, improved ease of breathing, and a decrease in
dysphagia.  Blood pressure monitoring revealed less labile
values over the course of three days.  The patient's respiratory
status was closely monitored with NIFs and vital capacity.  The
periodic studies demonstrated stability.  Accordingly, she was
transferred to the step-down unit.
.
Back in the neurology step-down unit, she continued to have
episodes of dysautonomia and hypotension in to the systolics in
the 70s which respond to fluid boluses and Trendelenburg
positioning.  As her hematoricrit continued to drop
progressively, she was transfused 2 units of PRBCs once her
hematocrit reached 18.7.  Hematology consult concluded that this
was a hemolytic process secondary to IVIG treatment.  Her
hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest of her stay with
a hematocrit of 30 on day of transfer. She completed the 5
treatment course of plasmapharesis.  Following these treatments,
her neurologic exam showed improved strength in all
extremtities.
.
On 2008-12-06 00:00:00, urinalysis was performed which 2008-12-06 00:00:00 WBC and many
bacteria.  Therefore, ciprofloxacin was started.  At time of
transfer, urine culture results are unavailable; UPMCE will be
in contact to provide final urine culture results so that she
can be on an antibiotic that is sensitive.
