Attending:Jyshawn Podlesny
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation
Pericardiocentesis
S/p pericardial drain placement.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Sumida is a pleasant 54 yo gentleman with h/o longstanding
atrial fibrillation and single kidney who presents to the CCU
after becoming hypotensive during pulmonary vein isolation
procedure.
.
Mr. Sumida atrial fibrillation had been well-controlled on
flecainide until recently, when he began experiencing episodes
of symptomatic tachycardia despite taking his medication
faithfully.  During his pulmonary vein isolation procedure
today, his blood pressure dropped to 68/55.  He was given IV
fluids with increase in BP to 94/71, and his heparin gtt was
reversed with protamine 25mg.  Stat echocardiogram revealed
pericardial effusion, and patient underwent urgent
pericardiocentesis with removal of 400cc of serous fluid from
the pericardial space.  BP at end of procedure was 111/64, and
he was transferred to the ICU intubated and with his pericardial
drain in place.  He continued to have good urine output
throughout the event.
.
Shortly after his transfer to the ICU, he was successfully
extubated.  He reports some discomfort in his chest where the
drain is in place, worse with taking a deep breath.  He is
otherwise comfortable.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
Atrial fibrillation not on coumadin
Borderline HTN
Solitary left kidney due to surgical complication as a child
Atonic bladder--performs self-cath QID; on cefuroxime for PPx
h/o bladder surgery in 2008-08-09 00:00:00
s/p TURP 2008-08-09 00:00:00
s/p inguinal hernia repair

Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse; he drinks 2-3 glasses
of wine weekly.  He lives with his wife and 2 children and works
as a writer.

or sudden death.  Mother had Elisaul Sumida sinus syndrome; father had
Elisaul Sumida.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
with normal free wall contractility. There is no pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
2008-08-09 00:00:00, there is no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 54 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation who
presented for a pulmonary vein isolation procedure, became
hypotensive during the procedure and was noted to have a
pericardial effusion, prompting pericardial tap & placement of a
pigtail catheter for drainage of the effusion.  Pt was
transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and was
normotensive on arrival.
.
Pericardial Effusion: Etiology of the effussion is unclear,
possibly related to a recent viral illness/pericarditis.  The
initial drainage was sent for cytology, which demonstrated no
malignant cells.  Effusion was serous and found to have a low
HCT of 1.3, suggesting this was not due to perforation.
Overnight, in the ICU, patient produced approximately 250cc
serosanguinous drainage.  TTE the morning after admission showed
no pericardial effusion.  Once resolution of pericardial
effusion was verified, pigtail catheter was removed for
discharge.  Pt was hemodynamically stable and was felt to be
stable for discharge.  Pt was scheduled for follow up ECHO 2
days following discharge and cardiology follow up with Dr.
Sumida.
.
Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in sinus rhythm after the
pulmonary vein isolation procedure and there were no episodes of
Afib noted on telemetry. Flecainide dosage was increased to
100mg UPMCE and pt was continued on Aspirin 325mg and Verapamil
80mg UPMCE per outpt regimen.
.
Hypotension: Hypotension was likely multifactorial, including
anesthesia, vagal nerve stimulation & pericardial effusion.  Pt
was not tachycardic & did not require pressors.  Blood pressure
normalized after pericardial tap & pt remained normo to
hypertensive through the rest of his hospital course.  Verapamil
was initially held because of hypotension during the pulmonary
vein isolation, but as his blood pressure remained stable on the
floor, verapamil 80mg UPMCE was restarted on discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You presented to UPMCE for elective pulmonary vein isolation to
treat your atrial fibrillation.  The procedure was complicated
by a drop in your blood pressure, for which you were treated.
An echocardiogram done at the time showed fluid around your
heart, which was drained.  You were admitted to the CCU for
observation and further draining.  The fluid has been sent off
for further evaluation, and you are stable for discharge with
appropriate follow-up.

The following medication was changed:
Flecainide was increased to 100 mg 2x/day for atrial
fibrillation.
Please take all other home medications as prescribed.

If you experience any chest pain, chest pressure with jaw or arm
pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, or any other
concerning symptoms, please call 911 or come to the ED.

Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care
physician in the next 1-2 weeks.

The following appointments have already been scheduled:
- Echocardiogram: on 2008-08-09 00:00:00 at 9am. UPMCE 3 (UPMCE).
Please call test@mail.com with questions.
- Cardiology: Dr. Jyshawn Podlesny on 2008-08-09 00:00:00 at 1pm.  Please call
