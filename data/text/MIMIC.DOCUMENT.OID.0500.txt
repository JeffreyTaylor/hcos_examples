Service:  ORT                     Date:  2008-11-10 00:00:00

Date of Birth: 1950-12-09 00:00:00 00:00:00        Sex:  F

Surgeon:  Chynia Lafon, 17977

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left proximal humerus fracture.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Left proximal humerus fracture.

PROCEDURE:  Left proximal humerus hemiarthroplasty.

INDICATIONS:  Mrs. Chynia Lafon is a 69-year-old female patient
with a complex medical history including end-stage renal
disease on dialysis, diabetes. She fell approximately 4 to 6
weeks ago, sustaining a two-part proximal humerus fracture
that has not healed. Over the last 2 weeks of her medical
admission to manage respiratory issues, it was noted that the
flow from her arterial venous fistula which is on the injured
side of her extremity was deficient.  An angiogram was
obtained which demonstrated the presence of the humerus
fracture. It is unclear when this fracture occurred,
presumably it could have occurred during transportation given
that the patient has no history of falling. The fracture was
significantly displaced, and
significantly angulated. The patient received alternative
hemodialysis access and the left upper extremity fistula was
left at this point unused in preparation for possible surgery
to address the humerus fracture. the patient has so far not
 develop any healing
or callus on films. I think this is not unusual given her
medical
history and
believe a repair of this 2-part humerus fracture would
probably result in a non UPMCE and I therefore believe that the
approach to address her fracture instability surgically is to
perform a hemiarthroplasty. The family agrees and she now
presents for procedure.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and after the successful induction of general
anesthesia was placed in the beach-chair position. The left
upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
manner. Via the deltopectoral approach, the fracture was
exposed. There was significant soft tissue  scarring but no
callous and there was good lateral
perfusion on the soft tissues which bleed considerably. This
is secondary to the presence of the fistula nearby.
Hemostasis was achieved with Lafon electrocautery. The
deltopectoral interval was found and the fracture was
exposed. The humeral head, lesser tuberosity and greater
tuberosity were osteotomized and preserved and the remaining
head was removed. The canal was exposed and reamed and
broached to accept a 12 mm Osteonics humeral prosthesis. A 21
mm humeral head was then selected and was found to give
appropriate fit and range of motion. At this point, the canal
was irrigated. The final components were then brought to the
field and cemented with one bag of PMMA cement. The final
components were assembled and the lesser tuberosity and
greater tuberosity were repaired over the prosthesis using
the threaded holes in the prosthesis.  The wound was
copiously irrigated and closed in layers with 0 PDS and 2-0
nylon over a drain. Dr. Lafon was present for the entire
procedure. All counts of sponges and instruments were
correct. C arm imaging was used at the end of the procedure to
establish the appropriate height and anatomy was restored.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to
recovery room without incident. Dr. Lafon was present for
the entire procedure.

CT head (2008-11-10 00:00:00):

FINDINGS: There is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns
and sulci are somewhat prominent, likely due to atrophic
changes. Again identified are scattered hypodensities within the
subcortical white matter consistent with small vessel ischemic
disease. A small area of decreased attenuation is identified
within the right basal ganglia consistent with prior lacunar
infarction, unchanged from prior studies. The Earthy Mastrovito-white matter
differentiation appears preserved. There has been interval
opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. There is
minimal thickening of the right maxillary sinus. The visualized
soft tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage. Evidence of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease as well as prior lacunar infarcts,
unchanged.

2008-11-10 00:00:00 CT abd/pelvis
69 year old woman with diffuse, persistent abdominal pain, s/p
PEA arrest, elevated lactate
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for mesenteric ischemia - angiogram protocol
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Diffuse persistent abdominal pain status post PEA
arrest with elevated lactate. Concern for mesenteric ischemia.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Tiny (2 mm)
nodule seen within the left lower lobe, not clearly visualized
at the time of the 123 Any St.us CT examinations. The visualized
portions of the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. The
liver, spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.
Gallbladder contains a calcified stone in layering calcium
consistent with milk of calcium. There is stranding about the
inferior aspect of the pancreas within the mesenteric root. The
aorta is normal in caliber with mural calcifications consistent
with atheromatous disease. The kidneys appear atrophic
bilaterally. The large and small bowel loops are normal in
caliber. There is mucosal thickening within a short segment of
cecum. No other areas of abnormal bowel wall thickening are
identified. There is no free intraperitoneal air and no free
fluid within the abdomen. There is no pathologic appearing
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder,
distal ureters, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
There are uterine calcifications. The uterus and adnexa appear
otherwise unremarkable. There is no pathologic appearing pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is diffuse stranding within
the subcutaneous tissues of the left buttock and right buttock
to a slightly less prominent degree. Multiple calcifications are
seen within the soft tissues of the buttocks consistent with
injection granulomas.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows demonstrate unusual contour of the
left femoral neck with bowing and heterogeneous lucency within
the femoral neck and greater trochanter. No suspicious lytic or
sclerotic osseous lesions are identified.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformations
demonstrate a short segment of mucosal thickening within the
cecum.

IMPRESSION:
1. Short segment of mucosal thickening within the cecum, finding
of uncertain significance. The differential diagnoses include
infectious, inflammatory, or ischemic colitis.
2. Peripancreatic stranding, finding that could indicate
pancreatitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
2 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. If there is no history of
prior malignancy, this may be further evaluated by follow-up CT
in 1 year.
4. Cholelithiasis and milk of calcium within the gallbladder.
5. Unusual configuration of the left femoral neck, finding that
could suggest etiology such as fibrous dysplasia


Brief Hospital Course:
ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY:
on 2008-11-10 00:00:00 she was admitted to the sda area anesthesia saw her
and had cocerns about her respiratory status and had a cxr done
it showed no pna and shecwas taken to the or and underwent a
left shoulder hemiarthroplasty transfered to pacu stable

MEDICINE:
Patient was transferred to medicine on 2008-11-10 00:00:00.  The plan at
that time was for patient to recive hemodialysis and to
discharged home.  While in hemodialysis, patient became
hypotensive.  House officer was called.  While attempting to get
an ABG, patient had respiratory arrest and a code blue was
activated. Patient was found to have pulseless electrical
activity.  Patient was successfully resuscitated and transferred
to the MICU.  CTA was positive for pulmonary embolism and
patient was started on Heparin.  Her EKG had ST and ST
depressions laterally and Echocardiogram showed no evidence of
right heart strain.  Her blood pressure stabilized and she was
transferred back to the floor on 2008-11-10 00:00:00.  The remainder of her
hospital course was characterized by persistent intermittent
episodes of hypotension down to the 80's systolic.  Measuring
blood pressure on Ms. Lafon is problemChynia Lafon as she has a healing
surgical wound on her left arm and her right has poor
vasculature, presumably from multiple past lines.  She was
regularly hypotensive (SBP 80's) during hemodialysis.  Her blood
pressure responded well to 250 cc normal saline boluses.

Of note, during this admission patient had one episode of
unresponsiveness.  Patient was treated with narcan with slight
improvement and aggressive electrolyte re123 Any St.n (phosphate and
magnesium).)  Vital signs were at her baseline throughout.  No
acute changes on CXR or ECG.  FSBG normal.  Head CT negative.
She returned to baseline over the course of 2008-11-10 00:00:00 hours and the
episode was attributed to excessive pain medications and
multiple electrolyte abnormalities.  The remainder of her
hospital course is organized by problem below:
.
#Anticoagulation: patient transitioned from heparin to coumadin
without incident.  Still attempting to titrate to maintain INR
between 2008-11-10 00:00:00. Her INR on the date of discharge was
supratherapeutic.  Her coumadin should be held on 2008-11-10 00:00:00 and
re-started on 2008-11-10 00:00:00 at 1 mg qhs IF her INR comes down to
therapeutic range (goal 2008-11-10 00:00:00).
.
#. Humeral Fracture: Films were reviewed by orthopedic surgery.
No fracture or damage to hardware during CPR evident on plain
film on 2008-11-10 00:00:00.  She will need follow up with orthopedics for
removal of stitches.
.
#Blood loss - On two occaisions patient's hematocrit drifted
down.  Neither could be entirely accounted for by surgery (per
ortho there was minimal blood loss, < 500 cc) or by the small
hematoma that developed at the surgical site.   Pt had guaiac
poitive stool on 2008-11-10 00:00:00, followed be several guiac negative
stools.  GI was conculted and they did not feel a colonoscopy
was advisable in this patient given her recent arrest and
current state of anticoagulation.  Patient also began to
complain of a new mild diffuse abdominal pain, we obtained an
abdominal CT scan which showed non-diagnostic bowel wall
thickening in the cecum but no concerning evidence of mesenteric
ischemia.  Patient's hemaocrit stablized after receiving one
unit of blood and the plan is for the patient to receive a
colonscopy as an outpatient.  She will need to follow up with
gastroenterology for this.
.
# Fever: Patient has intermittent fevers after returning to the
floor.  Patient was initially treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics.  PICC line was placed for access and femoral line
was discontinued with good resolution of fevers.  All cultures
returned negative.
.
#Diarrhea: Patient has very poor oral intake and has loose stool
from a predominatly liquid diet at baseline.  All stool cultures
were negative.  CT of the abdomnen was only notable for
non-specific ceccal wall thickening.  Patient was treated with
anti-diarrheal with some improvement in symtptoms.
.
#Hypernatremia: Stable.  Patient on HD.
.
#. ESRD: Hemodialysis
.
#. DM: Had one episode of hypotglycemia (35).  Glipizide was
decreased to 2.5 mg Q day and patient was maintained insuline
sliding scale.
.
# Hypophospatemia:  At one point patient's phosphate level
dropped down to 0.5 despite being started on neutraphos.
Patient has very poor oral intake and has loose stool from a
predominatly liquid diet at baseline.  Patient required
aggressive IV re123 Any St.n with a goal phosphate greater than 3.
.
#. FEN: Patient recieved multiple speech and swallow
evaluations.  She does not aspirate on thin liquids but it was
discovered that when coerced into eating solid food that she
would secrete it in her cheeks and later fall asleep and
aspirate large food particles.  At home patient eats a
predominatly liquid diet by preference.  Diet was changed to
full liquids with no further episodes of food aspiration
requiring suctioning.
.
#. FULL code: discussed with family
.
#. Communication: Through family as patient is Somalina speaking
ony and no translator was available.
