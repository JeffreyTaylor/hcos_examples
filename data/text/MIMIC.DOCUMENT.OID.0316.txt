Chief Complaint:
pneumonia, hypoxia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 66-yo man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
hepatitis C, h/o C.diff colitis, and a recent pneumonia,
discharged 2010-07-06 00:00:00 on Vanc / Zosyn, who was found by his family
to be more hypoxic and tired than usual so they brought him into
the ED. His wife found him to be more sick than usual at about
4pm today, needing more supplemental O2 than prior (2L -->
3-4L), feeling warm and looking Lorell Schmutte. She called EMS, who
brought him in to the ED today.
.
On arrival in the ED, VS - Temp 101.4F, 148/78, HR 98, R 28,
SaO2 99% NRB. He received Tylenol 650mg PR x2. Blood Cx sent x2,
UA negative. He was initially weaned down to 4L NC, but
desaturated to the 80s so was re-started on the NRB with
improvement to the mid-90s. Lactate was 2.6 and CXR showed a
possible right basilar pneumonia and a coiled PICC line. He
subsequently became hypotensive to the high-70s but was fluid
responsive. His PICC line was pulled and sent for Cx and a RIJ
CVL was placed, and he got 4L NS IVF with SBPs 95-100. ID was
curbsided regarding Abx coverage, and he received Vancomycin,
Meropenem, and Tobramycin for broad coverage. He is admitted to
the MICU for sepsis. He did not require any vasopressor support.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he feels well and has no complaints. He
acknowledges fever but denies SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, diarrhea, or swelling.

2010-07-06 00:00:00 CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2010-07-06 00:00:00, there is some
increasing
opacification at the right base medially with silhouetting of
the
hemidiaphragm, consistent with right middle lobe consolidation.
Mild
atelectatic changes at the left base with blunting of the
costophrenic angle persist. Upper lung zones remain clear.
.
2010-07-06 00:00:00 CXR:
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion.
1. Possible right basilar pneumonia. Recommend repeat radiograph
of the chest to confirm with more optimized technique.
2. Interval slight retraction of the right PICC which is looped
in the right subclavian vein.
.
2010-07-06 00:00:00 ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened/deformed. No discrete vegetation is seen, but cannot
be excluded due to suboptimal image quality and diffuse aortic
valve thickening. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-07-06 00:00:00,
the findings are similar.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on 2010-07-06 00:00:00 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
2010-07-06 00:00:00 Video swallow
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe oral and mild pharyngeal
dysphagia resulting in penetration and aspiration due to
premature spillover, delayed swallow initiation, and mildly
reduced laryngeal valve closure.
.
2010-07-06 00:00:00 CT head
NONCONTRAST CT HEAD: There is no intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, edema, mass
effect, or evidence of acute infarct.
Evidence of 123 Any St.us right 123 Any St.nal craniotomy and vascular
clip in the right ICA are unchanged since 2010-07-06 00:00:00.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity
represent chronic microvascular infarction, unchanged since
2010-07-06 00:00:00. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
2010-07-06 00:00:00 LE U/S
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT,
although there is limited visualization of the calf veins
bilaterally.
.
2010-07-06 00:00:00 CT Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right middle lobe consolidation with interval increase
in right
middle lobe volume loss without evidence of endobronchial
lesion. Several
enlarged and numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes not
significantly
changed from the prior study and likely reactive in nature.
2. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions right
greater than left.
3. Multiple bilateral 3-6 mm nodules, unchanged compared to the
prior study.
A followup CT is recommended in one year to ensure two-year
stability.
4. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 66M with a history of pAF, c.diff colitis,
recent pneumonia, admitted to the ICU with recurrent PNA/sepsis
and found to have RML/RLL PNA & and being empirically tx for c
diff colitis.
.
# Pneumonia: The patient was admitted with high fever, hypoxia,
and hypotension. His CXR showed evidence of a RML/RLL pneumonia
thought to be due to aspiration given dysphagia on swallow
study. He was treated with a 14 day course of meropenem which
was completed today.  He does have pleural effusions but no
thoracentesis was done given that it was difficult to position
the patient and there was not enough fluid to safely tap. He was
gently diuresed during his admission. His CT scan showed
pulmonary nodules that need to be followed up as an outpatint.
Given his repeated pneumonias checked HIV Ab and IgG both
unremarkable.  His b-glucan came back at >500 pg/mL.  Given his
clinical improvement and no known reason for immunocompromise he
was not treated for a fungal infection.  This lab should be
redrawn in 2010-07-06 00:00:00 weeks after discharge to ensure that it improves.
 A galactomannan was drawn while he was in the ICU and should be
followed up as an outpatint.  He was placed on a dysphagia diet
given concern for repeat aspiration PNA and failure of swallow
study.  He required 3L of oxygen at the time of discharge (he
had 2L oxygen requirement prior to admisison).
.
# Fever/ Sepsis: Pt has septic physiology in the ED and MICU.
She grew gram + cocci in clusters in 1 bottle anaerobic from
2010-07-06 00:00:00 and was started on vancomycin IV which she received for
one day until it came back coag negative staph. His last fever
was 2010-07-06 00:00:00.  All other blood cx have been negative. His urine
cx was negative (except for Jamayia Sabillon).  His fever/sepsis was
treated with a 14 day course of meropenem as detailed above
under the PNA section.
.
# Diarrhea: The patient had diarrhea while in the ICU.  He was
empirically treatment for c.diff although he was c diff negative
x3 during this hospitalizatoin. He had 5 BM the day prior to
discharge some of which were loose stools.  Given his com123 Any St.n
of meropenem on 2010-07-06 00:00:00 the patient will be given an additional
7 day course of flagyl with the last dose the eveing of 2010-07-06 00:00:00.
 His diarrhea may not be c diff in origin and could just be due
to his meropenem.
.
# Anisicoria: Anisicoria was noticed on exam with R eye dilated
more than left.  This is an old finding for the patient as he
has a PCOM aneurysm compressing CN III.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is being continued
on his home dose of Flecainide and Digoxin.  His metoprolol was
decreased to UPMCE on 2010-07-06 00:00:00 given occassional low HR and at times
his metoprolol still needs to be held for decreased BP.  He is
being continued on aspirin. Per a discussion the ICU team had
with his PCP and cardiology he is not being anticoagulation
given his history of falls.  On the medicine floor he did not
have a fib with RVR, however, he is at higher risk for RVR given
that he was started on ritalin. However, given his decreased
affect and the positive effect of ritalin on his energy level we
have continued the ritalin.
.
#Anemia: His HCT has been stable at approximately 30.  The
anemia is macrocytic and likely from liver disease. His recent
B12/Folate were within normal limits.  His ferrous sulfate
supplement should be continued.
.
# Psych: The patient has bipolar disorder and has been stable on
Depakote for several years with no recent changes. In the ICU
there was concern for somnolence and his flat affect and his
Zyprexa was discontinued. Given his decreased energy level he
was started on ritalin (2010-07-06 00:00:00) which he has responded to.  His
outpatient psychiatrist Dr. Sabillon is aware of these changes.  I
spoke with Dr. Sabillon about our concern for his depression and he
was started on citalopram 20mg daily (2010-07-06 00:00:00) which should be
increased to 30mg daily (on 2010-07-06 00:00:00) if he does well on it.
Given his history of bipolar disorder he needs to be closely
monitored for symptoms of mania since his zyprexa was stopped
and citalopram was started. He varied from A & O x2 to 3.  He
does not always participate when asked date. His mental status
can wax and wanes sometimes with the patient not always
answering questions in an appropriate time frame especially in
evening.  His affect is flat and his thinking is very slow.
.
Severe dry eyes and keratitis: also saw the patient and found
severe dry eyes and keratitis of the right eye.  Continue
aritifical tears.
.
# ? Liver disease: There is concern for liver disease given AP
408, AST 89, INR 1.4, and mild thrombocytopenia.  He was Hep C
Ab neg. His Hep B serologies were consistent with prior
infection (surface and core Ab+). He hoes have a remote history
of heavy alcohol use.  He needs outpatient liver follow up after
he leaves rehab.
.
# Bradycardia/Hypotension: he had a few short episodes of
bradycardia and hypotension on arrival to ED which resolved.  He
has some low BPs in the ICU. He also had some SBP in the high
80s/low 90s while on the medicine floor and he was
assymptomatic.
.
# Nutrition: He is on a dysphagia diet: PO diet nectar thick
liquids, soft solids, and pills whole with puree or nectar thick
liquid.  He aspirated liquids when he takes large sips. At rehab
he can take small sips of regular liquids between meals if he is
undersupervison.  He still has severe LE edema which is likely
influenced by poor nutrition.
.
# Prophylaxis:
-DVT: heparin sc. No anticoagulation for A fib (see above)
-Stress ulcer: H2 blocker

aspirating thin liquids. You are being discharged on the
following diet: nectar thick liquids, soft solids, pills whole
with puree or nectar thick liquids.  You can have regular
liquids between meals but ONLY IF YOU TAKE SMALL SIPS AND
SOMEONE SUPERVISES YOU. If you take large sips you will likely
aspirate again.
You also developed diarrhea and you were treated with flagyl
although your stool never tested positive for c diff.  You need
to take 7 more days of flagyl to continue to treat your
diarrhea.
