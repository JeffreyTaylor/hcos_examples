in his hematocrit from 30.0 to 20.6.  The patient denies any
chest pain or short of breath.  He is admitted for urgent
repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 8 cm in size.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Shows vital signs 96.1, 142/86, 90,
18, room air sat was 96%  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
exam is unremarkable.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs
are clear to auscultation.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen is distended with bowel sounds, is nontender.  There
is no bruits.  Extremities have palpable femoral pulses
bilaterally without distal dorsalis pedis bilaterally.  The
rectal exam was guaiac negative.

LABS:  Hematocrit of 20.6 with a white count of 16.5, BUN 42,

Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions with pleural
plaques, the right greater than the left.

Electrocardiogram was without acute changes.  Normal sinus
rhythm.

The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  He was then transfused 12
units of packed red blood cells and also received 5 units of
FFP and two units of platelets intraoperatively.  He remained
intubated, was transferred to the SICU for continued
monitoring and care.  His SICU course was prolonged and
complicated by respiratory failure.  He had multiple blood
cultures drawn and urine cultures obtained because of failure
to wean.  His sputum cultures were on 2013-11-15 00:00:00 negative.  His
urine culture on 2013-11-15 00:00:00 and 2013-11-15 00:00:00 were negative.  He underwent
a bronchoscopy on 2013-11-15 00:00:00 with Endotracheal tube change at that
time.  There were no blockages seen, vocal cords were normal
and there was mild bronchial edema on the mucosa,
endotracheal bronchial tree.  The right IJ cortise was
converted to a central line on 2013-11-15 00:00:00 and required left
subclavian line placement later that day.  The patient
remained intubated, chest x-ray remained unremarkable except
for the bilateral pleural effusions and some basilar
atelectasis.

The patient was finally extubated on 2013-11-15 00:00:00.  Physical
therapy was requested for evaluation.  During this period in
SICU the patient required TPN and tube feed support.

On 2013-11-15 00:00:00 the patient passed flatus and had a bowel
movement.  He was then at that time transferred to MICU for
continued monitoring and care.

On 2013-11-15 00:00:00 the left subclavian line was changed to left IJ.  He
was begun on p.o.'s and diet advanced as tolerated.  The TPN
and tube feeds were discontinued after caloric intake was
evaluated.

On 2013-11-15 00:00:00 the patient became tachypneic and tachycardiac.
Electrocardiogram was without acute ischemic changes.  A
chest x-ray was unchanged.  The chest CT was negative for
pulmonary embolism.  Abdominal CT showed distended
gallbladder.  His liver function tests were elevated with an
ALT of 94, AST 81, Alk phos 293, total bili 6.9, Lipase 73,
amylase 106, lactate was 1.8, blood gases 7.38, 31, 99 and 13
with an elevated white count of 33.0 with a T-max of 102.6.
The patient required re-intubation and transfer to the SICU.
Gastrointestinal was consulted.  An ultrasound of the
gallbladder was obtained and needle aspirate was done.  The
patient was empirically begun on Unasyn.  The cultures of the
blood, urine, sputum and gallbladder were no growth.  The
Infectious Disease was consulted at this time.  He was
empirically started on Unasyn, Vancomycin and Flagyl.  CK and
Troponin levels were obtained and they were flat.

On 2013-11-15 00:00:00 the patient was extubated without incident and the
right subclavian line was changed.  Cultures were sent to the
line, at this point of the dictation are no growth but not
finalized.  Vancomycin was discontinued.  Oxacillin was begun
on 2013-11-15 00:00:00 2 grams q 6 hours for suspected line sepsis.  The
Nasogastric tube was removed.  His diet was advanced as
tolerated on 2013-11-15 00:00:00.  PICC line was placed and the central
line was discontinued. He received two units of packed cells
for hematocrit.  Oxacillin was started for the enterococcus
which was 10,000 to 100,000 organisms in his urine culture
and sensitivity on 2013-11-15 00:00:00.

The transfusion was for a hematocrit of 26.7, he received two
