History of Present Illness:
84 yo m hx of CHF EF of 40% who was transfered form rehab due to
worsening of SOB and ARF.  He was recetly admitted from
2009-09-13 00:00:00 and discharge to rehab. He was on lasix 80mg UPMCE, then
2 days ago, lasix was adjusted to 80mg AM and 40mg PM. Per rehab
his Cr has been trendeding up and his dypsnea has been
worsening. At discharge his Cr was 0.9, then 1.1 and now 2.2
today. UO has been decreased per pt. Wt gains of 2 lbs over last
few days.
.
During his last hopsitalization he was treated for a sternal
wound infection from his CABG on 2009-09-13 00:00:00. On 2009-09-13 00:00:00 he had a
debridement and wound closer, with pacer lead removal on 2009-09-13 00:00:00.
Epicardial leads were paritally removed. Old PPM remained in
place. He also had a flap closure. Culture of his infeciton
showed MSSA. He developed AIN, so his antibiotics were changed
to vancomycin. He will be on lifelong sup123 Any St.e therapy after
his regiment of IV therapy. Hardware in the sternum is in place.
His stay was complicated by CHF and ARF from diuresis, later
this improved to a Cr of 0.9 and he was sent to rehab.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.8 67 128/58 20 94% 3L NC. Pt
was given 250mg IVF over 2 hours. Pt's oxygen was increased to
4L. On transfer temp 97.9 67 120/45 18 96% 4 liters. CXR with
pulm edema. Pt admitted to UPMCE.

2009-09-13 00:00:00 CXR:
Studies:
The patient's sternotomy fixators are unchanged in appearance.
The pacemakerleads are unchanged in appearance as well. The
temporary pacemaker leads projecting at the expected location of
the left epicardium are unchanged as well. Left PICC line tip is
obscured by the pacemaker but is most likely not extending
beyond the junction of the axillary vein and the subclavian
vein. Bilateral pleural effusions have slightly improved.
Bibasilar atelectases are unchanged.
.
2009-09-13 00:00:00 LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
leg.

2009-09-13 00:00:00 CXR
Portable chest is compared to multiple prior examinations.
Sternal plates,
dual-lead pacer is present. Mild-to-moderate congestive failure,
new from
prior study from 2009-09-13 00:00:00. Right IJ Cordis terminates in the
superior vena cava. No pneumothorax.

ECHO 2009-09-13 00:00:00: EF 30-35%. Suboptimal image quality. Regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of 2009-09-13 00:00:00, regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction appears to be more extensive, and the
severity of mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitaiton, and
PA systolic pressure are all increased.

2009-09-13 00:00:00 AP-L & Decubitus CXR
The decubitus images in both the left position show moderate
bilateral pleural effusions. The right effusion is minimally
more extensive than the left effusion. With respect to the
sternal fixations, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the
aspect of the lung parenchyma, today's images
provide no new information.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yoM with hx of CAD s/p recent CABG c/b sternal wound MSSA
infection, CHF and ARF, now presenting with dyspnea and Leffler.
.
Active Issues Upon Discharge:
# Leffler: Thought to be multifactorial, with the underlying
123 Any St.itant AIN secondary to the significant nephrotoxic
antibiotic load the patient received for MSSA treatment;
decreased effective circulatory volume due to CHF decompensation
was likely to also be a contributor to pre-renal
pathophysiology. On presentation, the patient was hyperkalemic,
prompting the administration of Kayexalate, which normalized his
potassium. Following consultation with Infectious Disease and
Nephrology, IV vancomycin was stopped during the 6th of 8 weeks
of treatment; at this time, the patient's vancomycin trough was
supratherapeutic. To optimize volume status and forward flow,
CVVH was started and continued until the patient was net -10L;
the patient's home acetazolamide and furosemide were held.
Hemodialysis was started and patient remained oliguric after two
sessions. As a result, a tunneled hemodialysis catheter was
placed and patient was set up for outpatient hemodialysis.
Of note, he has made minimal urine during his hospital stay.
His largest urine output was 250 cc.  However, the day before
discharge he had no urine output.
- Leave R side suture above catheter in place until 2009-09-13 00:00:00.
- Dialysis as an outpatient.  Last dialysis 2009-09-13 00:00:00.
.
# Dyspnea: The patient was admitted with worsening heart failure
symptoms with the most recent echo showing an EF of 40-45% in
the setting of known COPD. Diuresis was initially attempted with
IV Lasix and drip, but the patient was eventually transitioned
to CVVH and diuresed aggressively with subsequent improvement of
his clinical exam and symptoms; he remained rate controlled with
metoprolol 50 mg TID (decreased from admission dose) and ACEi
was held in the setting of Leffler but started upon discharge.
During the hospitalization, he was kept on a COPD regimen of
Guaifenesin, ipratropium / albuterol nebs, and fluticasone. CXR
upon discharged showed L pleural effusion, with decreased/absent
R pleural effusion.  He has good ambulatory saturation and will
require continued HD.  It is expected that his left pleural
effusion will decrease with continued HD.
- HD as above
.
# MSSA Sternal wound infection: Infectious Disease was
consulted; their recommendations were to stop IV Vancomycin on
week 6 of 8 of therapy and to start Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg
PO Q12H PO (d1 2009-09-13 00:00:00) for chronic suppressive therapy given his
indwelling hardware. Plastic Surgery was consulted for serous
wound drainage; their impression was that the wound was not
infected and recommended to continue wound care and suppressive
therapy without further changes. Patient will follow up with
Plastics as an outpatient.
- Continue Doxycycline (requires life long suppressive therapy)
.
# Anxiety: Patient become anxious at night, and states that he
has fears regarding his estate planning and continued medical
management.  He was not given any benzodiazepines secondary to
his history of hypercapnia.  He was started on low dose
olanzapine.
- Continue olanzapine 2.5 mg
- Please do not give benzodiazepines
.
Inactive Issues Upon Discharge:
# Hypercapnia / Hypoxia: COPD = chronic retainer. Serial ABGs
reassuring for decreased CO2, but O2 in 50s. Respiratory drive
hypoxia driven. Normalized during hospitalization.
- Please avoid central acting pain medications
- Please avoid benzodiazepines
.
#Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: EF 30-35%, and mitral
regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitaiton, and elevated PA systolic
pressures.
- Continue Metoprolol Succinate 100 mg daily
- Continue Lisinopril 2.5 mg Daily
.
# CAD:
- Continue Atorvastatin 10 mg PO/NG DAILY
- Continue Aspirin 325 mg PO/NG DAILY
.
# AMS Change: Toxic metabolic delirium; hypoxia unlikely because
AMS predated hypoxia. Likely multifactorial (low threshold given
age, azotemia, ICU setting.) Resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Anemia: Stable during admission ~27. Normocytic.
.
# R LE swelling: Likely secondary to CHF; LENIs negative.
.
# Poor nutrition: A nutrition consult was placed. Albumin
returned at 3. Speech and swallow cleared him for full solids
and thin liquids.
.
# The patient remained full code during this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr Leffler,
It was a pleasure caring for you at UPMCE. You were admitted for worsening shortness of
breath and also for decreasing kidney function. We helped remove
fluid using medications and different types of dialysis.
Unfortunately, your kidneys did not completely recover function
and so we placed a hemodialysis catheter so that you can have
hemodialysis as an outpatient.
.
Also while you were here, we started your antibiotic Doxycycline
for your past chest wound infection. You will be on this
indefinitely to prevent further infections.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
STOPPED Vancomycin and STARTED Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily
STOPPED Metoprolol 75 mg three times daily and STARTED Toprol XL
100 mg daily.
STOPPED Lasix.
STARTED Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily (only take on days that you are
not going to hemodialysis.)
STOPPED Clonazepam and STARTED Olanzapine 2.5 mg daily. You were
confused with clonazepam type medicine so we have discontinued
them.
STOPPED Fluticasone spray per your request
.
Your follow-up appointments are listed below.
.
Please also weigh yourself every morning before dialysis.

Followup Instructions:
HEMODIALYSIS: every Tues/Thurs/Sat
