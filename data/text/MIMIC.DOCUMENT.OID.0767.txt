Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
72 year old female with ESLD/HCV cirrhosis admitted with altered
mental status, hypotension, abdominal pain, and gram negative
rod sepsis.

# Septic Shock:  Patient found to have pansensitive klebsiella
bacteremia and enterococcus UTI.  She was initially on
vanc/cipro but was transitioned to cefepime for a 14-day course
given the bacteremia.  She was weaned off pressors and did well.
 Transplant surgery followed the patient while here.  She
received a liver on 2007-06-02 00:00:00 and was then transferred to the
transplant surgery team.
.
# SBP: Patient has SBP by criteria in setting of normal para
2007-06-02 00:00:00.  Unfortunately, no culture of peritoneal fluid.  Received
albumin.  Will need lifelong prophylaxis after finished course
with cipro

# Volume overload: Patient became grossly positive while here.
She had rales on exam.  She was diuresed with IV lasix with good
response.

# Encephalopathy: Likely 2007-06-02 00:00:00 infection or hepatic
encephalopathy.  Initially worsened but improved with lactulose
and rifaximin.  Her infections were treated appropriately.  She
did develop myoclonus on 2007-06-02 00:00:00 so the neurology team was
consulted.  123 Any St. etiology of myclonus is toxic-metabolic.

# Coagulopathy: Patient received FFP, cryo and platelets while
here as she developed slightly low fibrinogen but normal fibrin
split products.  Also had elevated INR and decreased Hct.
Coags, Hct, platelets were monitored closely. This was resolved
following liver transplant.

# Carrara: Was likely secondary to decreased perfusion vs ATN from
hypotension. She received volume expansion with blood products
and creatinine returned to 123 Any St. by 2007-06-02 00:00:00.  SBP was treated with
albumin and cefepime.

# ESLD/HCV cirrhosis: ALT, AST, bili, INR at baseline. Now with
evidence of SBP.  Patient given rifaximin and lactulose.  Her
home doses of spironolactone and lasix were held in the setting
of hypotension.  Hepatology team followed patient while she was
here. She was considered appropriately covered and was taken to
the OR for liver transplant on 2007-06-02 00:00:00 and then transferred to the
transplant surgery service.

In the immediate post op period, the patient was kept in the ICU
through POD 10. She was kept on Cefepime following transplant to
continue SBP treatment. Blood cultures had been taken on the day
prior to transplant and were returned following the surgery with
Vanco sensitive enterococcus. She was treated with 14 days of
Vancomycin. She remained afebrile throughout the rest of the
hospitalization.
There was some difficulty in getting her extubated, and volume
overload was noted to be present. She underwent aggresive
diuresis with lasix intermittently and then as a drip. She was
extubated successfully, but required re-intubation due to mental
status issues and increased oxygen requirements. She was still
having a small oxygen requirement that continues to be weaned.
The patient has been receiving tube feeds via a Dobhoff feeding
tube in the jejuneum. She has intermittently pulled the tube out
but is discharged with the feeding tube in place. Tube feeds
were changed to accomadate difficult to control blood glucoses.
She was also followed by Carrara during the hospitalization whio
assisted in blood glucose management.
