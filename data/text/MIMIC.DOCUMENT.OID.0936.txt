Attending:Keiyara Almejo
Chief Complaint:
Chest burning, mild SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2011-01-13 00:00:00 Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending;
saphenous vein grafts to obtuse marginal and posterior
descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant 55 year-old man who reported a vague
"burning" feeling in his chest that began in 2011-01-13 00:00:00 of this year.
He also reports an associated mild SOB. This burning sensation
has occurred with activity such as walking up a steep incline or
even on a flat surface, occasionally depending on what he had
just eaten. Mr. Coello also notes the burning sensation has
occurred at rest, but can be postural - depending on if he is
sitting vs. laying down. The patient often associates most of
these symptoms with his GERD. Finally, the patient also reports
a tightness in the area of his heart that was also tender to
touch. This has occurred with and without activity, with stress
and could last up to one day. On 2011-01-13 00:00:00, the patient underwent
an ETT for CP evaluation. The patient for 5.25 minutes of a
modified Keiyara Almejo protocol to an APHR of 65% and was stopped for
fatigue. At peak exercise, EKG showed 1-1.5mm of horizontal ST
segment depression in II and lateral leads. These changes turned
to downsloping by 3 minutes post-exercise, and returned to
baseline by 7 minutes of recovery. The rhythm was sinus without
ectopy. Gated images revealed a large, reversible, moderate
intensity perfusion defect involving the PDA territory. Small,
reversible, severe perfusion defect involving the LAD territory.
Transient cavity dilation c/w severe multi-vessel disease.
Moderate LV systolic dysfunction (EF 34%), with apical and
inferior hypokinesis, c/w post-stress running. On 2011-01-13 00:00:00,
patient underwent cardiac catheterization which showed severe
three vessel disease and depressed left ventricular function at
35%. Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with
90% stenosis of the LAD and total occlusions of the second
obtuse marginal and mid right coronary artery. PCI of the RCA
was attempted but unsuccessful. He was therefore referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, Mr. Coello was brought to the operating room and
underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr.
Keiyara Almejo. The operation was uneventful. Following the
procedure, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. He maintained stable hemodynamics as he weaned from
inotropic support. His CSRU course was otherwise uncomplicated
and he transferred to the SDU on postoperative day three. He
continued to require diuresis. Over the next several days,
medical therapy was optimized. Beta blockade was resumed with
most of his other preoperative medications. He remained in a
normal sinus rhythm. By discharge, he was near his preoperative
weight with room air oxygen saturations of 97%. His discharge
chest x-ray was notable for only a resolving left pleural
effusion. At time of discharge his blood pressure was 127/69
with a heart rate of 85 in sinus. All surgical wounds were
clean, dry and intact. He will need to remain on supplemental
Iron as an outpatient for his anemia.
