that showed an EF of 60 percent with an aortic valve area of
0.9, and a peak gradient of 96, and a mean gradient of 60,
with mild LVH, 1 plus AI, and 1 plus TR.  She had a cardiac
cath done 2010-11-14 00:00:00 that showed an aortic valve gradient of
56, with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2, an EF of 56
percent, RCA 40 percent, left main 20 percent, and an LAD 30
percent lesion.

but she does have a radiated murmur.  Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart regular rate and rhythm with
a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well-perfused with 1-2 plus edema,
right greater than left.  VARICOSITIES:  None.
Neurologically alert and oriented x 3.  Nonfocal exam.
PULSES:  Femoral 2 plus bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis 1 plus
bilaterally.  Posterior tibial 1 plus bilateral.  Radial 2
plus bilaterally.

Carotid ultrasound showed less than 40 percent stenosis
bilaterally.

LABS:  White count 4.5, hematocrit 32, platelets 234, PT
12.8, INR 1.0, sodium 139, potassium 3.2, chloride 100, CO2
28, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 122, ALT 13, AST 22, alk
phos 82, amylase 78, total bili 0.5, albumin 4.0, hemoglobin
A1C 5.1.  Chest x-ray showed no CHF or pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On 2010-11-14 00:00:00, the patient was directly
admitted to the operating room where she underwent an aortic
valve replacement with a number 23 mm Breitbach-Jasye Mantzke
tissue valve.  Her bypass time was 142 minutes with a
crossclamp time of 102 minutes.  She tolerated the operation
well and was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient was in a normal sinus rhythm at 85 beats per
minute, with a mean arterial pressure of 67 and a CVP of 15.
She had propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min and Neo-Synephrine at 0.15
mcg/kg/min.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  Throughout that
period, she remained hemodynamically stable, as she did
throughout the operative day.  However, she did require a
Nipride drip to maintain a blood pressure between 100 and
110.

On postoperative day 1, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  She was begun on oral medications
and weaned off of her Nipride drip.  Additionally, her chest
tubes were removed, and she was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Once on the floor, the patient had an uneventful hospital
course.  Her activity level was increased with the assistance
of the nursing staff, as well as physical therapy.

On postoperative day 3, her temporary pacing wires and her
Foley catheter were removed.  Over the next 2 days, her
activity level was further advanced with nursing and physical
therapy assistance, and on postoperative day 6, it was
decided that the patient was stable and ready to be
discharged to home.

DISCHARGE VITALS:  Temperature 98.3, heart rate 81--sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 128/66, respiratory rate 22, O2 sat 94
percent on room,  weight preoperatively 63 kg, at discharge
60.1 kg.

LAB DATA:  Hematocrit 29.4, sodium 142, potassium 3.5,
chloride 102, CO2 34, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 98.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x 3.
Moves all extremities.  Follows commands.  Nonfocal exam.
RESPIRATORY:  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, with no murmur.
Sternum is stable.  Incision with Steri-Strips, open to air,
clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well-
perfused with no edema.
