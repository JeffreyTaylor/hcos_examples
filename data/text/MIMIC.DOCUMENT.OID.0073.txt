.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm with delayed R wave
progression which is non-specific. Compared to the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2010-12-04 00:00:00 there is no significant change.
.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 CXR: FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits given leftward rotation. No radiographic
evidence of pneumonia is detected. Pulmonary vascularity appears
within normal limits. No effusion or pneumothorax. Arm in the
down position limits evaluation on the lateral
radiograph. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia
given limitations.
.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with early
involutional changes. No acute fractures are identified. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 PORTABLE ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Single frontal radiograph
of the abdomen shows a non-obstructive nondilated bowel gas
pattern. There is no free gas or pneumatosis. A mild amount of
retained fecal material is present. Visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable and there are no soft tissue
calcifications. IMPRESSION: 1. No radiographic evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 RIGHT ANKLE X-RAY: FINDINGS: Four views of the right
ankle are submitted. Screw tracts are present in the distal
fibula and there is residual osseous deformity from prior
fracture. The fracture is healed. The talus is abnormally
rotated with respect to the calcaneus and there is a medial
talar tilt. There is abnormal varus angulation of the foot. No
osseous findings to suggest osteomyelitis at this time.
.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Two frontal and two lateral
decubitus radiographs of the abdomen are interpreted in
comparison with radiograph from 2010-12-04 00:00:00. Images show
an air-filled colon with associated minimal dilatation. Note is
made of a paucity of bowel gas in the area of the rectum.
Decubitus view show scattered air-fluid levels within the colon.
The small bowel shows scattered air-filled loops with no
dilatation. There is no free air and there is no pneumatosis.
Tiny pelvic phlebolith is seen as well as a 10 x 7 mm ovoid
calcific density in the deep pelvis which is unchanged when
compared to CT studies from 2010-12-04 00:00:00. Visualized osseous
structures are notable for a mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.
IMPRESSION: Air-filled loop of colon with minimal dilatation,
though a paucity of gas is seen in the rectum and distal sigmoid
overall concerning for possible obstruction in the appropriate
clinical setting.
.
2010-12-04 00:00:00 CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:
- CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are left greater
than right bibasilar opacities, likely representing atelectasis,
left basal opacity is slightly more concerning for aspiration.
There is thickening of the distal esophagus. The liver, spleen,
adrenal glands, pancreas are unremarkable. Kidneys enhance
equally and excrete contrast normally. There is no free air, no
free fluid, no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal loops of small bowel are
not dilated. The contrast passes through the small bowel into
the colon, reaching distal transverse colon. There is fecal
material and gas noted throughout the descending colon as well
as gas present in the rectum. Normal appendix is seen. The cecum
is very large and displaces the sigmoid colon.
- CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon
are unremarkable. Urinary bladder wall demonstrates concentric
thickening, which may be due to underdistension, chronic UTI can
have this appearance. There is no pelvic fluid and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
Bilateral inguinal nodes measure up to 9 mm in short axis
diameter. The prostate is enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse
dimension.
- BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Anterior compression deformity of T12 vertebral body is
stable.
- IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of small bowel obstruction or stool impaction.
Distended cecum with mass effect on the sigmoid, intermittent
obstruction may be result.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis, left lower lobe opacity is concerning
for aspiration if the patient is at risk.
3. Concentric urinary bladder wall thickening, greater in extent
compared to the prior study. Cystitis can also have this
appearance; outlet obstruction less likely given more normal
appearance on 2010-12-04 00:00:00 studies.

2010-12-04 00:00:00 ENDOSCOPY:Erythema and congestion and superficial
erosion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with mild
esophagitis
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Erythema and
congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with mild
gastritis (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the first part of the
duodenum, second part of the duodenum and third part of the
duodenum (biopsy) Small hiatal hernia

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old man with a history of presumed 123 Any St. Gastaut
Syndrome and epilepsy presents with a in the setting of fever.
.
# Seizures: Patient has a well-known seizures history due to
123 Any St. Gastaut, although his 123 Any St. believes his
presentation may have been due to an episode of rigors in the
setting of fever and leukocytosis. Corrected phenytoin level was
9.1 on admission, and he received additional phenytoin 300 mg IV
x 1. CT head negative. Infectious work-up remarkable only for
UTI, for which pt completed a 7-day course of
amoxicillin/ampicillin. He was switched back to outpatient oral
phenytoin dose but continued to have seizures lasting up to half
a minute, which was determined by neurology to be consistent
with baseline seizures. Rechecked corrected phenytoin level was
5, and pt given additional bolus of phenytoin 150 mg IV and then
started on increased dose of phenytoin 150 mg po bid. Phenytoin
and albumin levels should be followed to ensure therapeutic
level of 2010-12-04 00:00:00; level was 7.2 on day of discharge, neurology
called, recommended rechecking level in 2010-12-04 00:00:00 weeks with albumin.
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Per 2010-12-04 00:00:00, patient with fevers on
and off for months so fever work-up initiated. Lactate nl, RF
slightly elevated. CXR negative. Vancomycin discontinued as LP
without evidence. Ceftriaxone stopped and continued on
ampicillin/amoxicillin (dependent on NPO status) for UTI, which
grew out VRE. As patient initially still spiking fevers with
markedly elevated CRP, R foot x-ray done to rule out R ankle
osteomyelitis given history of this. Patient subsequently
defervesced and leukocytosis resolved. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed left greater than right bibasilar opacities, likely
representing atelectasis, but left basal opacity slightly more
concerning for aspiration. Unable to correlate with exam as
limited by cooperation but as pt remained afebrile off
antibiotics and as evaluated on this admission by Speech/Swallow
with no signs of aspiration, did not pursue further work-up.
Would recommend repeat CXR if pt does spike a new fever.
.
# Enterococcus UTI: As above, completed 7-day course of
antibiotics.
.
# ?Aspiration pneumonia: Reevaluated by Speech/Swallow on this
admission with no evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.
Recommended to continue ground diet, thin liquids, and whole
pills mixed with food. Questionable left-sided aspiration
pneumonia on CT abd/pelvis as above; would repeat CXR if pt
spikes new fever.
.
# R/o Barrett's esophagus: Pt scheduled for outpatient endoscopy
to evaluate this but done as inpatient. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed thickening of the distal
esophagus. Pt underwent endoscopy on 2010-12-04 00:00:00 which showed
concern for Barrett's esophagus.  Biopsies will need to be
followed up.
.
# Anemia: Hct remained stable but given h/o iron deficiency
anemia also seen on labs on this admission, pt repleted with IV
iron and discharged with oral iron supplements. Attempt made to
perform colonoscopy as inpatient given this and as pt nearing
routine screening age but was hampered by inadequate bowel prep
despite prolonged efforts involving multiple bottles of mag
citrate and tap water enemas. Would still recommend pursuing in
the long run given persistent iron deficiency anemia and
possibility of detecting colon cancer at an early stage.
.
# Constipation: Pt inadequately bowel prepped for colonoscopy
likely secondary to high rectal stool impaction out of reach
manually. However, abdomen soft with no evidence of obstruction
on CT abd/pelvis. Would recommend maintaining a good, regular
bowel regimen daily as outpatient to prevent stool impaction,
especially in anticipation of need for outpatient colonoscopy in
the future.
.
# Enlarged prostate: Per CT abdomen/pelvis, the prostate is
enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse dimension. Pt able to void
bladder. Would follow up as outpatient.
.
# Transaminitis: Mild elevation which subsequently resolved.
Abdominal exam benign. 2010-12-04 00:00:00 have been secondary to med effect v.
viral infection. Viral hepatitis panel negative.
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Thought to be secondary to dilantin.
Continued on outpatient Vitamin B12
.
# Mental Retardation: Mental status at baseline as per attendant
from group home.
