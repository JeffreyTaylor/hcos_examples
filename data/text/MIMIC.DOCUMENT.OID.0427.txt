History of Present Illness:
60 y.o. M with hx of ESRD s/p cadaveric renal tx in 2010-06-12 00:00:00, on
immunosuppressants, Hep C, HTN, [**Year (4 digits) 2286**], PVD presents from home
with  fever to 105.8.  Patient says he was in his usual state of
health as recently as Weds, when he saw his cardiologist in
preparation for hernia repair surgery early next week.  Some of
his usual medications including his prophylactic bactrim were
held and he stayed home from work trying to avoid sick contacts
pre-operatively.  On Thursday afternoon he started to feel some
malaise and his temperature started to rise.  He took some
tylenol and his fever appeared initially to abate, but returned
[**Year (4 digits) 2928**] with nausea and vomiting, constant shivering, shoulder
aches, headaches, and three episodes of loose stools.  Denies
any urinary symptoms (no changes in color, consistency, dysuria,
frequency, urgency), abd pain, neck stiffness, cough or cold
symptoms.  No sick contacts.  Evelyn Hannemann recent travel.  He was last
admitted to UPMCE from 2010-06-12 00:00:00 to 2010-06-12 00:00:00 for new diagnosis of atrial
flutter, acute on chronic renal failure and HAP.
.
In the ED, patient had labs which showed and elevated white
count with a 10% bandemia.  He had a CXR which was negative for
any acute process.  A R IJ line was placed and he was started on
Vancomycin and Gentamycin for presumptive endocarditis.  UA,
urine culture, and blood cultures were sent.  No recent invasive
dental work.  No recent IVDU.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Limited study, no evidence of PNA
.
ECHO (2010-06-12 00:00:00):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-06-12 00:00:00, the
aortic prosthesis gradient is significantly elevated. Preserved
systolic function with elevated filling pressures is similar.
.
CT Torso: 2010-06-12 00:00:00: IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased volume of air within the collecting system of the
transplant kidney. There is no significant perinephric stranding
about the transplant or about the transplant ureter. This
suggests possibility that this air may have been related to
Foley catheter insertion.
2. New ascites is seen within the peritoneal cavity which
extends into the patient's left inguinal hernia.
3. Increasing bilateral airspace opacities with infectious
etiologies as a differential consideration. Recommend clinical
correlation.
.
2010-06-12 00:00:00: LENI:
IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.
.
2010-06-12 00:00:00: CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 2010-06-12 00:00:00 and 17:
Mild pulmonary edema, seen best in perihilar left lung has
worsened slightly since 2010-06-12 00:00:00, accompanied by persistent
increase in caliber of mediastinal veins. Right lung base is
elevated, and atelectasis may explain consolidation in the right
lower lung, but I am more concerned this is pneumonia. Mild
cardiomegaly stable. Anatomic detail in the upper lungs is
obscured by radiographic technique. No pneumothorax is present.
Pleural effusion if any is minimal, on the right. Moderate
cardiomegaly unchanged. Right jugular line ends in the SVC.
.
2010-06-12 00:00:00: NC Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or large
2010-06-12 00:00:00 territory infarction; if suspicion for infarct is
present, MRI would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
2. Air-fluid levels in paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
may relate in part to recent intubation and recently removed NG
tube.
.
2010-06-12 00:00:00: RU Noninvasive: IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of
deep venous thrombosis in the right upper extremity. Right
cephalic vein was not visualized in the present exam.
.
2010-06-12 00:00:00: MR Evelyn Hannemann: FINDINGS: There is diffuse low signal
visualized in the vertebral bodies which could be due to marrow
hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical correlation
recommended. There is no evidence of ligamentous disruption seen
on limited evaluation on the sagittal inversion recovery images.
From C2-3 to C4-5 no significant disc bulge, herniation, spinal
stenosis or foraminal narrowing seen.
At C5-6 there is posterior ridging and bulging with mild spinal
stenosis and minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord.
Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing seen.
At C6-7 there is mild disc bulging and left-sided foraminal
narrowing seen.
At C7-T1 and T1-2 no significant abnormalities are noted. The
paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. The 123 Any St.usly noted
Evelyn Hannemann abnormality on the MRA of 2010-06-12 00:00:00 is not apparent on
the current study on axial images. The spinal cord shows normal
intrinsic signal.
IMPRESSION: Limited study with motion on the sagittal images.
Mild spinal stenosis at C5-6 with minimal extrinsic indentation
on the spinal cord. No evidence of increased signal within the
spinal cord. Other changes as described above.
.
2010-06-12 00:00:00: MR Evelyn Hannemann: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarct.
2. Chronic left frontal cortical and subcortical infarcts.
3. Low signal in the visualized bone marrow could be due to
marrow hyperplasia or infiltration. Clinical correlation
recommended.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of Evelyn Hannemann
occlusion or stenosis is seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60M PMH ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant in 2010-06-12 00:00:00 on
immunosuppressants, HBV/HCV, HTN, DM2 presented from home with
fever to 105.8, malaise, with nonspecific GI symptoms but no
other localizing signs or symptoms.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Due to pneumonia versus
infiltrates from sepsis with component of fluid overload which
improved after diuresis. Improved. Now extubated and doing well
on room air.  He was maintained on antibiotics as discussed
below for and has completed his course.
.
# Fever: The patient was followed by the infectious disease
teamand had an extensive infectious workup for possible source
of his fever. I the end no definitive source was found. It was
believed to be most likely pneumonia. Urinalysis was positive
but urine culture negative; CSF suggested possible Aseptic
meningitis; Rapid respiratory viral screen was negative; C.
difficile was negative x3; TTE was negative for vegetation to
suggest endocarditis; bronchoalveolar lavage was negative; LFTs
were normal. He became hemodynamically unstable 2010-06-12 00:00:00 requiring
aggressive volume resuscitation and pressors which were
discontinued on 2010-06-12 00:00:00.  He was covered broadly with vancomycin,
zosyn and flagyl, which were discontinued on 2010-06-12 00:00:00.  Infectious
Disease followed throughout his stay and also raised the
possibility of Addisonian crisis as an etiology of these
recurrent culture-negative septic episodes for which endocrine
follow up would be indicated. he was given a course of stress
dose steroids during his acute hypotension.
.
# Right sided Weakness: The patient was initially diffusely
weak, then localized on the right side, more upper than lower
extremity, with intact sensation. Swallowing, which was also
initially weak, began to improve and the patient passed his
swallow exam.  Noncontrast head CT scan was negative, MRI
c-spine and head were negative for acute abnormalities as well.
Weakness is possibly due to deconditioning thorughout prolonged
hospitalization and ICU stay. He was seen by physical therapy,
who recommended rehab stay for conditioning.
.
#Penile lesions: Pressure ulcers formed while in the ICU, both a
large frank ulcerated area on the glans penis (multiple smaller
ulcerated areas on the foreskin) for which he was seen by
urology, who recommended treatment with bacitracin with
improvement, and a sacral decubitus ulcer for which we have
tried turning patient and keeping him out of bed as much as
possible, as well as general wound care.
.
# Hypotension: Most likely this was secondary to septic shock,
also possibly  relative adrenal insufficiency given chronic
prednisone use. He was given Cortisol empiric high-dose steroids
2010-06-12 00:00:00 and discontinued 2010-06-12 00:00:00, without recurrence of hypotension.
He required pressors for a short period in the ICU. Blood
pressure has been stable on the floor.  At the time of discharge
we are continuing to hold his home Avapro, but this may be
restarted by his PCP as needed.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5 per
recent records but has had intermittent acute on chronic
disease, thought due to prograf toxicity. Peak creatinine was
5.6, which trended downwards and hit baseline of 1.5 on 2010-06-12 00:00:00.
ARF was thought to be secondary to ATN vs prerenal azotemia from
septic shock with poor perfusion. He was anuric, then
subsequently began to autodiurese. At the time of discharge his
renal function is normal and we have restarted lasix at 1/4 of
his home dose (prior home dose 80mg po qday). This may require
uptitration as an outpatient as needed.
.
# acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient was admitted with a
history of diastolic CHF and an EF of 65%. He was on lasix at
home.  During his admission he was noted to have an EF of 40% on
echocardiogram with global hypokinesis in the setting of his
SIRS. At the time of his discharge we have restarted lasix, but
at only 20mg qday (less than his prior dose). This may need to
be uptitrated in the future, but he is currently euvolemic on
this dose. We anticipate that his EF may recover as the patient
recovers overall and repeat echo may be considered in the
future.

# Rash: A maculopapular rash appeared on the patient's feet
2010-06-12 00:00:00. Only new medications at that time were lasix IV and
chlorthiazide so these were discontinued (lasix PO is a home
medication). The rash then resolved over the next three days. It
was believed to be a drug rash, albeit an unusual location.
.
# Diarrhea: the patient's diarrhea on this admission was ruled
out for c diff x 3. It began to abate after cessation of
antibiotics and was felt to be antibiotic associated diarrhea.
.
# Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Likely bone marrow suppression in the
setting of sepsis versus side effect of CellCept. Once coumadin
was restarted, the patient's stool became guaiac positive and
required 2 units total of pRBC's (given on different days) to
maintain Hct > 21. His hematocrit was subsequently stable and he
has no sign of active bleeding. He was Hit Ab negative.
Thrombocytopenia was stable.
.
# DM2: Blood sugars were initially poorly controlled in the
setting of sepsis and suspected PNA. He improved on an insulin
gtt was then resumed on his home lantus and an insulin sliding
scale with good control. The patient began to have FS in hte
60s-70s and stated that although he is prescribed 40 units
lantus qam and qpm, he often takes only 20. We decreased his
dose to lantus 20units qam and 20 qpm. FS should be followed
with likely uptitrating of his lantus dose at rehab as needed.
.
# Atrial flutter: The patient remained rate controlled. Coumadin
was held on admission due to supratherapeutic INR. He was given
vitamin K. Coumadin was  restarted on callout to the floor from
the ICU, however his INR was elevated after 5mg dosing.  His
coumadin is now being held for drifting down of INR and should
be restarted at 1mg po qday once his INR is <2.5.  His goal INR
is 2010-06-12 00:00:00 and this should be checked in three days and eevery three
days until stable.
.
# HTN: Initially, anti-hypertensives were held given septic
shock. Once hemodynamically stable, his metoprolol was restarted
at half of his home dose, with plan to titrate up as tolerated.
Diovan was held in the setting of renal failure nad should be
restarted as needed as an outpatient by his PCP.
.
# Hepatitis C: No active issues.
.
# Hepatitis B: Core Ab + in transplanted kidney.  Continued
lamivudine, which was initially dosed for renal failure and now
with improved creatinine is at regular dose.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: No active issues.  Continued simvastatin. At
the time of discharge we are holding his niacin, but this may be
restarted by his PCP after discharge as needed.
.
#ACCESS: Right IJ was placed on 2010-06-12 00:00:00 and pulled on the day of
discharge, the patient has a Left AV fistula.
