being found down on bathroom floor.  The patient has no

ampules of D50 at the scene.  The patient had a further
episode of coffee ground emesis in the ambulance.  At
arrival at UPMCE the patient's fasting blood
sugars was 59.  His hematocrit was 42.9.  Although the
patient was confused regarding the details of the event, the
patient did note that he felt better after receiving the
glucose.  He was transferred to UPMCE for a MICU admission.

Upon further questioning the patient states that he has noted
increased abdominal girth over the last one to two days and
ten minutes of sharp right sided chest pain on the day prior
to admission.  The patient states that he felt the pain was
most likely secondary to muscle strain and denies any
association with shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea,
vomiting or diaphoresis.  The patient has been taking his
insulin as per his routine with his last dose being the night
prior to admission.  The patient has not been compliant with

yellowing of the patient's eyes as well as decreased po
intake on the day prior to admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 61 year-old man with known
esophageal varices and liver failure presents with coffee
ground emesis.  The patient was admitted to the medical
Intensive Care Unit for management of presumed upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  His Intensive Care Unit course is as
described below.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  During the course of his
Intensive Care Unit stay the patient exhibited no evidence of
active bleeding.  His hematocrit was 35 on admission and
remained stable with a nadir of 32.2.  The patient had
esophogastroduodenoscopy done, which indicated grade one
(minor) esophageal varices and portal gastropathy.  No
additional banding was indicated.  At the time of transfer to
the floor unit, the patient denied any symptoms of
hematemesis, fatigue or lightheadedness.

2.  Hypoglycemia:  The patient was hypoglycemic at the time
of his episode and when transferred to the UPMCE
as described above.  Per the patient's wife report the
patient's diet was decreased on the days prior to admission.
The patient took his normal dose of insulin regardless.  The
patient was started on a dextrose drip with blood sugars
ranging less then 150 generally.  He was transitioned to an
insulin sliding scale and blood sugars have remained below
250 generally.  His outpatient insulin regimen was
discontinued until sugars were within normal limits.

3.  Increased abdominal girth:  The patient had been
noncompliant with diuretics for one week prior to admission.
After restarting diuretics abdominal girth decreased.

4.  Chest pain:  The patient described chest pain one day
prior to admission.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were
cycled and found to be negative.

Given the patient's stability in the MICU the patient was
transferred to the floor for continued monitoring.  His
course was as follows.

1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient had no further
episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding.  His hematocrit
remained stable.  He was hemodynamically stable.  He
continued beta blocker therapy for known varices.  He was
discharged to home on his outpatient medications.

2.  Hypoglycemia:  Once the patient was tolerating regular
diet, insulin therapy was reinitiated.  The patient had one
episode of hypoglycemia with a nadir of 47 on 2013-10-22 00:00:00.  The
patient has no history of prior hypoglycemic episodes despite
being on his outpatient regimen for over four months.
However, given the initial episode and inpatient episode of
hypoglycemia the patient's outpatient regimen was adjusted.
Per the medical attendings recommendation p.m. NPH dose was
decreased to 40 units and a.m. dose of regular insulin was
held.  Other then the described hypoglycemic episode the
patient's blood sugars remained in good control.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will continue his
outpatient medications.  The insulin doses were adjusted as
