than
50% mid disease.  The LCX had mild disease.  The Ramus had mild
disease.
The RCA had 60% mid lesion and an ostial 80% PDA lesion.
2. Left ventriculography demonstrated normal wall motion with
ejection
fraction of 60%.  There was no mitral regurgitation.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal system blood

pressure and normal LVEDP of 10 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
