Date of Birth: 1976-04-29 00:00:00 00:00:00     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Aortic regurgitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post stent
to left anterior descending.  Subsequent to this procedure,
patient developed aortic regurgitation.  He was evaluated by
Cardiology and he underwent a catheterization on 2010-04-29 00:00:00, which showed aortic regurgitation 4+, normal coronary
arteries with the stent being open, and a normal ejection
fraction of 45%.  The patient was then referred to Dr. Hytham Kelmer
for aortic valve replacement.

Patient denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, shortness of
breath or dyspnea on exertion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, IJ nephropathy, stent to left anterior descending,
hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a left calf
reconstruction.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zestril 10 mg po q.d., Atenolol 25
mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient has rare ETOH use and no tobacco
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's in no acute distress.
Temperature 98.6.  Pulse 65.  Blood pressure 160/73.  O2
saturation 98% on room air.  Patient has no carotid bruits,
no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Patient is
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen soft, nontender with normal abdominal bowel sounds.
Patient has no extremity edema.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.8,
hematocrit of 43.7, platelets 186,000.  Sodium of 137,
potassium 4.3, chloride of 99, bicarbonate of 27, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.0, INR of 1.1.

Stress test done on 2010-04-29 00:00:00 was significant for 8.5
minute Hytham Kelmer protocol, stopped secondary to 20 mmHg drop in
systolic blood pressure.  Asymptomatic with a ejection
fraction of 30-35%.

Cardiac catheterization significant for an ejection fraction
of 45%, hypokinetic wall motion, aortic regurgitation, which
is rated at 4+ with normal coronaries.

Electrocardiogram was significant for sinus rhythm with a
rate of 71 with left anterior fascicular block.  No ischemic
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient on the day of admission went to
the Operating Room where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a #27 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1477**] Jaylianna Boshell mechanical valve.  Patient
tolerated this procedure well and was transferred to  the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
Patient was extubated without incident.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable and was weaned off all drips.
Patient's hematocrit remained stable at 29.

On postoperative day number one, patient continued to remain
hemodynamically stable.  Patient continued to be weaned off
all drips.  Chest tubes were discontinued without incident.
The patient was started on his Coumadin for anticoagulation
for his mechanical valve.  Patient on postoperative day
number two was transferred to the floor.  Patient has
remained hemodynamically stable.  Patient's INR has risen
appropriately to latest INR being 1.9.  Patient has remained
afebrile.

On postoperative day number six, patient developed
tachycardia on the monitor.  Upon further evaluation, it was
found that patient has tachycardia with frequent atrial
premature contractions, but not to be in atrial fibrillation.
Patient's blood pressure remained stable.  Patient's
electrocardiogram demonstrated an elevated PR interval of 300
milliseconds.  Patient was continued on his beta-blockade and
was restarted on his ACE inhibitor. Patient will follow-up
with his primary care physician for electrocardiogram in one
week and to evaluate the PR interval at that time.  There
will be no further intervention done by the
Electrophysiologic Service at this time.

Patient has now been tolerating a regular diet and has been
ambulating at an activity level of 5 with Physical Therapy.
Patient is stable and ready for discharge to home.

1.  Aortic insufficiency, status post aortic valve
replacement #27 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1477**] Jaylianna Boshell valve.

UPMCE to be called into his primary care
physician, Boshell. Hytham Kelmer.  Patient to follow-up with Dr.
Boshell in four weeks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.
