Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
50F with hx of coronary vasospasm, HTN that presents from an OSH
after having suffered a cardiac arrest in the field, s/p CPR
with shock x1.

Of note the pt was admitted to the UPMCE service at UPMCE from
2007-06-26 00:00:00 after a month of increasing chest discomfort
concerning for coronary ischemia. While hospitalized, she had
dynamic ST depressions in V3-V6 during anginal episodes and
elevated trop to 0.16. At that time workup included both cardiac
cath (X2) and CT of the coronary arteries. Cath suggested
isolated bilateral coronary ostial stenosis. CTA was without
evidence of atherosclerosis. At the time it was thought the pt
suffered from cardiac vasospasm and not CAD. The pt was placed
on diltiazem, Imdur, and amlodipine. The pt followed up in
cardiology clinic 2007-06-26 00:00:00 and at the time was feeling with only 2
lesss severe episodes of retrosternal chest pressure, 2007-06-26 00:00:00, that
occurred spontaneously without exertion, lasting 10 min with
complete resolution. The pt had been able to participate in
aerobic exercise, 45 minutes and endorsed 40lbs wt loss while on
Weight Watchers program. The pt was last seen by her PCP Bonillas
2007-06-26 00:00:00, Dr. Bonillas, at which time she was feeling well. At the
time she reported LE edema since initiating amlodipine.

This morning the pt was bringing her children to school. Family
notes that patient has had increased chest discomfort this week
and using nitroglycerin at work. Her daughter notes chest pain
this morning which resolved prior to taking her daughter to
school. EMS reports that arrived on scene with bystander CPR in
progress (approx 7:45). Arrest was confirmed. The pt was shocked
once. CPR was continued and on second analysis, no shock was
advised. At that time the pt was noted to move, Amiodarone 150mg
was loaded and subsequently transferred to an OSH.

On arrival to the OSH, (hx obtained by UPMCE Hospital ED
physician Latisia Verlin via phone), initial vitals 108/55 HR 147,
Wt 99.7kg. The pt was intubated (two attempts made). HR ranged
from 123 to 151, with SBPs 108/55 to 174/74. 140's to 150's.
Exam was notable for pt as unresponsive but was reaching for the
tube. She did not respond to commandy prior to being intubated
with Succinylcholine 150mg, Versed 4mg, Vecuronium 10mg and put
on a propofol gtt. No acute EKG changes. Wbc 20. ck/trop neg.
CXR/CT of chest shows large aspiration pneumonia CT Head/CT
C-spine unremarkable. The pt was given Ceftiaxone 1gm,
Clindamycin 600mg, Azithromycin 500mg. 18G. Small lac to back of
head- going to get some staples prior to transfer. Vitals prior
to transfer were HR 124 117/57.

In the CCU, the patient is intubated. When propofol is weaned
patient moves all extremities however does not respond to
commands or follow directions.

On review of systems, unable to be obtained from patient. Family
reports that she was in her usual state of health and went to
the beach this past weekend. Besides chest pain episodes noted
above no other symptoms were reported by the patient. Family
notes patient to be a non reporter.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 year old female with history of coronary vasospasm presents
following a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology.

# s/p Cardiac Arrest: Witnessed VF arrest in the field with
bystander CPR. EMS confirmed pulselessness and AED advised
shock. ECG here without concerning ECG changes for ischemia.
Given history of vasospasm may be secondary to vasospasm leading
to ischemia and subsequent VT/VF arrest. She was placed on
arctic cooling to protect cerebral function s/p cardiac arrest.
2007-06-26 00:00:00 showed normal structure and function.  EEG showed abnormal
temporal lobe epileptiform but otherwise normal.  She was
started on aspirin, amlodipine, isosorbide mononitrate, and
simvastatin. She was noted to have ST elevation in V2-V4 on
2007-06-26 00:00:00 during rewarming phase with subsequent VF arrest s/p 1
round of CPR and shock with ROSC - K returned at 2.7.  She was
following commands and thus decision was made not to reinitiate
cooling protocol.  She was started on IV nitro and diltiazem
drip which resolved the ST elevation in anteroseptal leads.
After extubation and improvement in her mental status, her
regimen was transitioned to nifedipine 60 mg po qdaily, imdur 60
mg po qdaily, verapamil ER 360 mg UPMCE. EP was consulted and felt
the presentation could be due to long QT syndrome. She underwent
ICD placement on 2007-06-26 00:00:00 - infectious prophylaxis was with
Vancomycin. CXR showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
.
# Neuroprotection s/p arrest: Interval between arrest and
initiation of cooling was 5 hours. On presentation with propofol
wean patient without purposeful movement. CT head negative from
OSH. Artic Sun therapeutic cooling protocol with goal core body
temperature 33 degrees x 18 hours. Patient sedated with fentanyl
and midazolam and eventually need paralysis with cisatracurium.
She was warmed per protocol and was oriented and following
commands appropriately within 48 hours.
.
# CORONARIES: Prior cardiac caths in 2007-06-26 00:00:00 x2 both suggestive of
coronary vasospasm without flow limiting lesions. Has been on
amlodipine 10mg, dilt 240mg, and imdur 30mg as outpatient. ECG
at OSH unchanged from baseline. Regimen was changed to above
(see #1).

# PUMP: No prior 2007-06-26 00:00:00 or LV gram in UPMCE system. Pt with hx of
HTN that was potentially thought to be white coat but unclear.
Govanni Bonillas showed normal function.

# RHYTHM: No prior hx of arrhythmias however likely VF/VT arrest
on presentation and subsequent episode of VF in ICU. Thought to
be 2007-06-26 00:00:00 coronary vasospasm. Long QT syndrome was also considered
and genetic testing will be pursued by EP and discussed and
followed up.

# Pulmonary Infiltrates: Pt with evidence of diffuse infiltrates
on OSH CXR and CT. Right upper load with air bronchograms
concerning for pneumonia, however bilateral pathcy infiltrates
concerning for early ARDS. Was placed on
CTX/Clindamycin/Azithromycin at OSH for suspected
CAP/Aspiration. Transitioned to IV unasyn and then IV nafcillin.
Nafcillin was changed to Augmentin on 2007-06-26 00:00:00 and again to Bactrim
on 2007-06-26 00:00:00. Patient discharged wtih 7 day course of Bactrim UPMCE.

# Cloudy Urine: Urine appears "dirty" when foley catheter
placed. Continued on IV unasyn. Urine cultures were negative. No
further antibiotic coverage needed and patient remained
asymptomatic.

#dizziness: Pt complained of dizziness consistent with vertigo.
Pt received meclizine with improvement in her symptoms. No
evidence of orthostasis. Pt was ambulating without difficulty
prior to discharge. Pt will follow up with PCP regarding these
symptoms.

#hypokalemia: Mild evidence of hypokalemia requiring po
potassium supplementation. Pt was discharged with oral potassium
supplementation and spironolactone were started to help maintain
a normal postassium level. Pt planned follow potassium level 2
days after discharge.

#lower extremity edema: 123 Any St. likely secondary to calcium channel
blocker use stable from admission.

She was kept on subQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis. She remained
full code. Communication was with her husband.

Facility:
UPMCE

Discharge Diagnosis:
Coronary Vasospasm
Ventricular fibrillation


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You had more spasm in your coronary arteries and had a
ventricular fibrillation arrest. You were brought to UPMCE
hospital initially and then transferred to UPMCE for care. You
underwent an arctic sun cooling protocol and have recovered well
from the episode. There may be some correlation with a prolonged
QT and hypokalemia as well. Your telemetry shows only short runs
of VT (3-4 beats) that are rare. You had an ICD placed that will
shock you out of any prolonged runs of VT. Please call the EP
fellow on call if this happens. You had a staph pneumonia that
is being treated with antibiotics.
.
We made the following changes in your medicines:
1. STOP taking aspirin, norvasc, diltiazem and zocor.
2. START taking Verapamil to prevent coronary vasospasm
3. START taking Nifedipine to prevent coronary vasospasm, please
take this at night
4. Increase the Imdur to 60 mg daily
5. Start taking spironolactone to increase your potassium
6. STart taking potassium supplements to keep your potassium up
7. Take meclizine as needed to prevent dizziness.
8. Take Bactrim twice daily for one week to treat the pneumonia
9. Take acetaminophen as needed for ICD pain.
