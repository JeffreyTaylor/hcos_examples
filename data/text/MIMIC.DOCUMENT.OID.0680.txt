History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 year old woman with history of PAF,
hypertension who presents with shortness of breath. The patient
has had some sob and cough since 2014-12-22 00:00:00, when she was admitted
to St E with chest pain (sharp, substernal, pleuritic,
non-positional), shortness of breath and fatigue found to be in
new afib and started on coumadin. At that time an ETT was
negative and she completed a r/o MI. She was hypoxic at that
time requiring 4-6L of nasal cannula. On 2014-12-22 00:00:00 she had a CTA
chest that showed small bilateral pleural effusions and
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis w/o evidence for PE. On 2014-12-22 00:00:00
she had a tte ef>70% and trivial pericardial effusion. She
subsequently saw her cardiologist (at UPMCE) who stopped
coumadin as has converted to sinus. She saw her PCP Devers 2014-12-22 00:00:00
cough, sob, abd pain CT abd -> bilat effusions, small pericard
effusion and started on levoflox. She represented to her PCP
with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue and was referred
to the ED. She is very mildly short of breath and her cough is
dry. She only gets mild chest pain with coughing.
.
ED COURSE: Initial vital signs were 100.4 75 88/54 24 96%4L. She
transiently dipped her blood pressure to 80s which responded
slowly but well to 2L IVF. She also received 1 dose of empiric
decadron for adrenal insufficiency. She had a CTA that was
negative for PE but showed pericardial and pleural effusions as
well as mediastinal fat stranding. A formal TTE was done as well
which showed no tamponade physiology. CT surgery was consulted
with regard to the fat stranding and recommended getting
cultures of the effusions if possible. She received ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.
.
ROS: weight stable, prior abdominal bloating is gone. no rash.
no joint pain, no muscle pain. her last colonoscopy was 1year
ago and was normal. never been on steroids. no tanning of skin.
chronically constipated but had black stools 3 days ago. had
been drinking very little for the past week.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus @70. nl axis and intervals. no ST-T changes. compared
to
CXR:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right.
2. Mild enlarged cardiac silouhette, with a slight globular
appearance.

CTA chest:
1. Moderate sized pericardial effusion with stranding in the
mediastinal and epicardial fat concerning for mediastinitis.
Given this finding, clinical correlation for infected
pericarditis is recommended. Given the early phase of imaging,
enhancement of the pericardium will not be detectable on this
study.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
with
associated compressive atelectasis.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
4. Right thyroid nodules and calcifications. Clinically
correlate.

TTE: 2014-12-22 00:00:00 - Normal left atrium size. No ASD. Right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Mildly
dilated aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but no aortic stenosis. No AR. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No MVP. Physiologic MR. Moderate
[2+] TR. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. Small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Pericardial
constriction cannot be excluded.

TTE 2014-12-22 00:00:00 - Overall LV systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is
abnormal septal motion. Small, echodense pericardial effusion.
The pericardium appears thickened. The echo findings are
suggestive but not diagnostic of effusive-constrictive process.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small echodense pericardial effusion without echo
signs of tamponade. Probable effusive-constrictive physiology.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MR (test@mail.com) or right
heart catheterization is recommended to investigate for
constrictive physiology.

TTE 2014-12-22 00:00:00 -  Pre-pericardial window:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. Simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. Aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No AR
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No MR
7. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
8. Small pericardial effusion measuring 1-1.2cm located
primarily along the inferior and inferior-lateral aspects of the
heart. The pericardium appears thickened. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
9. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left.
.
TTE Post-pericardial window:
1. Biventricular function is preserved.
2. The size of the pericardial effusion has decreased to 0.5 cm
along the inferior-lateral position.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions are no longer evident post-chest
tube placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. Ayerim Devers was admitted to the UPMCE on 2014-12-22 00:00:00 for further
management of her shortness of breath. An echocardiogram was
suggestive of a small pericardial effusion and pericardial
constriction could not be ruled out. A CTA was performed which
revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion with stranding in
the mediastinal and epicardial fat concerning for mediastinitis.
Given this finding, clinical correlation for infected
pericarditis was recommended. The cardiology service was
consulted who recommended a pericardial window. The cardiac
surgery service was consulted and on 2014-12-22 00:00:00 Mrs. Devers was taken
to the operating room where she underwent a pericardial window
with Dr. Duuana Whynott. Please see separate dictated operative note for
details. Pathology revealed organizing fibrinous pericarditis
with adjacent adipose tissue has a prominent perivascular
lymphocytic inflammation that is focally transmural (lymphocytic
vasculitis). The latter findings raise the possibility of the
spectrum of collagen vascular diseases. Viral and bacterial
cultures were negative except for an indeterminate past
cytomegalovirus. Postoperatively she developed rapid atrial
fibrillation for which digoxin and beta blocker were given. As
she remained in rapid atrial fibrillation, amiodarone was
started. Mrs. Devers continued to have symptoms of constrictive
pathology and an echocardiogram was performed which confirmed
continued constriction. She was taken back to the
catheterization lab where she was found to have single branch
vessel coronary artery disease and hemodynamics strongly
suggestive of constrictive physiology. Given these findings it
was elected to return to the operating room. On 2014-12-22 00:00:00, Mrs. Devers
was taken to the operating room where she underwent a sternotomy
with pericardiectomy. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. She later awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Diuresis was initiated. On 2014-12-22 00:00:00, Mrs. Devers was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
monitoring. Amiodarone was continued for atrial fibrillation.
Dr. Duuana Whynott of hearts
monitor on discharge. Physical therapy worked with her daily to
increase her strength and mobility. Subcutaneous heparin was
started as she was not as ambulatory as expected. Coumadin was
started for atrial fibrillation. Mrs. Devers continued to make
steady progress and was discharged to rehabilitation on 2014-12-22 00:00:00.
She will follow-up with Dr. Duuana Whynott, Dr. Devers and her primary
care physician as an outpatient. Dr. Devers will manage her
coumadin dosing once she is discharged from rehabilitation for a
goal INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
