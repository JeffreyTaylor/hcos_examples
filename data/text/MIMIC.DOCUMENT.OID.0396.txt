Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Leoba Bussian
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2.


History of Present Illness:
60 year-old male with history significant for severe nonischemic
hypertensive cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), ICD placement,diabetes who
presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting since the
morning of admission. The patient states he ate breakfast at 9
am, and approximately one hour later, the pain began and
continued to wax and wane throughout the day, often reaching
2005-07-07 00:00:00. The pain was described as bandlike across his abdomen,
without radiation to the back. No aggravating factors other than
eating. The pain was alleviated with Morphine in the ED. The
patient has never had this type of pain in the past. The patient
also complained of nausea and vomiting, nonbilious/nonbloody.
The patient denied diarrhea, melena or hematochezia. He denies
any recent changes in his medications, recent travel, recent
alcohol use, history of gallstones or symptoms of biliary colic.

.
In the ED, the patient received one liter NS, morphine, and a
dose of levofloxacin. The patient was admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU he was given NS at 150cc/hr. Antibiotics were not
continued. The biliary team saw the patient and recommended
ERCP. The procedure was deferred due to the patient's INR. The
patient's pain was improved on transfer.

Chawn Grochowski sign. There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder
wall edema. There is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary duct
dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 5 mm. There is no
right upper quadrant ascites. Partially visualized portion of
the pancreatic head and neck demonstrate no acute abnormality.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of cholecystitis.
2.  Prominent hepatic veins consistent with venous congestion.

ERCP  2005-07-07 00:00:00
Impression: A plastic stent placed in the pancreatic duct was
found in the major papilla.
Evidence of a 123 Any St.us incomplete sphincterotomy was noted in
the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A mild dilation was seen at the biliary tree.
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge at the
biliary tree.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year-old male with congestive heart failure (EF 20%), status
post ICD placement, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic
renal failure presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
for 24 hours prior to admission and found to have pancreatitis.

.
1. Pancreatitis: Elevated amylase/lipase consistent with
pancreatitis as the cause of the patient's abdominal pain. The
elevated alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin was suggestive of a
gallbladder etiology. There were no obvious gallstones seen on
ultrasound; ERCP showed abundant sludge, however. The pancreatic
duct was stented during the first ERCP but the common bile duct
was unable to be cannulated; this was achieved with the second
ERCP. During the second ERCP it was noted that the stent
initially placed in the pancreatic duct had migrated and this
was subsequently removed. Amiodarone is known to rarely cause
pancreatitis; the patient's amiodarone was held and was not
restarted on discharge. The patient remained afebrile, without
leukocytosis, and with normal lactate. Antibiotics were
therefore not indicated. The patient was initially maintained
NPO with intravenous hydration but tolerated clear liquids and
then a regular diet soon after the second ERCP. The patient's
pancreatic enzymes trended down quickly. The patient's coumadin
was held and the patient was transfused one unit fresh frozen
plasma prior to ERCP. Coumadin should be held for ten days
following ERCP and can be restarted 2005-07-07 00:00:00.
.
2. Elevated transaminases: The patient has a history of elevated
transaminases and recently had an appointment in liver clinic;
etiology remains unknown. Recent hepatitis panel negative. The
patient's acute transaminase elevation was likely due to
gallbladder sludge. The patient's amiodarone and statin were
held and were not restarted prior to discharge. The patient had
follow-up scheduled with Hepatology for further outpatient
work-up.
.
3. Cardiac:
a. Vessels: Clean coronary catheterization in 2005-07-07 00:00:00. The patient
had no EKG changes and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits
on this admission. The patient's statin was held in the setting
of elevated transaminases, although unlikely secondary to
statin.
b. Pump: Hypertensive non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. The
patient's lasix was initially held and he was hydrated with
intravenous fluids. The patient was subsequently hypervolemic
but diuresed well with lasix. The patient was euvolemic on
discharge. The patient was continued on coreg. Diovan was
initially held for concern for acute renal failure but was
restarted when the creatinine was confirmed to be at baseline.
c. Rhythm: Chronic atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with
digoxin and coreg. The patient's digoxin level was within normal
limits on admission and digoxin was continued. The patient was
continued on coreg. Diovan was initially held for concern for
acute renal failure but was restarted when the creatinine was
confirmed to be at baseline. Coumadin should be held for ten
days following ERCP and can be restarted 2005-07-07 00:00:00.
.
4. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Insulin-dependent, moderate
control. The patient was given 1/2 dose of insulin 70/30 while
NPO but restarted on his home dose when taking a regular diet.
The patient was maintained on a humalog insulin sliding scale.
.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: Recent baseline 1.4-1.7; at
baseline. Likely secondary to diabetes and hypertension. Diovan
was initially held for concern for acute renal failure but was
restarted when the creatinine was confirmed to be at baseline.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia: Recent baseline 93-157. The patient's
platelet count remained stable during admission. Unknown
etiology. 2005-07-07 00:00:00 be due to liver disease. Further work-up deferred
to the outpatient setting.
.
7. Anemia: Recent baseline low-30s. The patient's hematocrit
remained stable during admission. Likely component of chronic
renal failure. Recent iron studies were within normal limits.
B12 and folate within normal limits on this admission. Further
work-up deferred to the outpatient setting.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized with pancreatitis. This was due to
gallstones occluding the pancreatic and common bile ducts. You
had two procedures to stent open the ducts responsible. You
should discuss follow-up with gastroenterology with your primary
care physician.
.
Please contact a physician if you experience fevers, chills,
chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, black stools or blood in your stools, or any
other concerning symptoms.
.
For your congestive heart failure:
Weigh yourself every morning, Chawn Grochowski MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet
Fluid Restriction: One liter per day
.
Please take your medications as prescribed.
- You should hold coumadin for ten days after your ERCP (until
2005-07-07 00:00:00).
- You should hold amiodarone and zocor until follow-up with your
primary care doctor.
.
Please keep your follow-up appointments as below.
