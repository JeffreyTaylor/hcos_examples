IMAGING STUDIES
CHEST XRAY ADMISSION 2008-05-12 00:00:00
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Sternotomy wires are midline and
intact.
Surgical clips are noted in the midline. The ET tube is above
the thoracic
inlet, approximately 7.5 cm above the expected location of the
carina.
Nasogastric tube is traced best up to the level of the mid
esophagus,
uncleAeryn Spivey traced thereafter. A tube-like structure within the
expected region of the stomach may represent the continuation of
the nasogastric tube, however uncertain. Bilateral low lung
volumes are noted with appearance suggestive of pulmonary
fibrosis.
.
CHEST XRAY 2008-05-12 00:00:00
Frontal view of the chest is compared to multiple prior
examinations. Right IJ catheter terminates in superior vena
cava. Remainder of lines and tubes are unchanged. There is
moderate congestive failure, small bilateral pleural effusions
and atelectasis at the right lung base. Heart and mediastinum
are stable.
.
CT SCAN 2008-05-12 00:00:00 FINAL REPORT
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse ground glass and nodular opacities with an appearance
most consistent with mycoplasma pneumonia. Extensive mediastinal
and hilar lymphadenopathy, likely reactive. Trace bilateral
pleural effusions.
2. Endotracheal tube ends approximately 1 cm above the carina.
.
CT SCAN WITH AND WIHTOUT CONTRAST 2008-05-12 00:00:00
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Intubation, with retained sinonasal secretions.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. Spivey is a 59yo M with history of severe COPD and pulmonary
hypertension who presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress
requiring intubation. He did well after extubation and was
discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation for further care.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: His respiratory distress was
likely related to extreme hypercarbia due to his underlying
COPD.  His COPD flare was likely due to medication noncompliance
in setting of running out of inhalers.  Chest CT showed diffuse
bronchopulmonary pneumonia concerning for a mycoplasma/atypical
process. He was started levofloxacin and will complete a 7 day
course on the night of discharge. He was started on solumedrol
and then switched to prednisone.  Extubated 2008-05-12 00:00:00 without
complication. He was continued on 60mg prednisone on transfer to
the floor.  A slow prednisone taper was initiated on discharge
to pulmonary rehab where additional titration of nebulizer
therapy will be continued and initation of home inhaler regimen
of advair and spiriva will be started.  His Bipap was continued
but at lower settings of 18/16, and his supplemental oxygen was
3L at discharge.  He was encouraged to stop smoking.  He will
have pulmonary follow up after discharge from pulmonary rehab.
.
# Hypotension: He is likely hypertensive at baseline given
lisinopril on med list but recent baseline is unknown.
Hypotension in MICU was possibly related to sedation surrounding
intubation or from decrease in right heart filling pressure with
positive pressure ventilation.  Normal lactate and lack of
leukocytosis are reassuring.  He was started on levophed in the
ED and this was weaned off as fluid boluses given.

# Tongue movement: His abnormal tongue movement in MICU was
concerning for possible fasciculation or seizure activity.  He
does not have a history of seizures and recent events leading to
hospitalization. These events did not continue and no further
work up pursued.
.
# Hypertension with Diastolic Dysfunction: 123 Any St.usly on
lisinopril and lasix - has not refilled Rx in two years.  He was
restarted on lisinopril and aspirin with a lower dose of lasix.
His blood pressure was well controlled and renal function
stable.  His peripheral edema slowly improved.  It is likely
that his lasix will need to be uptitrated in the outpatient
setting.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Disposition: Pulmonary Rehabilitation with close Pulmonary and
Cardiology follow-up
Mr. Spivey has not had medical follow-up in over 2 years and
medication compliance a significant issue in future management.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for managment of respiratory distress likely
caused by pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation.  You were intubated
for three days to assist with your breathing.  You were treated
with antibiotics for a pneumonia, and bronchodilator and steroid
therapy for management of your COPD.  You continued to improve.

While you were here, we restarted many of the medications that
were prescribed to you in the past.  It is very important that
you continue these medications and follow-up with your primary
care physician, Aeryn Spivey and pulmonologist as your
underyling pulmonary and cardiac issues have not been evaluated
in some time.  It is likely that some of these medications will
need to be changed or adjusted.

You are being discharged to a pulmonary rehabilitation center
prior to going home given the severity of your symptoms.  They
will prepare you for discharge to home.

We strongly encourage you to quit smoking as this is one of the
few things that will increase your life expectancy related to
your lung disease.

The following changes were made to your medication list:
1. START lisinopril 10mg daily
2. START lasix 20mg daily
3. START albuterol Nebulyzer therapy
4. START ipratropium Nebulyzer therapy
5. START Nicotine Patch
6. START Monteleukast
7. COMPLETE Prednisone taper as prescribed
8. CONTINUE aspirin and protonix as you have been taking
9. CONTINUE supplemental oxygen
10. CONTINUE BIPAP at night and while napping

Please talk to your PCP if you are having any problems with
obtaining these medications.

These medications may change upon discharge from Pulmonary
Rehab.
