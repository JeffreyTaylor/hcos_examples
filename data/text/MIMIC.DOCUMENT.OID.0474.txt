HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 72-year-old
male who is status post repair of a left inguinal hernia on
2011-07-08 00:00:00, who had been discharged home later in the day, who
had been feeling well until one day prior to admission when
he began to have fevers up to 101 and also had some chest
pressure.  He saw Dr. Malerba in the office, who was
concerned and sent the patient to the Emergency Room for
evaluation.  He denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any other symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.
2. Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Triamcinolone.
2. Lipitor.
3. Zestril.
4. Terazosin.
5. Allopurinol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke and he does not drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, he is afebrile with
vital signs stable.  He was in no apparent distress.  His
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart was
regular rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
Incision was clean, dry, and intact.

LABORATORIES:  His white count was 4.9, hematocrit of 43.7,
platelet count of 182.  Urinalysis was negative.
Chemistries:  Sodium was 134, potassium 3.9, chloride of 102,
bicarb of 26, BUN 18, creatinine of 1.3, blood sugar of 108,
CK of 72, troponin was less than 0.3.

He had a CTA to rule out pulmonary embolus which was negative
and a chest x-ray which showed no pneumonia and only some
mild atelectasis.

Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring and planned evaluation.  Upon admission to the
Emergency Room, he had a temperature spike to 104 with fevers
and chills.  He had blood cultures done at that time, which
ultimately grew nothing.  He was started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics, Vancomycin, gentamicin, and Flagyl and was
cultured.

On hospital day #2, he was changed to Vancomycin, levo, and
Flagyl, and he continued to improve.  His white count was
normal throughout his entire hospital admission.  His
temperature max on hospital day #2 was 104.5.  His primary
care doctor also saw him and suggested a lower extremity
ultrasound to rule out DVT which was done and was negative.

His platelet count began to drop on 2011-07-08 00:00:00.  His Heparin was
stopped and a HIT antibody was sent, which is pending at the
time of discharge.

.............. was consulted for evaluation of mastoids.  A
head CT scan was done on 2011-07-08 00:00:00 which showed fluid in his
left mastoid air cell.  It was felt that this was unlikely
cause of his fevers and is instructed to followup the ENT
Clinic if necessary.

Patient was transferred to the floor on 2011-07-08 00:00:00, and was
stable.  On hospital day #4, his temperature which had been
the highest at 104.5 was down to 100.4, and he continued to
do well.  He was allowed to eat a regular diet.  His platelet
count dropped again, and his Vancomycin was stopped.

On 2011-07-08 00:00:00, his platelet count and white blood cell count
had elevated after his Heparin was stopped.  His HIT was
still pending at that time, and the Vancomycin had been
stopped for a fear of his pancytopenia.

On hospital day #5, he was afebrile now for 72 hours and it
was felt safe that he could be discharged home.  He is
continued on levo/Flagyl for seven more days, and instructed
to followup with Dr. Malerba in 2011-07-08 00:00:00 weeks, as well as follow
up with his primary care physician.
