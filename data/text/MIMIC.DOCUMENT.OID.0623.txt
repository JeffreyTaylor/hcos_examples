PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (estimated LVEF 50%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility.

The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic
aortic dissection is seen. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
(2007-06-29 00:00:00+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Dr.Doane was notified in person of the results at time of
study.

POST-CPB:
A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position. The valve
appears well-seated with normal leaflet motion. There are no
paravalvular leaks. There is no apparent AI. The peak gradient
across the aortic valve is 38mmHg, the mean gradient is 22mmHg
with CO of 5L/min.

The patient is on low dose epi and norepi infusions. The LV
systolic function remains low normal, estimated EF=50%. The RV
systolic function remains normal.

The MR remains mild-to-moderate. Other valvular function is also
unchanged.

There is no evidence of aortic dissection.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pre-operatively, Mr. Doane had a low grade temp without
source. He was afebrile with a normal white count and was
brought to the Operating Room on 2007-06-29 00:00:00 where he underwent Redo
Sternotomy, AVR (23mm St.Analeiah Doane tissue)-see operative note for
details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. Intraop noted to
have pulmonary hypertension and postoperatively he had a
persistent metabolic acidosis. His pressure was labile and was
on levo and Epi. He was also mildly hypoxic and eventually
extubated without difficulty the following morning and was
alert, oriented and breathing comfortably. He weaned from all
pressors and inortopic support.  Beta blocker was initiated and
the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD #1 for
further recovery.  he contiued to have low Doane temps from
99.5-100.8 with a normal white count and all culture data
negative. While on the floor he remained hemodynamically stable.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  He failed his first voiding trial and foley was
replaced for urine retention. Patient has a history of BPH. He
underwent a second voiding trial and was unsuccessful - a foley
was replaced and he was discharged to home with a foley. He will
follow up with his primary urologist as an outpatient for repeat
voiding trial. mr. Doane did experience acute aggitation
and paranoia on POD#2007-06-29 00:00:00. he was given low dose haldol x 2 doses
and was finally able to sleep for the first time since hs
surgery. On POD#6 he was calm and cooperative without aggitation
or paranoia and his haldol was d/c'd. The patient was evaluated
by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #6 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
