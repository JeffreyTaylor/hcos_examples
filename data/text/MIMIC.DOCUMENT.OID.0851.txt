CXR:
2011-05-03 00:00:00 Stable overall volume to moderate to large air and
fluid
collections in the persistent right pleural space, despite
increase in
relative volume of fluid.
2011-05-03 00:00:00: Grossly stable to slightly larger right apical ptx,
s/p ct removal. increased right pleural effusion. Stable left
pleural effusion. Large subq emphysema. right pleural
thickening. post-op changes. no other change.
2011-05-03 00:00:00:  The right lower chest tube has been removed. The
upper chest tube is still in place. There continues to be a
moderate amount of right-sided subcutaneous emphysema.

lower lung, with extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right
chest wall and extending up right neck. Increased lucency of the
right lower lung may reflect compensatory hyperinflation of the
RLL rather than a basal pneumothorax. ET tube lies 7 cm from
carina. Gaseous distension of stomach.

Chest tube: posterior apical & basilar chest tube were to
suction initially and placed to water-seal with serosanguious
drainage. Airleak remained on suction POD 2, therefore
