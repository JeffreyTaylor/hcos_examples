EKG:
Baseline artifact. Regular rhythm with left anterior fascicular
block and right
bundle-branch block configuration, probably sinus rhythm. Since
the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2005-07-05 00:00:00 the QRS width is wider and R wave reversal in
the lateral
precordial leads is more marked, related to axis or lateral
myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Hematochezia/Crohn's: Likely 2005-07-05 00:00:00 combination of known Crohn's
and overanticoagulation most likely due to drug interaction of
coumadin w/ sasacol. Received 2Units FFP and 1 unit PRBC + vit
K. With drop of Hct as low as 23.6, 27.0 upon d/c.  INR upon d/c
1.0.  Underwent colonoscopy showing ulcer in proximal ascending
colon which wx bx to exclude ulcerated neoplasia, chrohn's dz
which was bx, and pseudopolyps in the descending colon and
sigmoid colon.
.
## ARF: likely hypovolemia in setting of GIB, Cr of 1.6 from
baseline of 1.0. Currently back to baseline.
.
## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: in sinus rhythm on 2005-07-05 00:00:00.
- hold anticoag for now as risks outweigh benefits.  Will be
restarted w/ f/u w/ PCP.  Fredda Bauza control meds because of bleeding,
pt not in AF on Bauza, [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart BB w/ d/c to rehab facility.


## HTN: Meds held in setting of bleed, restarting OP meds w/ d/c
to rehab.  Holding lasix 2005-07-05 00:00:00 to continued dehydration 2005-07-05 00:00:00 to
poor PO intake.
.
## DCM: appears euvolemic
- hold furosemide in setting of GI bleed
.
## h/o PE, LV thrombus:
- hold anticoag in setting of GI bleed, will restart as
outpatient.

Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
  You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission
for a lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Because of significant
blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with
transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins.  You
underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding.
It not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with
your Chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the
bowel.  Multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending.  The most
likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot
due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the
asacol which you started.  Both medications are being stopped,
and only restarted after discussion between your PCP and your
Gastroenterologist.
   After being evaluated by Physical Therapy, it is felt that
you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility
to help improve your strength after this hospitalization.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up w/ Dr. Fredda in 2005-07-05 00:00:00 weeks (test@mail.com
Follow up w/ Dr. Bauza in 2005-07-05 00:00:00 weeks (test@mail.com
