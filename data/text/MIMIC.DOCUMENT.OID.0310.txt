History of Present Illness:
78yo RH M h/o brain tumor s/p R frontal resection in 2005-04-16 00:00:00, CAD,
hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer s/p XRT and seizure disorder who
is transferred for increasing seizures.
.
He initially presented to OSH on 2005-04-16 00:00:00 with "symptoms of
left-sided hand weakness and clumsiness of 3 days duration",
worse from a baseline weakness on the left subsequent to tumor
resection. He also complained of slowly progressive
deterioration in his gait over several months, leaning to the
left.
.
He was admitted with seizures and found to have UTI and hypoxia
due to poor mucous clearance, all per his discharge summary.
Head CT was negative for acute stroke. MRI showed a
"cystic/encephalomalacic change in the right superior frontal
gyrus and left medial cerebellar hemisphere without evidence of
enhancement." MRA showed patent ant/post circulation. EEG seems
to have had right frontal seizure focus/slowing.
.
On 2005-04-16 00:00:00, he was "noted to have seizure activity" though this is
not further specified; depakote was found to be subtherapeutic
and the dose was increased. He was transferred to the OSH ICU
for further management.
.
He "continued to have intermittent episodes of seizure activity
with hypoxia". He was started empirically on zosyn for
aspiration pneumonia; UA was positive for UTI with pseudomonas.
The patient was tranferred here 2005-04-16 00:00:00 for further care and
intubated on arrival for respiratory distress. He has been off
of propofol since 2am.
.
On morning rounds at 9:25am, he was observed to have 30sec of
left hand shaking then his left face, with right gaze deviation
and eye opening/closure and no responsiveness. He was given
ativan 2mg IV x 1.

Admission CXR 2005-04-16 00:00:00:
There is no focal abnormality in the lungs to indicate
aspiration but
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm may reflect acute volume
loss from
aspirated material in the left lower lobe bronchus.  Followup is
recommended.  ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric
tube ends in the stomach.  No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette
.
Most recent CXR 2005-04-16 00:00:00:
Ill-defined right infrahilar opacity persists with no new focal
infiltrates or evidence of pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal
silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are within
normal limits.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube
terminates in the stomach and linear opacity projecting over
the right neck is likely external to the patient.
.
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged right infrahilar opacity, likely representing
aspiration pneumonia. No evidence of new infiltrates or
pulmonary edema
.
MRI Head:
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post remote craniotomy and
resection of a
small portion of the right frontal lobe with surrounding
gliosis.
Periventricular FLAIR hyperintensity likely represents a
combination of small vessel ischemic changes and chronic changes
from radiation.  No intracranial mass, hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, or evidence of abnormal enhancement
is identified.  Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is
slightly pronounced for patient's age.  There is no evidence of
acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
Opacification of multiple mastoid air cells is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:  Status post remote resection of a small portion of
the right
frontal lobe with no evidence of new mass or abnormal
enhancement
.
Admission EEG 2005-04-16 00:00:00:
ABNORMALITY #1: The right hemisphere revealed a 2005-04-16 00:00:00 Hz low
voltage slowing throughout the record.
ABNORMALITY #2: Over the left hemisphere, a 2005-04-16 00:00:00 Hz slow
posterior background rhythm was noted throughout the tracing.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to patient's mental
status.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Portable study precluded photic
stimulation.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from the waking to drowsy state,
but did not attain stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A generally regular rhythm was noted with an
average rate of 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the low voltage right
hemisphere delta slowing and the left hemisphere background
slowing. This suggests right hemisphere subcortical dysfunction.
The left hemisphere background slowing suggests a mild
encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, medication
effect, or toxic metabolic abnormalities
.
EEG telemetry 2005-04-16 00:00:00:
This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured five electrographic
seizures. Two appeared to have onset in the right temporal
region with subsequent spread to the left hemisphere and then
involvement of both hemispheres quite prominently and were
characterized by a gagging or coughing sound at onset followed
by left arm elevation and shaking. Three seizures appear to have
exclusively left temporal onset with subsequent spread to the
remainder of the left hemisphere and the right temporal region
prominently and were not characterized by any visible clinical
change on video. No interictal epileptiform discharges were
seen. The background was slow and disorganized throughout the
recording suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy
.
EEG telemetry 2005-04-16 00:00:00:
This 24-hour EEG telemetry captured six electrographic seizures
by automated detection. These all began with rhythmic sharp
changes in the right frontal region typically spreading to rapid
sharp alpha frequency activity of high amplitude in the left
temporal region and then rapid sharp high amplitude alpha
activity throughout much of the brain. Clinically, the patient
had gagging or coughing noises occasionally with additional
mouth movements or with elevation and clonic shaking of the left
arm. No interictal epileptiform discharges were seen. The
background was slow and disorganized throughout the recording
suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy
.
Most recent EEG, 2005-04-16 00:00:00:
This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations. There were no electrographic seizures or interictal
epilepiform discharges. The background was mostly slow and
disorganized in the theta frequency range throughout the day's
recording although some periods of alpha frequency activity were
seen on occasion. These findings suggest the presence of a mild
to moderate encephalopathy. Compared to the prior day's
recording, the encephalopathy appeared slightly improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
The patient was transferred from an OSH to the neuro-ICU. His
valproate level was found to be therapeutic initially and he was
seen to have left-sided focal seizures of his arm/face (thought
to be due to R frontal tumor resection). He was therefore
started on keppra 1000mg IV q12 in addition to Depakote 750 UPMCE.
Valproate dose was subsequently increased up to 1000 mg Q8 as it
was found to be low and the patient had continued seizures
(~1/day). Continuous EEG monitoring showed electrographic
seizures with R temporal onset (see full EEG report above).
After initiation of Keppra and up-titration of Depakote seizures
slowed and then stopped on telemetry.  He was extubated without
incident.  He finished a course of Zosyn -> Ceftazadime for
aspiration PNA.  Pt. was transferred to the floor for further
care.

Floor Course:
MRI Head was performed (see results above) and showed the remote
resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with no
evidence of new mass or abnormal enhancement or infarct.  This
was felt to be the focus for his seizures.  He had no further
seizures on the floor.  ASA 325 and Zocor were continued and we
resumed atenolol 50 mg QD.  A1c and lipid panel were checked
(see results above) and were at goal.  Blood, urine, and blood
cultures were negative throughout his course.  Pt. was afebrile
throughout his floor course.  He had some episodes of
desaturation, but given that he was afebrile and CXR findings
were stable, these were felt to be due to mucous plugging.  He
should continue to receive chest PT and frequent suctioning at
rehab.  Depakote level was checked and was subtherapeutic at 48,
so Depakote was increased to 1250 TID.  It should be rechecked
on 2005-04-16 00:00:00 and titrated as needed for goal 80-100.  Nutrition was
maintained with tube feeds throughout his course.  Pt. initially
was encephalopathic and inattentive on the floor, which was felt
to be contributing to his inability to swallow on swallow
evaluations.  Given that he did not have any further seizures,
we therefore decided to wean off his Keppra.  His inattention
improved with this intervention.  A decision was made not to
proceed with PEG for long term nutrition given that there was
some chance that his swallowing would continue to improve as
Keppra came out of his system.  He should be followed by speech
therapy at rehab, and if he continues to fail swallow evals PEG
may need to be considered.
