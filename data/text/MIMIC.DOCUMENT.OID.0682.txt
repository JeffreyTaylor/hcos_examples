Chest Pain

Cardiac Catheterization with 3 BMS placed in RCA


History of Present Illness:
Mr Kamerer is a 62 year-old man with past medical history of
HIV/AIDS, hyperlipidemia, former heavy tobacco use, and prostate
cancer s/p brachytherapy, who was transferred from UPMCE for STEMI. He reports three hours of substernal chest
pain that awoke him from sleep, with associated diaphoresis. At
UPMCE, EKG showed inferior ST-elevations, new from prior in
that system from 2009-07-17 00:00:00.  He was subsequently transferred to UPMCE
for management of his STEMI.
.
In the cath lab he underwent a Right radial approach. Found
proximal RCA occlusion. Passed wire and baloon inflation with
vagal response requireing 1 dose of atrompine and transient hear
block. Venous sheath placed but no transveous pacer placed. BP's
hung around 100's and response to IVF. Placed 3 BMS in RCA from
proximal to distal. Large vessel. Did not have complete
resolution of STE with some residual 2009-07-17 00:00:00 CP that is steadily
improviong. Has ASA, and PLavix on board and integrillin x18
hours. Will leave venous sheath in for access. Otherwise stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the cath lab he underwent a Right radial approach. Found
proximal RCA occlusion. Passed wire and baloon inflation with
vagal response requireing 1 dose of atrompine and transient hear
block. Venous sheath placed but no transveous pacer placed. BP's
hung around 100's and response to IVF. Placed 3 BMS in RCA from
proximal to distal. Large vessel. Did not have complete
resolution of STE with some residual 2009-07-17 00:00:00 CP that is steadily
improviong. Has ASA, and PLavix on board and integrillin x18
hours. Will leave venous sheath in for access. Otherwise stable.

After patient received 3 BMS to RCA, he had an uneventful
hospital course. He remained hemodynamically stable. ST
elevations on his ECG began to resolve. He was successfullty
started on ASA 325mg, atorvastatin 80mg, Plavix 75mg, Metoprolol
12.5 Daily and Lisinopril 2.5. Integrellin was d/c'ed

Patient had echo done after cardiac catheterization, which
revealed:

"The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior wall
akinesis with focal posterior wall dyskinesis. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion."

Patient complained of no CP on discharge. PT evaluated the
patient. He was able to walk briskly with no CP or SOB.

While hospitalized, the patient's doxazosin and methy123 Any St.ate
were held. He was instructed to hold these medications upon
discharge.

Patient was contactKanesha Kamerer after discharge and a message was left on
his cell phone. He was informed that Outpatient Cardiology (test@mail.com will be contacting him with an appointment in the next
1-2 weeks.

During hospitalization, the patient's HIV medications were given
at his normal home doses.

As a follow-up, the patient will need a repeat echocardiogram to
assess interval improvement of LV and RV function.

His heart failure meds can be titrated up as tolerated and
consider adding spironolactone to his regimen.
