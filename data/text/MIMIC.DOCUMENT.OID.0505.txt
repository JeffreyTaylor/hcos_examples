CXR 2011-09-17 00:00:00: Tracheostomy tube is in standard position with no
evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Patchy and linear
opacities in the
retrocardiac regions bilaterally likely reflect atelectasis but
aspiration is an additional consideration. Mild gastric
distension has developed.

ECG 2011-09-17 00:00:00: Sinus tachycardia. Wandering atrial pacemaker.
Biatrial abnormality. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of
2011-09-17 00:00:00 there is biatrial abnormality and the rate has
increased. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

DIAGNOSIS:

Tracheal window:
     - Dense fibroconnective tissue and ossified cartilage; no

     - Benign thyroid tissue.

Clinical:  Airway obstruction.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's
name, "Poe, Adrianjames" and the medical record number and
"tracheal window." It consists of two fragments of pink-tan soft
tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. The specimen

2011-09-17 00:00:00 pt transferred to floor from ICU

2011-09-17 00:00:00 pt had speech and swallow consult which showed he can have
meds, thin liquids and soft solids PO, pt encouraged to self
suction, spoke to daughter who would like pt to go to rehab

2011-09-17 00:00:00 pt had trach cuff taken down, and PT consult as well as
rehab screen to UPMCE, PT sts he is completely independent
and speech and swallow states he is low aspiration risk with
cuff down.

2011-09-17 00:00:00 video swallow study showed that patient is without
aspiration risk with cuff deflated for thin liquids and soft
solids, rejected by rehab, being screened for UPMCE
