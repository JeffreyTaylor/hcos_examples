HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old
male, status post motor vehicle accident. The patient was a
restrained driver involved in a moderate speed motor vehicle
accident with prolonged extrication. Loss of consciousness
was reported. The patient is currently complaining of left
shoulder pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Adderall.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 88, blood
pressure 130/83, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 100
percent on two liters. The patient is in no acute distress
with a GCS of 15. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
The patient has a superficial left ear laceration and lip
laceration. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and
S2. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is
soft, nondistended, slightly tender in the left lower
quadrant with no guarding. Rectal examination is heme
negative with normal tone. Back is nontender with no
deformities. Extremities show no deformities, two plus
dorsalis pedis pulses are palpated.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 43.4, normal chemistries, normal
coagulation, amylase 35, negative blood toxin screen, urine
toxin screen positive for amphetamines, lactate 2.3,
urinalysis with moderate blood. Films performed include a
chest x-ray, which showed a widened mediastinum. Pelvis x-ray
was negative. Head CT was negative. Neck CT was negative.
Chest CT showed a lingula contusion and a single rib
fracture. Abdomen and pelvic CT showed a small s123 Any St.
laceration. Left shoulder film was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit at this time for close observation secondary to his
s123 Any St. laceration. Serial hematocrit studies were performed
showing a persistently stable hematocrit and ruling out
enlargement in the s123 Any St. laceration. The patient was also
at that time placed on bed rest to prevent enlargement of his
s123 Any St. laceration. Due to the apparent stability of his
s123 Any St. laceration, the patient was transferred to the floor
on hospital day two. On postoperative day three, the patient
was restarted on oral nutrition, which he tolerated well.
Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to ensure that the
patient did not have any residual deficits. He passed
physical therapy with flying colors. Over the course of the
patient's stay, however, the patient became thrombocytopenic.
The question arose if the patient had developed heparin
sensitive antibody to platelets. A heparin panel was sent,
which was negative. The patient's platelet count did
stabilize. Due to his otherwise relative stability, the
patient was discharged on 2010-05-17 00:00:00 in stable condition to
follow-up in the Trauma Clinic in approximately two weeks. He
has been told he can resume normal activity, resume a normal
diet and resume home medications. He is being sent home with
Percocet for pain.
