Attending:Jazalyn Kizner
Chief Complaint:
Found unresponsive by friends.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Ventriculostomy
Lumbar punctures

History of Present Illness:
41 year-old female with a PMHx significant for major depression
and migraine headaches, transferred from Mt. UPMCE Hospital
where she was brought after being found unresponsive by her
friends.

Per report, Ms. Buckalew was diagnosed with otitis media in the
week prior to admission and treated with Z-pac and cortisporin
ear drops. 2 days PTA, she complained of a severe headache,
"possibly worst ever", accompanied by vomiting and fatigue. No
one saw her in the following 2 days. On the day of admission,
she was found unresponsive in her house on a couch, with "hoarse
breathing". EMS were called and Ms. Buckalew was taken to UPMCE, where she was electively intubated for airway
protection. She was given fentanyl, Mannitol, NS X 1 liter, and
etomidate. A tox screen at the OSH was positive for BDZ and
opioids (on amphetamines and a sleeping pill at home, and
possibly received opioids prior to intubation and tox screen).
Her exam raised concern for increased ICP with extensor
posturing and lack of corneal relexes. A CT head was remarkable
for foci of parenchymal hemorrhage, and she was transferred to
UPMCE for further evaluation and consideration for neurosurgery.

2008-12-16 00:00:00 CT HEAD: At least three punctate foci of parenchymal
hemorrhage are identified, one within the left frontal
subcortical white matter, the second within the right inferior
temporal lobe, and the third in the high right posterior
parietal lobe. There is no ap123 Any St.ble mass effect. There is no
shift of the normally midline structures. Ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and configuration. Basal cisterns remain
patent. There is a large area of hypodensity in the right
cerebellum. No abnormally enhancing lesions are identified
following the administration of contrast. The osseous structures
appear grossly normal. Note is made of fluid within the right
mastoid air cells and middle ear, a finding concerning for
mastoiditis in light of reports of patient right ear pain. No
underlying abscess is identified on the post- contrast images.
There is aerosolized fluid within the ethmoid air cells, likely
relating to intubation.

IMPRESSION
1. At least three tiny foci of parenchymal hemorrhage as above.
2. Findings consistent with mastoiditis in a patient with an
elevated white
blood cell count and ear pain.
3. No evidence of intracranial abscess.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient's ICU  course will be reviewed by problems.

1. Meningitis: The initial LP on 2008-12-16 00:00:00 was remarkable for an
opening pressure of 32, and CSF fluid with diplococci (later
identified as Streptococcus pneumonia). Given her recent otitis
media, ENT was consulted to rule out ongoing seeding +/-
mastoiditis. A bedside myringotomy was performed on 2008-12-16 00:00:00.
Subsequent imaging data and clinical examination ruled out
mastoiditis. Neurology and neurosurgery were also consulted on
admission. Ms. Buckalew was empirically started on Ceftriaxone 2
gm IV BID, Vancomycin 1 gm IV BID and Acyclovir. She was also
initially given Flagyl per ORL for anaerobic coverage.
Antibiotherapy was subsequently tailored given pansensitive
Strep pneumo (all subsequent CSF cultures sterile). Flagyl was
D/C'd on 2008-12-16 00:00:00, and Vanco and Acyclo were D/C'd on 2008-12-16 00:00:00. She
was continued on CTX (query allergy to PCN) with the plan to
complete a 14-day course. She was also started on IV decadron 10
mg Q 6H on admission, along with mannitol for management of high
ICP.

On 2008-12-16 00:00:00 and 2008-12-16 00:00:00, her clinical exam was suggestive of slow
neurological decline. Imaging studies (CT head and MRI) were
also consistent with increasing cerebral edema. Per neuro, daily
LPs were performed, both diagnostic and therapeutic, with
results as follows: 2008-12-16 00:00:00: OP 38, Closing pressure 23; 2008-12-16 00:00:00 OP
25/ CP 17, removed 20cc; 2008-12-16 00:00:00: OP 25, CP 13, removed 25 cc.

On 2008-12-16 00:00:00, the patient was noted to have a new downward and
adducted left eye, prompting a repeat CT head which showed
stable punctate hemorrhages, increased white matter edema, mass
effect on the lateral 3rd ventricle, extensive bilateral
watershed infarcts, acute infarct in the left thalamus, and
query uncal herniation. Neurosurgery was called and a
ventriculostomy drain was placed at the bedside. Insertion was
notable for a normal opening pressure, an ominous sign
suggesting that the edema was of parenchymal origin. Her ICP
remained low over the next 24 hours, and decision was made to
remove the EVD. She was subsequently weaned off Mannitol and
Dexamethasone.

On 2008-12-16 00:00:00, an EEG was performed to rule out seizure activity
given new ocular bobbing on exam. Per neuro, the patient was
also started on seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin.

From 2008-12-16 00:00:00 onward, serial neurological exams revealed no
meaningful recovery. Her brainstem reflexes, however, were
intact throughout. Serial CTs also revealed stable edema and
hemorrhages. Per the family's wishes, given the lack of
meaningful recovery despite adequate therapy, decision was made
to withdraw care on 2008-12-16 00:00:00.

2. Respiratory: Ms. Buckalew was intubated at the OSH for airway
protection. She was kept intubated until com123 Any St.n of the
antibiotic course. Serial ABGs were consistent with respiratory
alkalosis. She was extubated on 2008-12-16 00:00:00 per family's wishes,
and expired shortly thereafter.

3. Elevated amylase and lipase: In the ICU, rising amylase and
lipase were noted, the etiology of which was unclear. A RUQ U/S
revealed mild edema without obstruction/gallstone. Our suspicion
was low for acalculous cholecystitis. A medication list review
could not identify a clear culprit. A literature review revealed
possible pancreatic enzyme elevation in the setting of
intracranial hemorrhage. Enzymes trended down with IVF, and NPO
status.

4. Rash: A new rash was noted on 2008-12-16 00:00:00, erythematous, with
papules and comedones over the anterior chest, non-dermatomal,
and expanding. Dermatology was consulted. The rash was
consistent with steroid acne, which was not treated.

5. Communication: Her parents travelled here from 123 Any St. on 2008-12-16 00:00:00.
The family was kept abreast of developments. The plan was for
continued aggressive care until com123 Any St.n of 14 days of
antibiotherapy, and then reassessment of direction of care.
Given the  lack of meaningful recovery despite aggressive
therapy, a family meeting was held on 2008-12-16 00:00:00 with Dr. Buckalew,
neurology team, ICU team, and SW present. Per family's wishes,
the decision was taken to withdraw care on 2008-12-16 00:00:00. The NE
Organ Bank was called at the family's request, and procedures
were initiated for potential organ donation should the patient
expire rapidly after extubation.

The patient was extubated on 2008-12-16 00:00:00. All medications were
withdrawn and comfort measures were instituted. She past away on
2008-12-16 00:00:00 at night, >4 hours after extubation.
