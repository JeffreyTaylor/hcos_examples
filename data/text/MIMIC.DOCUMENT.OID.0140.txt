Embolectomy 2005-07-31 00:00:00


History of Present Illness:
Pt's a 82 yo F with h/o HTN, h/o of prox a-fib, (not on
coumadin), mood disorder on depakote (has had since CVA 4 yrs
prior), with prior L inferior division MCA infarct now
presenting with altered mental status.  Pt basically at baseline
AA0x2, has been reclusive living alone with mood disorder since
her stroke - but has family heavily involved in her care -
including ex-husband who visits daily.  Pt basically has been at
her baseline (which is described as more aggressive - usually
asking her family to leave within 10-15minutes of being around
her), but then 3-4 days ago noted being more lethargic - less
aggressive but without any other notable complaints per
ex-husband who saw pt then (no report of CP, F/C, HA, SOB as
best assessed).  Family getting concerned - were thinking would
be needing more higher level care placement as pt generally
weaker (no focal weaknesses) - but Sunday started appearing at
baseline again.  Pt was seen Monday early and was doing well
(has called ex-husband roughly around 2pm and noted again at her
baseline) - however when home aide came by apartment today in
the morning - pt did not respond to door - found lethargic with
emesis/stool/urine around her.  No further information able to
be obtained related to any events preceding to the evident n/v,
bowel/stool incontinance.
<br>

Pt denies any cp, ha symptoms - can not elaborate further - was
sent to ED - noted aggitated, +echolalia described in ED and
from home aide initially - all consistant per family with her
prior CVA 4 yrs prior.  CT head without sig changes - however
noted poor quality due to aggitation - neurology consulted.
Noted trop elevated 1.12 - cardiology called - stated will not
cath at present but for full medical treatment.  Pt had been put
in restraints in ED with foley placed - pt was subsequently
severely aggitated.  On arrival to floor - pt much calmer - not
in restraints - family at bedside.
<br>

In Jeremaine Gilboy pt treated with hep gtt, ASA/Plavix (though pt refused to
take), IV metoprolol (due to declining po meds), and vanc
1g/ceftriaxone 1g - for emperic treatment with leukocytosis (d/w
ED resident - they stated just emperic tx with leukocytosis -
were not aiming towards meningitis at time or any focal
infection).
<br>

ROS: pt unable to appropriately respond to full questions.

Past Medical History:
-HTN
-prox atrial fibrillation
-mood disorder - on depakote
-CVA 4yrs prior as above
frequent UTIs reported in past
anxiety
h/o HSV I around mouth, s/p valtrex
right cataract surgery

Social History:
lives alone, divorced, though ex-husband visits daily, 2
children, no tob/etoh/drugs. Russian speaking. Since stroke, pt
more reclusive with h/o of  mood disorder, but family very
involved with care - pt lives by herself - but gets assistance
from family for all IDLS, and for help with food preparation,
bathing - pt able to go to restroom and does take medications by
herself (as arranged in pill box by family).
<br>

Pt does not have officially assigned HCP - however 2 daughters
collectively have been making decisions on her care since her
stroke 4 yrs prior.

CXR:  IMPRESSION:
1. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, without evidence of
pulmonary edema and without change compared to 2005-07-31 00:00:00, suggesting
possible cardiomyopathy.
2. Slight increased, now moderate-sized hiatal hernia.

Non-contrast Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or obvious major acute area of
infarction.
If acute infarction is of clinical concern, MR has improved
sensitivity in comparison to non-contrast head CT.
Chronic infarct in left MCA distribution.
<br>
Cardiac Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall and
apex. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with LAD
infarction. Mild aortic regurgitation.

<br>
2005-07-31 00:00:00 CXR: The patient's radiograph currently demonstrates new
bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with interval
development of pulmonary edema. There are bilateral pleural
effusions also developed in the meantime interval, most likely
small to moderate. There is no pneumothorax and there is no
change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with h/o HTN, h/o of prox a-fib, (not on coumadin), mood
disorder on depakote (has had since CVA 4 yrs prior), with prior
L inferior division MCA infarct now presenting with altered
mental status with troponin elevation.
<br>
# AMS/NSTEMI: Patient began to have mental status changes 2005-07-31 00:00:00
days prior to admission, then was found on the floor with
emesis/stool/urine around her.  In ED,  had altered MS with new
inferolateral ST depressions and T-wave inversions in aVL on
ECG, elevated troponin and no acute changes on CT Head.
Neurology was consulted for possible metabolic encephalopathy,
either due to effect of medications (on depakote at home) or
infection (T to 100.4 and leucocytosis). Her family declined a
lumbar puncture.  ACS protocol was initiated with IV heparin and
betablockers, while patient refused PO medications.  The family
chose not to undergo catheterization, opting for more
conservative medical management.
The morning of 2005-07-31 00:00:00 the patient was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with decreased
urine output and new pulmonary edema on CXR.  Echocardiogram
that day showed akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum,
anterior wall and apex.  Diuresis was undertaken.  Then at 1700,
the patient's left hand was noted to become cold, blue and
painful.  Vascular surgery was consulted, the patient was
transferred to the CCU.  She was also started on a high dose
statin and a small dose of an ACE inhibitor. Neurology
recommended that she have a non-emergent MRI head to r/o embolic
stroke not visualized on head CT, however family declined as it
would not likely change management.
<br>
# Anticoagulation: Patient has multi123 Any St.dications for being
maintained on anticoagulation, and at the time of discharge, pt
is currently on a heparin drip while bridging to therapeutic
INR.  Considering thromboembolism to her arm requiring
embolectomy, her atrial fibrillation, and her history of strokes
in the past, I recommend overlapping her heparin drip with a
therapeutic INR x 48 hours.  Please note that at the time of
discharge, her INR measured 2, however this is likely
OVERestimated, as her PTT at the time was >150, and at that
level of anticoagulation can falsely elevate the INR.  I
recommend obtaining a repeat INR upon admission.  Please titrate
coumadin dosing prn for goal INR 2005-07-31 00:00:00.
<br>

# Left hand ischemia: Patient was noted 2005-07-31 00:00:00 to have a palpable
brachial pulse and absent radial pulse on the left side.  Most
probably cause was felt to be an arterial clot in the setting of
atrial fibrillation.  The patient had already been started on a
heparin drip for ACS and this was continued.  The vascular
surgery team was consulted regarding the limb ischemia and
embolectomy was felt to be indicated as she continued to have
cyanosis of her left hand despite being on the heparin drip.
She had a successful embolectomy on 2005-07-31 00:00:00 of the left brachial
artery under local anesthesia.  Her post-op course was
complicated by a large 8cm hematoma at the entry site in the
left arm, which was followed closely by vascular surgery, as no
urgent need for hematoma evacuation was indicated overnight.
Given a stable hematocrit, the patient was continued on IV
Heparin for anticoagulation for her recent NSTEMI as well as her
history of Afib.
<br>

# Atrial Fib - Patient has a history of paroxysmal a-fib, but
was not on coumadin due to a high risk of falls.  She was found
to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR the morning of 2005-07-31 00:00:00, but
since has been adequately rate controlled with metoprolol.
Given her recent embolic event to her left arm, she was started
on coumadin with a heparin bridge.   To avoid an excessive
bleeding risk, her Plavix was discontinued(patient was started
on aspirin and plavix after an MCA CVA apprx 3 years ago) and
her Aspirin dose was reduced to 81mg daily.
<br>

# Mood disorder: Patient has had behavioral problems since a CVA
three years ago.  After admission her mental status apparently
returned to baseline.  She was continued on home doses of
Depakote, Paxil and Zyprexa.  Restraints and foley catheter were
avoided.
<br>

# Pulmonary edema - patient was diuresed with IV Lasix.  She is
incontinent and did not have a foley catheter, making it
difficult to measure her fluid balance, but she appeared to be
euvolemic and breathing comfortably at the time of discharge.
<br>
# HTN - Patient was adequately controlled with metoprolol and
lisinopril.
<br>
Prophylaxis - patient maintained on famotidine and SQ heparin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with altered metntal status. You ruled in for
a heart attack but the decision was made to pursue conservative
management. Your heart went into a rapid rate and a blood clot
traveled to your left arm causeing a blockage. You were taken to
the OR for removal of the clot. You were put on a heparin drip
and will need to be on long term anticoagulation with coumadin
to prevent further blood clots. You were also noted to have low
B12 level which can contribute to altered mental status and you
being given b12 supplementation
