History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64 M with CAD s/p 4V-CABG 2011-02-19 00:00:00, AVR 2011-02-19 00:00:00 Abshir Mcintyre mechanical valve, HTN, AFIB, DM2, transferred from
UPMCE Hospital to UPMCE ICU for workup of acute GIB. Admitted
to 123 Any St. on 2011-02-19 00:00:00 considering replacing his mechanical with
porcine valve, but there he had CP and dizziness per GI consult
note there, but was found to have INR 5 and Hct 18. Over 2
weeks, he received 14 U RBC, Hct up to 30s but then drifted
down. Did capsule limited by food but possibly melena, EGD
negative, bleeding scan negative, found blood trickling down
from terminal ileum. Patient did not notice any blood, but blind

UPMCE for further evaluation and potential replacement of
metallic aortic valves with porcine valve that would not require
anti-coagulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 64 M with CAD s/p 4V-CABG 2011-02-19 00:00:00 and
drug-eluting stent to SVG in 2011-02-19 00:00:00, AVR 2011-02-19 00:00:00 Abshir Mcintyre
mechanical valve, HTN, AFIB, DM2, transferred from UPMCE
Hospital to UPMCE ICU for workup of acute GIB.
.
1. Acute Blood Loss anemia from GI bleed: The patient initially
presented to UPMCE Hospital with shortness of breath and chest
pain; he was found to have a marked anemia, bloody stools, and a
supratherapeutic INR.  He was transfused with pRBCs and
stabilized. Evaluation there pointed to a GI source but could
not localize a lesion. During his stay there his home regimen of
aspirin, Plavix, and coumadin was discontinued due to the risk
of exacerbating the GI bleed.  He arrived at UPMCE on a heparin
drip.  He was transferred to UPMCE for further evaluation. He
was first admitted to the Cardio-Thoracic surgery service for
consideration for replacing the metallic aortic valve with a
porcine valve that would not require anti-coagulation.  However,
given that he had already undergone a re-do sternotomy; it was
not felt safe to open the chest again. After several attempts at
localizing a lesion, small angioectasias were found in multiple
sections of the small bowel.  Also, mild gastritis was found.
However, no active bleeding was indentified.  Given the
dispersed location of the angioectasias included some very
distal lesions, an endoscopic therapeutic option was not
feasible.  His hematocrit was stabilized by the time of
discharge for ~2 weeks as the evaluation continued.  He will be
discharged on a PPI at twice daily dosing to complete 1 month
afterwhich he will decrease the dose to daily.  He will be
anti-coagulated with coumadin with INR target of 2.5-3.5.  His
INR and hematocrit should be closely monitored weekly for 1
month.  Strict attention should be made to maintain his INR in a
therapeutic range to decrease the likelihood of re-bleeding. His
anti-platelet agents were not restarted during this hospital
stay due to the risk of re-bleeding would likely outweigh the
risk of in-stent thombosis now 13 months since the placement of
the most recent stent. These medications could be re-considered
as an outpatient. His hematocrit at discharge was 28.9 and his
INR was 2.7.
.
2. AV replacement: The patient continued on anti-coagulation
with heparin drip monotherapy while the GI bleed evaluation
continued.  He was discharged with coumadin as above.
.
3. CAD, CHF - The patient has an extensive history of coronary
disease including a CABG in 2011-02-19 00:00:00 and subsequent
re-vascularizations.  Given his risk of life-threatening GI
bleeding his anti-platelet agents were discontinued.  He
remained chest pain free during his hospital stay.  He was
well-compensated from his CHF.  He remained on carvedilol with
adequate heart rate and blood pressure control. He remained on a
statin.  Aspirin and plavix were held as above. If his blood
pressure would tolerate it, he would be a good candidate for
adding Jaisley Merlina Mcintyre to his heart failure regimen.
.
4. Itch: The patient complained of intense itchiness of his
lateral forearms. In talking with the patient's wife this has
been a chronic problem for him and gets adequate control of the
symptoms with over-the-counter remedies.  The area of concern
was without ap123 Any St.ble skin changes or rash.  He was discharged
with anti-histamines and topical therapies for symptomatic
relief.  An evaluation by an allergist may be of benefit as an
outpatient.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitus type 2: The patient had variable blood
sugar control as his diet would vary with regard to procedures
done to evaluate the GI bleeding.  He was followed closely by
the Mcintyre Diabetes consult service to titrate his insulin
dosing.  He will be discharged with glargine insulin and humalog
sliding scale.
.
6. Chronic kidney disease - The patient has a baseline chronic
kidney disease likely related to diabetes, hypertension and
residual damage from IV contrast administration.  He remained
close to his baseline Cr throughout his hospital stay except for
a mild rise which was thought secondary to pre-renal azotemia
from inadequate oral intake.  His creatinine recovered to his
baseline with oral hydration.
.
7. Hypertension: The patient had stable blood pressure on home
blood pressure regimen.
.
8. AFIB: There were no acute issues. He remained well rate
controlled with his carvedilol. He was anti-coagulated as above.

.
9. Depression: There were no acute issues, and he remained on
his home regimen.
.
10. FEN: diabetic, cardiac diet
11. PPX: No bowel regimen needed, PPI, heparin gtt
12. CODE: Full
13. DISPO: The patient was discharged in good condition to
follow-up with his PCP and have his blood drawn periodically to
monitor his INR and hematocrit.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated for a gastro-intestinal bleed.  The
likely source(s) of the bleeding was (were) small abnormal blood
vessels in your small bowel. Several attempts were made to treat
the lesions directly, but these were beyond the reach of the
enteroscopes.  As the bleeding stopped, you were restarted on
your coumadin and discharged to home with close follow-up with
your primary doctor.
.
You should have your blood counts checked regularly as described
in the discharge medication section.  Also now that you are back
on the coumadin, you will need regular monitoring of the dose to
limit the risk of re-bleeding.
.
Please attend the recommended follow-up appointments as
described below.
.
Please take the medications as prescribed. Your medications have
changed since you originally entered the hospital.  Please take
only those medications listed in the discharge paperwork.
.
If you develop any new or concerning symptoms particularly any
signs of re-bleeding (bloody stools, dizziness, shortness of
breath, or chest pain); seek medical attention immediately by
calling 911. For at least a month, you should have your family
members look at your  stools to make sure there is no blood.

Followup Instructions:
1: Primary Care Physician: Mcintyre. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5802**] Mcintyre on Thursday, 2011-02-19 00:00:00 at 11am.  Please call test@mail.com with questions.
