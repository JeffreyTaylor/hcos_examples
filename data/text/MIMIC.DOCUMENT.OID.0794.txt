3days , worse past day with a dry cough. Symptoms started
abruptly on Sunday night with SOB while walking to bathroom. SOB
remaind persistent over the following days, with worsening DOE.
She initially presented to Daleshia Aly hospital and was found to
be hypotensive and was transferred to UPMCE ED with suggested
diagnosis of PNA, incidentally found to have elevated troponin
of 1.73.  She was started on heparain at OSH. Received azithro
and Ceftriaxone at OSH. Was on neo at 100 mcg. Got RIJ in our
ED. Crackles at bases, Febrile to 100.1. Gave levofloxacin. Put

have bilateral infiltrates. ECG here afib rate 123 Any St.
elevations V4-V6. Patient denies chest pain.
.
On review of systems (limited as pt poor insight), she denies
any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
but worsening dyspnea on exertion, she endorses unchanged
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and nocturia, orthopnea which is
unchanged, no ankle edema, no palpitations, no syncope or
presyncope.

2D ECHO 2008-08-10 00:00:00
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. The remaining basal segments
contract normally (LVEF = 20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic root and ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion.There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate (2008-08-10 00:00:00+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
biventricular cavity size and extensive systolic dysfunction c/w
diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.) At
least mild moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending
aorta.
.
CHEST XRAY 2008-08-10 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory right IJ line position.
2. Edeme-like pattern suggestive of volume overload/heart
failure. Repeat
radiography after diuresis recommended to assess for underlying
infection.
3. If necessary repeat PA/lateral could help better evaluate the
right lung base given the concern for pneumonia.
.
CARDIAC CATH 2008-08-10 00:00:00
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
diffuse calcific coronary artery disease. The LMCA was not
well-visualized.
The LAD was highly calcified, and had a 90% ostial lesion with
diffuse
disease throughout the mid-portion of 90%. The LCX was tortuous
and was
without any angiographically apparent disease. The RCA was
calcified
and had a 60% stenosis in the mid-portion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures with mean RA pressure of 21 mmHg and mean PCW pressure
of 33
mmHg.  The patient also had elevated pulmonary artery pressures
with
mean PA pressure of 42 mmHg and peak PA pressure of 71 mmHg.
Both mean
and peak PA pressures decreased during the case following
administration
of IV furosemide. The cardiac output, calculated from the Fick
equation,
was normal at 5.5 L/min.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel severe coronary artery disease not well suited
for PCI.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F hx CAD s/p atherectomy in '2008-08-10 00:00:00, HTN, HLD, paroxysmal
atrial fibrilliation (not anticoagulated), and morbid obesity
who presented subacutely with anterior STEMI and systolic
congestive heart failure.
.
# CORONARIES: Coronary cath on 2008-08-10 00:00:00 showed 90% mid-LAD disease
and 60% stenosis of mid-RCA but tortuous, calcific vessels that
were not amenable to intervention. Patient's anterior STEMI was
medically managed with aspirin 81 mg, Plavix 75 mg, Atorvastatin
80 mg, and metoprolol. She was started on 81 mg dose of aspirin
to minimize risk of hemorrhage secondary to triple anticoagulant
therapy. The patient's beta blocker was slowly titrated due to
episodes of hypotension, and she was discharged on metoprolol
succinate XL 50mg once daily with good blood pressure control.
TIMI risk score for STEMI was calculated to be 10, 123 Any St.ting
36% mortality at 30 days. The patient was discharged with
cardiology follow up as an outpatient for further management and
evaluation for an ICD.
.
# SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Initial presentation of patient was
concerning for cardiogenic shock, and the patient was briefly
treated with pressors to achieve a mean MAP of > 60%. A TEE on
2008-08-10 00:00:00 showed systolic heart failure w/ LVEF of 20-25%, dilated LA,
mild LVH, severe LV systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of
distal 2008-08-10 00:00:00 ventricle, no masses or thrombi, RV with focal
hypokinesis of apical free wall, and 2008-08-10 00:00:00+ MR. Clinically,
patient appeared to be volume overloaded with pulmonary edema
causing dyspnea and hypoxia. Diuresis was achieved with Lasix
20mg IV prn; total of >6L net fluid was removed throughout
hospital stay. Patient was discharged on lasix 20mg PO daily for
symptomatic relief of CHF. In addition, she was started on an
ACE inhibitor, and titrated up as blood pressure would allow; at
discharge, she was able to tolerate lisinopril 5 mg daily.
Spironolactone was not initiated due to low BP. Given the degree
of myocardial hypokinesis seen on echo, the patient was
anticoagulated to minimize risk of thrombus formation.  She was
initially started on Heparin ggt with bridge to coumadin.  On
the day of discharge, she was switched from heparin to
Fondaparinox, with a plan for daily Fondaparinox until INR > 2.
.
# ID: In the ED, the patient had a leukocytosis and low grade
fever and initially treated with levofloxacin for questionable
infiltrate versus pulmonary edema on CXR. However, given
evidence of STEMI and CHF with TTE showing severely decreased
EF, the patient's hypotension was felt to be more consistent
with cardiogenic shock rather than sepsis. The patient was
afebrile for remainder of hospitalization and white count
normalized. Blood cultures x2 were obtained which did not show
any growth at time of discharge. Urine culture was positive for
mixed flora, c/w contaminated specimen, and patient was treated
for UTI with a 2-day course of ciprofloxacin (completed 2008-08-10 00:00:00).
.
# HYPOXIA: Hypoxia was likely secondary to volume overload from
systolic heart failure. The patient required noninvasive oxygen
supplementation, and was gently weaned off O2 was she was
diuesed; O2 saturation was 94% on RA prior to discharge. She was
able to ambulate without becoming hypoxic or significantly
dyspneic, although she was noted to desat to the 80s while
sleeping at night. Due to nocturnal hypoxia and morbid obesity,
patient is strongly recommended to obtain a sleep study as
outpatient to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient was in atrial fibrillation on initial
presentation put converted to and maintained in sinus rhythm.
Patient was kept on telemetry. Rate control was achieved with
metoprolol which was titrated up as discussed above. As
discussed above, the patient was anticoagulated primarily for
prevention of apical thrombus and was bridged to coumadin
therapy with heparin ggt followed by Fondoparinox. At discharge,
she had INR of 1.9 and planned to continue daily Fondaparinox
until INR therapeutic at > 2.  She should have frequent INR
checks for Coumadin dosing monitoring.
.
# Hyperglycemia: The patient experienced mild hyperglycemia
while admitted, thought to be secondary to the stress of STEMI
and acute CHF, with a likely component of insulin-resistance.
Her glucose was well-controlled on an insulin sliding scale.
Hemoglobin A1C was 6.3.  Glucose control should be reassessed on
an outpatient basis.
.
# ASTHMA: Patient initially had wheezing secondary to CHF as
well as asthma that was improved significantly with ipratropium
nebulizaer q6h and PRN albuterol nebs.
.
# S/p recent cataract surgery: Home prescriptions of
prednisolone and Acular eye drops were continued.
.
# FEN: Patient was kept on cardiac diet.

# PROPHYLAXIS: DVT ppx with heparin gtt. Bowel regimen with
senna, colace, miralax.

Discharge Condition:
Stable. Vital signs stable.


Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and your heart is weaker than it was. You
were treated for acute congestive heart failure and will need to
take new medicines to help your heart pump better. We believe
that your heart function will improve as it recovers from the
heart attack. WE were unable to open the blockage in your artery
that led to the heart attack. You also had atrial fibrillation,
a common irregular heart rhythm. This rhythm increases your risk
of stroke so you were started on Warfarin (coumadin) to prevent
blood clots and stroke. You will need to be aware of medicines
that interact with Warfarin and that it might cause your to have
minor or more serious bleeding. Please refer to the information
packet we gave you regarding warfarin use. You will take
fondaparinox until your INR is >=2.0.
Weigh yourself every morning, Daleshia Aly MD if weight increases by > 3
