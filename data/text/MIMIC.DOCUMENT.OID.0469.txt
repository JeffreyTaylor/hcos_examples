History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 y/o female with past medical history of
hypothyroidism presenting initially for an urgent care visit
with an episode of  diaphoresis and presyncope several hours
prior.  The patient has had ~1 month of bilateral neck
discomfort associated with mild dyspnea on exertion.  Her neck
pain improved with physical therapy and her neck pain improved.
She now reports worsening DOE and worsening neck pain over the
past 1 1/2 weeks. She now has difficulty walking up a single
flight of stairs.  Additionally, she reports that for the past
few days, she hasn't been "feeling herself", with fatigue,
nausea, vomitting, decreased PO.  On day of presentation she was
leaving work, walking to car when had acute onset of diaphoresis
and presycnope associated with SOB; no fall /headstrike.  No
palpitations.  Presented to clinic for further evaluation.  In
clinic triage noted to be tachycardic to 116.  On review of
systems she reports low grade fevers (but has been taken
ibuprofen regularly), 5 pounds of weight loss over past 2 weeks,
day&nightime sweats (and felling 'hot'), with increasing
nausea/vomitting.  She has had no lymphadenopathy, abdominal
pain, change in her bowel or bladder habits, muscle or joint
pain. Of note, on review of history had recent TSH of .088 2012-09-30 00:00:00,
for which she had levoxyl dose decreased and cytomel dose kept
the same.

In the ED, initial vitals were  100.0 116 126/88 18 99% Labs and

PATHOLOGY

2012-09-30 00:00:00 pericardium, mediastinal mass biopsy

SPECIMEN #1:  PERICARDIUM, BIOPSY (A).
DIAGNOSIS:
CARDIAC MUSCLE AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE WITH FIBRIN DEPOSITION
AND GRANULATION TISSUE REACTION. THERE IS NO MORPHOLOGIC
EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY LYMPHOMA.

SPECIMEN #2:  SOFT TISSUE MASS, RIGHT ANTERIOR MEDIASTINUM,
BIOPSY (B-C).
DIAGNOSIS:
DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL (THYMIC)
TYPE, SEE NOTE.

SPECIMEN #3:  SOFT TISSUE MASS, RIGHT ANTERIOR MEDIASTINUM,
BIOPSY (D-E).
DIAGNOSIS:
DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL (THYMIC)
TYPE, SEE NOTE.

Note: H&E sections (B through E) reveal fibrous tissue with
abundant geographic necrosis and infiltration by an atypical
lymphoid population in an invasive and reticulated growth
pattern with delicate interstitial fibrosis.  The tumor cells
are large with moderately abundant amphophilic cytoplasm.  The
nuclei have pale chromatin, irregular and angulated nuclear
contours, and small inconspicuous nucleoli.  Scattered mitoses
and apoptotic bodies are seen.

By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells are pan reactive with CD45
and in addition, immunoreactive for CD20 and PAX-5, with
co-expression of CD30, MUM1, and BCL-6.  The admixed reactive
T-cells are positive for CD3 and CD5.  The tumor is negative for
CD10, CD15, and CD56, which shows only rare scattered positive
cells.  The tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin cocktail
(which stains the fibroblasts), synaptophysin, S-100, and TdT.
The proliferation index, by MIB-1 staining, is approximately
80-90%.  The combined clinical, morphologic, and
immunophenotypic findings are most consistent with the diagnosis
of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 3,5,10,19.20,23,45.
RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.  B cells comprise 1% of
lymphoid-gated events, (<1% of total events), and do not express
aberrant antigens.  T cells comprise 63% of lymphoid gated
events, 3% of total events, and express mature lineage antigens.

INTERPRETATION
Nonspecific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma are not
seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology (see S12-40728K) is recommended.  Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.

2012-09-30 00:00:00 Bone Marrow Biopsy
DIAGNOSIS:
HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE
HEMATOPOIESIS.  THERE IS NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT
BY LYMPHOMA.


MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral Blood Smear:
The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes are
decreased, with mild anisopoikilocytosis including occasional
echinocytes, and rare target cells.  The white blood cell count
is normal.  Occasional hypersegmented neutrophils are seen.  The
platelet count appears normal.  Occasional large platelets are
seen.   A manual differential shows:  97% neutrophils, 0% bands,
3% lymphocytes, 0% monocytes, 0% lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0%
basophils.


Aspirate Smear:
The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation.  M:E ratio is
1.5:1.   Erythroid precursors are relatively proportionately
decreased in number and exhibit overall normoblastic maturation
with rare cells with irregular contours.   Myeloid precursors
are relatively proportionately increased in number and show
normal maturation.  Megakaryocytes are increased number.
Abnormal forms are not seen. A 500 cell manual differential
shows: 0% Blasts, 4% Promyelocytes, 7% Myelocytes, 8%
Metamyelocytes, 38% Bands/Neutrophils, 37% Erythroids, 6%
Lymphocytes, 0% plasma cells.

Biopsy Slides:
The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.  It
consists of a 1.1 cm core biopsy of trabecular marrow with a
cellularity of 70%.  M:E ratio estimate is increased. The bone
appears mildly osteopenic. Erythroid precursors are relatively
proportionately decreased in number in number and have overall
normoblastic maturation.  Myeloid precursors are relatively
proportionately increased in number with normal maturation.
Megakaryocytes are increased in number, with focal loose and
tight clustering.

IMAGING

2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM 2012-09-30 00:00:00:
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). The
right ventricular free wall is thick. There is a 1 cm thick soft
tissue rind abutting the right ventricular free wall, largest at
the atrioventricular groove. This could represent an
acoustically dense epicardial fat pad or an extensive epicardial
tumor/metastasis. Right ventricular free wall infiltration
cannot be excluded, especially in light of the thickened,
hypocontractile appearance. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. Stranding is visualized within the pericardial space
c/w organization. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.

Consider cardiac MRI to better assess the possibility of right
ventricular free wall infiltration

ECHOCARDIOGRAM POST-PERICARDIAL WINDOW: 2012-09-30 00:00:00
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Abnormal
septal motion, likely due to effusive-constrictive physiology
(commonly seen for a limited time after pericadiocentesis).
Mediastinal mass abutting the right ventricular free wall.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2012-09-30 00:00:00,
the 123 Any St.usly seen pericardial fluid is no longer present. Both
ventricles appear larger as a result. No evidence of tamponade
physiology.

READ BY: Brucelee Toll

ECHOCARDIOGRAM 2012-09-30 00:00:00
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. There is a mediastinal
mass compressing the heart.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of significant pericardial fluid or
tamponade physiology. Mediastinal mass anterior to the right
ventricle.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2012-09-30 00:00:00,
the septal bounce has resolved. Other findings are similar.

2012-09-30 00:00:00 Echo
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45 year f with past medical history of hypothyroidisim
presenting with diaphoresis, presyncope, and severe DOE and
found to have an anterior medialstinal mass  consistnet with
Primary Mediastinal Large B- Cell Lymphoma on pathology,
transfered from CCU after pericardial window and resolution of
tamponade to BMT service for intiation of R-UPMCE

#Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma- The patient
presneted with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. A CT chest done
as part of her evaluation was notable for a anterior mediastinal
mass. Biopsy of the pericardium and mediastinal mass was positve
for B-cell lymphoma. R-UPMCE chemotherapy was intiated for
treatement, and a bone marrow biospy was done. The patient
experienced an adverse reaction during infusion of rituxan ( see
below), but tolerated the remainder of her treatment course
without complication. She will follow up with her primary
oncologist Dr. Colter Renas for further mangement.

# Afib w/ RVR- the patient triggered twice during infusion of
rituxan on Day 1 of R-CHOP.  During the infusion of Rituxan on
Day 1 of R-CHOPthe patiet became hyptoensive to 80s/50s, with
associated palpitations,  but arousable when the rate of Rituxan
was increased from 50 to 100 mg/hr. The patient was found to be
in afib with RVR ( Hrs 130s-150s) on telemetry ( confirmed by
EKG). Rituxan was stopped, IV hydrocortisone 100mg x2 was and 1
L IVFs were given. The patient convereted to NSR HR in he 80s
with out any intevention, and resolution of palpitation. The BMT
atending was notified and the decision wasmade to restart
Rituxan at 0mg/hr,and if an further complications would stop
completely. Two hours after inital episode the patient was
satiing 91 on 2L, was normotensive with HR 80. Rituxan was
stopped pending repeat echo, as asses cardiac function. 3 hours
after discontinuing Rituxan the patient returned to Afib with
RVT, HR 130s, although the patient was asymptomatic at this
time. She received IV metoprol mg x 2, and started on metoprolol
12.mg PO ID.  She converted back to NSR 1 hour later. An echo
was done the next morning, significant for an LVEF > 55%. Her
afib was most likley a exaggerated inflammatory reaction to
Rituxan.   She was evaluated by cardiology who did not recommend
long term anticogualtion for her afib, and to rate control with
nodal agents if recurred. ?She had no further episodes during
her hospital course

# Pulmonary Embolism- The patient was found to have a right
subsegmental PE and on CTA. She was treated with a heparin gtt
and transitioned to Lovenox on discharge. Duration of therapy to
be determined by primary oncologist.


# pericardial effusion/tamponade-  The patient  most likely had
a malignant effusion secondary to her Primary Mediastinal Large
B-Cell Lymphoma. Went for pericardial window 2012-09-30 00:00:00, drained 250cc
fluid.  Gram stain of fluid and tissue negative for organisms,
2+ polys and 0 polys, respectively.   Pericardial drain was
pulled on 2012-09-30 00:00:00 and f/u echo showed resolution of pericardial
effusion. She was monitored with serial echos during her
hospital course which did not show reaccumulation of the
pericardial effusion.

# Urinary tract infection- The patient noted to have hematuria.
A UA and Urine Cx were sent which grew Proteus. She was treated
with a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin.

----------
CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES

# hypothyroidism-  The patient was continued on  home
medications levoxyl, cytomel
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Toll,
It was a pleasure participating in your care at UPMCE. You were
admitted to the hospital because you were feeling short of
breath, lightheaded, with associated sweating. You were found to
have a  cancer in your chest ( Primary Mediastinal large b cell
lymphoma) and a blood clot in your lungs ( Pulmonary Embolism).
You were also found to have a clot at the site of your PICC
line, and the line was ultimately removed. You were started on
blood thiners to treat your blood clot ( Lovenox also known as
enoxaparin) which you will continue to take on discharge. For
you cancer you finished your first cycle of chemotherapy and
will follow up with your primary oncolgoist Dr. Colter Renas at the
appointments scheduled for you below. Your Neupogen was
discontinued prior to discharge, because your white count was
elevated. Please discuss with Dr. Colter Renas when to resume these
injections at your next visit
