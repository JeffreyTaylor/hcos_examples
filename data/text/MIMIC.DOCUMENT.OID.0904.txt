CXR 2005-02-07 00:00:00:
No focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation identified. Diffuse

coarsening of the interstitial markings appears unchanged from
multiple
123 Any St.us examinations, consistent with chronic interstitial
changes.

RUQ ultrasound 2005-02-07 00:00:00:
Stable ultrasonographic appearance of the right upper quadrant
from 2005-02-07 00:00:00. No gallstones or evidence of cholecystitis. A
small amount of ascites. Echogenic kidney consistent with
medical renal disease or HIV nephropathy.

CXR 2005-02-07 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the chest with no acute
cardiopulmonary process. However, normal chest x-ray does not
exclude PCP Jalis Hader.

echo: 2005-02-07 00:00:00:
The left atrium is elongated. LV systolic function appears
moderately
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is
mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of 2005-02-07 00:00:00, left
ventricular systolic function is now slightly worse.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  bacteremia - Pt's blood cultures showed Klebsiella oxytoca,
which was not surprising given his recent Klebsiella oxytoca
bacteremia.  It was thought that the presence of pt's Portacath
was likely a colonizing factor and the urgency of its removal
was increased.  Pt was initially admitted to MICU as had septic
physiology.  MUST protocol initiated, pt fluid resuscitated with
6L of NS and transfused with 1U PRBC, broad spectrum antibiotics
given - initially levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime in the
ED, then levofloxacin, meropenem, and clindamycin.  He did not
require any pressors.  A cortisol stim test was performed, with
empiric steroids begun, but there was no evidence of adrenal
insufficiency, so this was discontinued.  Pt did not have signs
of a perirectal abscess or UTI, and CXR did not show pneumonia.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative, and on transfer to the
floor, pt remained afebrile and was hemodynamically stable.
Eventually, the portacath was removed by surgery, and the tip
was sent for culture.  It ultimately did not grow any organisms.
 After the Portacath was removed, the plan after discharge was
for him to return for surveillance cultures, and then to get a
tunneled catheter placed the following week.  He was given a
2-week course of levofloxacin for the Klebsiella oxytoca,
starting from the date of Portacath removal.

2.  acute renal failure - baseline creatinine from 2005-02-07 00:00:00
was 1.4 - 1.6; of note, during his last hospitalization, Cr rose
into 2's, as it was during the initial stages of this
hospitalization.  At baseline, pt has echogenic kidney
consistent with HIV nephropathy vs medical renal disease;
however, clearly had an acute on chronic process, and his urine
lytes revealed a FENa of 1.3%, consistent with neither ATN nor
prerenal etiology.  Pt was treated with IVF while awaiting these
results, with little change in his creatinine.  However, he
continued to have good urine output and began to experience a
diuresis concomitant with a decreasing creatinine shortly prior
to his discharge, supporting ATN as the etiology of his ARF.
This was thought most likely to be due to hypoperfusion during
the period of sepsis on presentation.  Of note, urine eos were
negative, as well.

3.  diarrhea - Pt had diarrhea after admission to the hospital,
after having received broad spectrum antibiotics.  This raised
the concern for C diff.  Stool studies were sent, which were all
negative.  His diarrhea resolved within a few days, without a
specific enteric pathogen identified.

4.  anemia - Pt had Hct around 24 on transfer, with a normal MCV
and high RDW, pointing to a combination of microcytic and
macrocytic anemias.  He was transfused 2 U PRBCs with good
response.  He was guaiac negative.  This was thought to be due
to multifactorial processes, including bone marrow suppression
with medications given his retic count of 1.2%.  In addition,
acute renal failure was thought to be a contributor.  His
hematocrit thereafter remained stable at about 30.

5.  CHF - pt's last echo showed an EF of 45%.  There were no
acute issues while in the hospital, and pt tolerated aggressive
IVF given in the setting of his initial sepsis without
significant pulmonary edema.  A repeat echo showed some interval
worsening of his systolic function.

6.  HIV/AIDS -  Pt was not on HAART during his hospitalization.
He was continued on dapsone for PCP Jalis Hader (has an allergy
to Bactrim), pyrimethamine for toxo prophylaxis, and
clarithromycin for Earldine Offringa prophylaxis.  He was continued on aldara
and ketoconazole.

7.  FEN/GI - Pt was maintained on a house diet.  His
electrolytes were repleted as needed, particularly potassium,
which was likely low in the setting of diarrhea.
