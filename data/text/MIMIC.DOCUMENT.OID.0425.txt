Pertinent Results:
Echo 2010-12-23 00:00:00: PRE-BYPASS: There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is aortic valve stenosis (area 1.1
cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate (2010-12-23 00:00:00+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: The aortic valve
prosthesis appears to be well seated. No evidence of any
perivalvular leak. The peak gradient across the aortic valve is
20 mmHg. Biventricular function appears to be well preserved.
The mitral valve has a persitent level of mild regurgitation .
Normal aortic contour post decannulation.
Head CT 2010-12-23 00:00:00: Loss of Kenyen Teetzel-white matter differentiation and
ill-defined hypodensity in anterior left frontal Hannemann, [**First Name3 (LF) **] be
secondary to motion artifact, however, cerebral edema in the
setting of acute brain ischemia cannot be excluded. Consider
performing MR Evelyn Hannemann-weighted imaging or CT perfusion
for further evaluation.
EEG 2010-12-23 00:00:00: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a
poorly organized and somewhat slow background with multifocal
slow transients. This pattern is consistent with a moderate
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, and/or anoxic etiology, and
can also be seen in patients with significant bilateral or deep
midline white matter lesions. No evidence of asymmetries of
voltage or frequency were seen to suggest embolic or
cortically-based strokes. No epileptiform features were seen.
CXR 2010-12-23 00:00:00: Status post AVR. Right jugular CV line is in upper
right atrium as 123 Any St.usly noted. No pneumothorax. There are low
lung volumes with bibasilar atelectases and a probable small
left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Hannemann was a same day admit following all pre-operative
work-up done as an outpatient. On admit day he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent an Aortic Valve
replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU
for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day he
was weaned from sedation and extubated. Initially following
commands, but then movements became inappropriate and he was
non-conversant. Neurology was consulted and head CT, EEG, and
echo were performed. CT was questionable for CVA, but over the
next several days his Neuro status improved and by post-op day
four he was A&O x 3, following commands with appropriate speech.
Neuro felt like episode most likely related to opioid
analgesics. During these several days post-op he remained in the
CSRU and was started on Beta Blockers, Diuretics, and his pre-op
meds. He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
Renal followed pt. during entire post-op course secondary to
transplanted kidney and prior HD. On post-op day five he was
transferred to the SDU for continued care. He had episode of
Atrial fibrillation on this day, beta blockers were increased
and Amiodarone was initiated. He continued to have Atrial
Fibrillation during rest of hospital course and was started on
Coumadin. On post-op day seven there was some sternal drainage
and he was started on antibiotics. On post op day 8 he was ready
for discharge with VNA services.  Plan for INR to be checked
2010-12-23 00:00:00 with results to Dr Evelyn Hannemann for further dosing, goal
INR 2-2.5.
