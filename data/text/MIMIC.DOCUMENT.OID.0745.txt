voltage in the
limb leads. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
123 Any St.us tracing  of 2007-03-10 00:00:00 ventricular ecopy and low voltage
are new.
TRACING #2

2007-03-10 00:00:00:  Liver/gallbladder ultrasound:

 IMPRESSION:
Findings concerning for acute cholecystitis in the appropriate
clinical
setting with a positive sonGislaine Hesketh Gislaine Hesketh sign in a distended
gallbladder containing stones and sludge.

2007-03-10 00:00:00:  chest x-ray:

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Interstitial edema is not
significantly changed;
however, there is increasing opacification at the right lung
base which may represent atelectasis, although superimposed
infection cannot be excluded.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
pneumothorax.
Azygos fissure is again noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. A small amount of free air underneath the
hemidiaphragms is again noted
consistent with recent laparotomy.

2007-03-10 00:00:00:  EKG:

Normal sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
tracing #1
the rate is slightly faster. Other findings are similar.
TRACING #2

2007-03-10 00:00:00:  chest x-ray:


FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2007-03-10 00:00:00, there is little
change in the amount of free intraperitoneal gas beneath the
hemidiaphragm, consistent with prior surgery. Some residual
opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis
and possible effusion, though in the appropriate clinical
setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to
be considered.
No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion at this time.









Brief Hospital Course:
  The patient was seen in the emergency department and was
determined to have acute cholecystitis. He was taken to the
operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Due to the
patients severe disease, this was noted to be a very difficult
dissection, and the cystic duct was taken using Elvern Pehling Hesketh stapler
rather than the classic clips. The remainder of the procedure
was prolonged, but otherwise uncomplicated. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PACU for
further recovery.  He recovered from anesthesia without
difficulty and was transferred to the floor for observation. His
initial recovery was uneventful and on the normal course for a
difficult cholecystectomy. On POD 2, however, the patient was
noted to have desaturations to 81% ad was found to be in new
onset Afib. This was controlled with lopressor and the patient
was transferred to the intensive care unit. A CT PE protocol was
negative for PE, and the patient was loaded with diltiazem and a
drip was maintained overnight. The patient converted back to
normal sinus rhythm and his oxygen saturations recovered to his
normal preop levels. He was given lasix for his fluid overload
and to assist in prevention of continued afib. Following this,
the patient was transferred back to the floor for the remainder
of his recovery.
  He returned to the regular floor on 2007-03-10 00:00:00.  He continued to
have episodes of rapid heart rate which were controlled with
metoprolol.  His regular diet was resumed.  His foley catheter
was discontinued on POD #4 and he has been voiding without
difficulty.  He was evaluated by physical therapy who
recommended a rehabilitation facility to improve his overall
conditioning in hopes of him attaining optimal recovery. Today
he will complete his final day of unasyn.
  He is preparing for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.
His vital signs are stable and his episodes of rapid heart rate
have diminished.  He is tolerating a regular diet.  He is
voiding without difficulty.  He will follow-up with the Acute
Care service in 2 weeks.
