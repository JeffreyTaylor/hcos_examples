Pertinent Results:
========
GI
========
Colonoscopy Impression: Diverticulosis of the descending colon
and s123 Any St. flexure One of the diverticulum had evidence of clot
present. This one was located near the s123 Any St. flexure.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

EGD Impression: Erythema at the GE junction, question of
Barrett's esophagus. Erosions in the antrum and stomach body No
source of GI bleed found Otherwise normal EGD to second part of
the duodenum

========
RADIOLOGY
========
Bleeding Scan INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of
autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m, blood flow
images and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were
obtained. A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.
Blood flow images show physiologic distribution of blood flow.
Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of gastrointenstinal
system bleed.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of GI bleed.
.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of infarction,
hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. The density values of the brain parenchyma are
within normal limits. The Zayvin Branch-white matter differentiation is
preserved. The soft tissues and surrounding osseous structures
are not remarkable.
IMPRESSION: Normal study.

========
ECG
========

Atrial fibrillation with mean rate of 96. Compared to the
123 Any St.us tracing
ST segment changes are less pronounced.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) GIB: Pt was admitted for BRPR. He has had a significant drop
in his hct from a baseline of 48 to 27.3  The pt had one more
bright red stool in the ED. NG lavage was negative. Pt receieved
7 U PRBC, 6 U FFP and Vitamin K. He was placed on an IV PPI.
Coumadin and Aspirin were held in the stting of a GIB.
Colonoscopy was significant for extensive diverticulosis with
the presence of clot. EGD was negative for bleeding, but
suspicious for Barrett's esophagus. The patient's Hct remained
stable in the low 30s and he was transferred to the medicine
floor. He had a normal stool before d/c and did not have any
further BRBPR.
.
2) Afib: Pt rate controlled at home on verapamil. This was
stopped in the setting of  GIB. Pt required some prn Lopressor
in the MICU for rate control. Once pt was hemodynamically stable
his Verapamil was restarted. The pt triggered soon after he was
sent to the Medicine floor for HR >140. ECG demonstrated A fib.
Pt required Lopressor IV 5 mg x 1. His verapamil was titrated up
to his home dose and he remained rate controlled, but he did not
remain rate controlled. His dose was increased to 180 mg UPMCE and
he was rate controlled thereafter. In the setting of a GIB, the
patient's coumadin and aspirin were stopped. He was given an
appointment with his cardiologist to decide whether these
medications should be restarted as an outpatient.
.
3)  Syncope: likely from hypovolemia from blood loss. Recent
cardiac stress testing was good, showing no structural heart
disease. One set of cardiac enzymes were negative and EKG is
unchanged from priors. CT head negative.
.
4)  Acute on chronic renal failure: last year, patient's
creatinine started to trend upwards to 1.3, today it is 1.6.
Likely prerenal azotemia in the setting of chronic renal
failure. With appropriate volume resusication, Cr trended down
to 1.2 on day of d/c.
.
# HTN: Initially home anti-HTN were held in the setting of
hemodynamic instablity. These were restarted in the MICU, and pt
had stable VS in the MICU and on the medicine floor.
.
# OSA: Pt on home CPAP. Pt was kept on CPAP during this
hospitlization.
.
# FEN: Diet was advanced as tolerated and tolerated fulls before
d/c
.
# Access- 2 Large bore PIVs; will get 3rd Blasco, [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to
consider CVL
.
# PPx:pneumoboots given GI bleed, IV ppi

requiring blood transfusion and fresh frozen plasma
Anemia

Discharge Condition:
stable, normal vital signs


Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital with GI bleeding. In the ED you
syncopized and were found to have a heart rate of 10. You
received 10 units of red blood cells and 6 units of fresh frozen
plasma. Your blood counts were below your baseline but stable
thoughout your hospitilization. An upper endoscopy revealed
Barrett's esophagus, but no upper sources of bleeding. A
colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticulosis that were likely
the source of your bleed. There were no active lesions, but some
clot was observed. Your experienced some fast heart rates which
were likely secondary to stopping your at home Verapamil You
were transferred to the medical floor and your at home dose of
Verapamil was restarted. Your heart rate was well controlled at
this dose.

In the setting of a GI bleed, your coumadin and aspirin were
stopped. Please continue to hold these medications until you
follow up with your outpatient physicians.

Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any
bleeding, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, dizziness, syncope or any change in your
condition

Followup Instructions:
Please f/u with your Cardiologist Dr. Zayvin Branch on 2006-09-06 00:00:00 pm at
2:20 pm. Please f/u with Dr. Blasco (gastroenterology) on 2006-09-06 00:00:00 at
2:30 pm. Please f/u with your PCP Blasco. Blasco at 2006-09-06 00:00:00 at 3:40
