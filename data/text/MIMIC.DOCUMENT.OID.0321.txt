Imaging:
2007-04-05 00:00:00 CT Abdomen/Pelvis
Impression:
1. Status post sigmoid colectomy and prostatectomy. No
small-bowel
obstruction. Moderate fecal load, limiting the evaluation of
intraluminal
colonic mass but no obstructing mass is noted. No colonic wall
thickening.  No acute diverticulitis.
2. Right inguinal hernia with a loop of non-obstructed small
bowel.
Fat-containing left inguinal hernia.
3. Interval progression of T12 compression fracture since 2007-04-05 00:00:00
with now
almost complete loss of vertebral height, but minimal
retropulsion into the spinal canal.
4. Stable left adrenal nodule. Cholelithiasis without acute
cholecystitis.  Unchanged increased lung base interstitial
marking suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.
5. Status post AAA repair with persistent thrombosed Jayra Spuhler.
6. If clinical concern remains high for colonic mass, recommend
followup with colonoscopy.
.
2007-04-05 00:00:00 CXR
Cardiac size is top normal. There is no change in diffuse
emphysema and
peripheral reticular abnormality, left greater than right,
consistent with
pulmonary fibrosis. There is evidence of loss of volume in the
left lung
consistent with left upper lobe wedge resection. Mild increase
opacity of the left lower lobe is likely atelectasis. There is
no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are no new lung
abnormalities suggestive of pneumonia.
.
2007-04-05 00:00:00: colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the whole colon. Large
amount of old blood and clots were seen throughout the colon,
but not in the terminal ileum. This is likely a right-sided
diverticular bleed. No active, ongoing bleeding at present.
Limited view of mucosa given extensive old blood.

Brief Hospital Course:
Acute blood loss anemia 2007-04-05 00:00:00 GIB: The patient was initially
admitted to the MICU for a GI bleed.  Serial hematocrits were
stable after receiving 2 units of PRBCs from 2007-04-05 00:00:00
(admission)-2007-04-05 00:00:00 and he was transitioned to the regular medical
floor. Pt was maintained with 2 large bore IVs, active type and
screen, consented and crossmatched. His home aspirin and
antihypertensives were held. GI was consulted and recommended
colonoscopy for the morning on 2007-04-05 00:00:00.  Colonoscopy showed
multiple diverticuli and bleeding (see above). Overnight on
2007-04-05 00:00:00 pt had 2 episodes large volume BRBPR with HR in 110s.
Pt recieved 2U of PRBCs and did not have further bleeding until
2007-04-05 00:00:00 when he started to have melanotic stools. His hematocrit
was trending down and he was transfused to a hematocrit of >28.
His melana resolved and GI felt an EGD would not be necessary at
this time. It was felt his melana was residual blood from his
123 Any St.us bleed. In total pt recieved 6 123 Any St. throughout
hospitalization.

# Dementia: continued namenda

# Hypertension: lisinopril and metoprolol were held. They were
held upon discharge as well and based on patient's outpatient
blood work and blood pressure readings, the decision should be
made in the outpatient to restart these medications.

# CAD: aspirin was held

# SC nodule: pt was noted to have a small subcutaneous nodule
very low in LLQ. Pt stated that it had been present for many
years (though pt is variable historian). Management deferred to
primary care provider.

# Prostate/Lung/Colon/Skin cancer: management deferred to outpt
providers.

# HLD: continued lipitor

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for bleeding for bloody bowel movements. You
had a colonoscopy which showed out-pouchings of your colon
(called diverticulosis) without active bleeding or polyps. The
bleeding initially probably came from one of those outpouchings
but we could not tell which one. After your colonoscopy, you
started having bleeding in your stool again. This time the
bleeding slowed down considerably. Your blood levels remained
stable. It was felt the minimal blood in your stool was residual
blood from your 123 Any St.us bleed. You should follow up with your
outpatient doctor for a re-check of your blood level.

You also had some difficulty with shortness of breath. A CT scan
was performed that did not show any acute concerning causes of
shortness of breath. This may be due to underlying lung disease.
Your oxygen levels were normal while walking. You should follow
up with your doctor for further managment.

When you go home please continue your home medications with the
following changes:
1. HOLD Lisinopril 5 daily
2. HOLD Metoprolol 25 mg UPMCE
3. HOLD Aspirin 81 mg daily
****These two medications should be re-adjusted at your follow
up visit on UPMCE. Your blood pressure was not elevated and
with concern for bleeding, these were not re-started.***
4. START Protonix 40 mg twice a day. This will help decrease the
acid in your stomach.

It is important that you keep all of your doctor's appointments.
