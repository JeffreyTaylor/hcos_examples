History of Present Illness:
34 yo woman with h/o hypertrophic CMY, multifocal atrial
tachycardias s/p failed PVI 2011-05-27 00:00:00, c/b pericardial tamponade c
window c/b PEA arrest x 45 minutes 2011-05-27 00:00:00 with temporary CVVHD,
and recent admission for SOB, treated for volume overload, who
was admitted with chief complaint of shortness of breath and
chest pain. Initial vitals in ED showed T 97, HR 55, BP 124/66,
RR 19, with o2 sat 100% on 4L. Pt. being evaluated by resident
in ED, denying CP, when she acutely c/o dyspnea and was noted to
have wide complex rhythm on tele and lost pulse. Given 2 rds
epi, 1 rd atropine, 2 rds bicarb/ca chloride/insulin/D50 for
presumed hyperkalemia as initial EKG showed sine wave pattern.
Also given 2L IVFs. She was coded for 30 minutes after which she
regained pulse and EKG showed NSR with wide complex with RBBB.
Initial BP 202/68. She then developed wide complex ventricular
tachycardia with BP 68/p, for which she was defibrillated X 1
200J and started on dopamine. At that point, she returned to NSR
and was quickly weaned off dopamine gtt.
.
She had non-sterile R femoral line placed for access. Initial
labs (during code) showed K 5.5 on ABG (unclear if before or
after tx. for hyperkalemia) with ABG of 6.92/63/50. Bedside TTE
without pericardial effusion. CXR showed new R>L pleural
effusions, and given difficulty of oxygenating, R Chest tube
placed with estimated 200cc out. She was transiently placed on
dopamine gtt for hypotension s/p code, but quickly SBPs returned
and dopamine weaned.
.
Per patient care referral, pt. c/o nausea and pain at 8:30 this
AM, with SOB, lethargy, diaphoresis. Per initial nursing note in
Jacklon Gruszka, pt. also reports diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain over last
few days. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with RBBB. Pt. reported
to weigh 192.9 lbs, which is 2011-05-27 00:00:00 lb. decrease from admission.
Vitals were significant for no fever, BP 80s-100s/50s-70s,
satting 100% on 2L. Pt. with cold extremities, so was
transferred to UPMCE.


Past Medical History:
# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Cardiac MR on 2011-05-27 00:00:00 with asymmetric LVH with maximal wall
thickness of 19mm at mid septum with focal hyperenhancement
consistent with hypertrophic CM. EF 55%.
# SVT with A fib, left atrial tach and AVNRT s/p pulmonary vein
isolation on 2011-05-27 00:00:00.
# Questionable history of WPW
# Tobacco use with bronchitis and associated multifocal a tach.

# Anxiety

Cardiac History:
The patient initially presented with syncope at age of l2. At
l3, the patient was seen at UPMCE for history of
syncope, chest pain and progressive exercise intolerance. She
was found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. She was
subsequently cathed. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure was
found to be 20. She was then started on chronic Verapamil
therapy. At age l6, she experienced cardiac arrest secondary to
complex tachycardia. She was successfully resuscitated. Repeat
catheterization showed left ventricular end diastolic pressure
of 36-40 without outflow tract obstruction. EP showed inducible
atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular blood pressure. She was
felt to have a rapid antegrade conduction and possible
pre-excitation. She was started on Norpace. Since then, the
patient has been stable on Verapamil and Norpace with occasional
palpitations, chest pain and light headedness.

Social History:
Currently on disability. 40 pack-year smoker (2ppd x20 years)
quit since recent bronchitis. No EtOH. Regular marijuana use.


Family History:
Family history remarkable for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
congenital aortic stenosis s/p cardiac surgery during infancy.
No family history of sudden cardiac death or premature CAD.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN
Jacklon Gruszka: In comparison with study of 2011-05-27 00:00:00, the right chest tube
has been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax.
Otherwise, little overall change. The right-sided parenchymal
opacification persists, as does the retrocardiac opacification
consistent with atelectasis and effusion. The other tubes remain
in place.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2011-05-27 00:00:00 8:10 AM
As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, the monitoring and
support devices are in unchanged position. Unchanged position of
the right-sided chest tube, the side port of the chest tube is
still in the thoracic wall and slightly outside the lung. The
right-sided parenchymal opacity is further resolving. Subtle
increase of the retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, no
newly-appeared parenchymal opacities. No evidence of pleural
effusions.
.
ECHO 2011-05-27 00:00:00:
Conclusions
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no valvular Jacklon Gruszka or resting LVOT gradient. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is high normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2011-05-27 00:00:00, the
magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure have decreased.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on 2011-05-27 00:00:00 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  2011-05-27 00:00:00 2:06 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier films of this date, there
has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip
in the upper portion of the SVC. The opacification at the right
base is slightly less prominent and there has been a better
inspiration.
The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
.
ECG Study Date of 2011-05-27 00:00:00  11:22:44 AM
Sinus rhythm. Peaked P waves consistent with right atrial
enlargement. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2011-05-27 00:00:00 right bundle-branch block has appeared.
Clinical correlation is suggested
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  2011-05-27 00:00:00 11:19 AM
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart remains enlarged,
and there are new, ill-defined airspace opacities at both bases,
most likely due to edema given the rapid time appearance.
Pulmonary vasculature remains slightly engorged. A focus of
linear opacity in the left lung base is likely atelectasis. The
upper lung zones remain relatively well aerated with no focal
consolidation or pneumothorax.
A right PICC terminates at the origin of the SVC.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in pulmonary edema, with
persistent cardiomegaly and fluid overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
34 yo woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, multifocal atrial
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, h/o AVNRT, with
multiple 123 Any St.us cardiac arrests with PEA arrest, likely 2011-05-27 00:00:00
hyperkalemia.
.
# s/p PEA arrest: Etiologies include hyperkalemia, vs. other
acidosis which 123 Any St.ated hyperkalemia. Unsure of what
123 Any St.itated hyperkalemia. patient was receiving KDur
supplements at UPMCE, however this still should not have been
enough to cause her degree of hyperkalemia. patient has been
hypokalemic since admission, and has required K supplements.
During resuscitation patient had two lines placed which were
non-sterile.  She was therefore given prophylactic vancomycin
and aztreonam until the lines could be removed. The lines were
removed after two days, once her INR was reversed with IV
vitamin K. She did not develop any ekg findings suggestive of
hyperkalemia throughout her hospitalization.  She did not
develop any further episodes of ventricular tachycardia
throughout her hospitalization.  She will need follow up of her
electrolytes as per discharge orders.
.
# Fluid Status: Patient was total body fluid overloaded
throughout her hospitalization, requiring IV lasix to improve
urine output. She was eventually transitioned to her home dose
of lasix 80mg PO daily. Her lasix dosing was increased to 80mg
PO BID on 2011-05-27 00:00:00, as she still had an oxygen requirement and was
still reporting edematous extremities.
.
# Rhythm. History of multiple atrial tachyarrhythmias s/p recent
failed ablation. Anticoagulated w/ coumadin as outpatient given
frequent AT with RVR. the patient developed atrial flutter on
2011-05-27 00:00:00. This was treated with amiodarone, verapamil and increased
doses of metoprolol. An ablation was considered to be
unnecessary at this time given her history of complications with
procedures.  Her coumadin was restarted, and eventually
increased to 4mg PO daily, which is double her home dose, to be
titrated according to INR goal 2011-05-27 00:00:00.  She should have her INR
drawn according to discharge orders, on 2011-05-27 00:00:00.
.
# Respiratory status: She was extubated on 2011-05-27 00:00:00, and was weaned
to 96% O2 saturation on 4L.  CXR showing possible RLL opacity
vs. fluid overload. Her montelukast and atrovent was continued.

.
# Fever: Unclear etiology. had persistent leukocytosis at
123 Any St.us admission, s/p 10 day course with aztreonam and clinda,
finished on 2011-05-27 00:00:00.  Spiked temp to 101.9 2011-05-27 00:00:00.  However, her
leukocytosis persisted during this admission. She was pan
cultured and cultures have been negative.  She was not started
on another regimen of antibiotics during this admission after
com123 Any St.g her 123 Any St.us 10 day course.
.
# Weakness: PT evaluated Ms. Gruszka and recommended rehab
placement.  However, she refused.  She also refused to attempt
climbing Gruszka, [**First Name3 (LF) **] her ability to do so was not able to be
evaluated.  She was sent home in an ambulance and with help to
get into her house.
