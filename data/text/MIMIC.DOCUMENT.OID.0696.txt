CHEST PA AND LATERAL.

INDICATION: Status post bypass surgery, evaluate for effusion.

FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
position. Status post sternotomy and multiple surgical clips in
the anterior
left-sided mediastinum are present. When comparison is made with
the next
123 Any St.us portable chest examination of 2007-02-26 00:00:00, the
123 Any St.usly
present wide caliber internal jugular vein sheath has been
removed. No
pneumothorax has developed. Accessible pulmonary vasculature is
not
congested. Bilaterally, there remains some mild blunting of the
lateral
pleural sinuses seen to extend in the posterior pleural sinuses
on the lateral
view. Crowded vasculature and obliteration of the left-sided
diaphragmatic
contour is consistent with 123 Any St.usly made diagnosis of left
lower lobe
posterior segment atelectasis. Also seen on the right base is a
very thin
plate atelectasis in the right middle lobe territory. No other
new
abnormalities are identified. When comparison is made with the
preoperative
PA and lateral chest views of 2007-02-26 00:00:00, the now
increased heart shadow
is consistent with postoperative pericardial changes and
moderate degree of
postoperative mediastinal widening. Further followup to confirm
resolution of
atelectases and pleural erosions is recommended.

IMPRESSION: Regression of postoperative mediastinal and
pulmonary changes. No
pneumothorax remaining.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the body of the LA. No mass/thrombus in the 123 Any St. (123 Any St.es) **] 123 Any St.es) **] LAA. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying
velocity (<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA. All four pulmonary
veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
EF was initially around 35% with anterior wall hypokinesis, both
of which improved with infusions of NTG and dobutamine .
3. An epiaortic scan was done to identify the aortic cannulation
site. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. Schlicht was notified in person of the results in the
operating room.

POST-CPB: On infusions of phenylephrine, dobutamine.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted preoperative for bridge with heparin infusion from
coumadin.  Was brought to the operating room 2007-02-26 00:00:00 and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft surgery, MAZE, and left atrial
appendage ligation.  Vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics
due to being in the hospital preoperatively.  See operative
report for further details.  He was transfered to the intensive
care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  In the first twenty four
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without complications.  On the first post
operative day his creatinine increased to 2.5 and renal was
consulted.  Based on lab data he was found to be pre renal, no
evidence of ATN and received intravenous fluids and allowed
blood pressure to be increased due to baseline 150-180.
Creatinine was continued to be monitored and progressively
improved over the next few days. Lasix was resumed and
creatinine remained stable.  He did remain in the intensive care
for extended days to monitor renal function.  Physical therapy
worked with him on strength and mobility.  He continued to
progress and was ready for discharge to rehab on post operative
day five.  Plan for coumadin 6mg daily with INR check 2007-02-26 00:00:00 for
further dosing with goal INR 2.0-3.0. He has received coumadin
starting 2007-02-26 00:00:00 - 3mg (2007-02-26 00:00:00, 2007-02-26 00:00:00) 5mg (2007-02-26 00:00:00, 2007-02-26 00:00:00)
