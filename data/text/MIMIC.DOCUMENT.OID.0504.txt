History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old bedbound Somalian speaking only woman well
known to UPMCE with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic hyponatremia, history of
pulmonary embolus on coumadin and recent admissions to ICU with
enterobacter/klebsiella/pseudomonas bacteremia who presents from
rehab with hypoxia and decreased responsiveness in setting of
apparent aspiration. Events at rehab unclear but during
hemodialysis, patient desatted to 74%. Apparently a code was
called but event details not known. Pt was suctioned which
produced "thick yellow sputum and vomit". Concern of MD at that
time was of mucus plug verse aspiration. Pt placed on
nonrebreather and transferred to UPMCE. Pt unable to give
detailed history given baseline mental status. Son says patient
has not been feeling right since yesterday. Reports decreased PO
in setting of abdominal pain and nausea/vomitting. Of note
patient is a known chronic aspirator with history of failed
multiple speech and swallow evals. Patient's family aware, yet
continues to take PO despite inherent risks because patient
refusing tube feeds. Per son, patient without specific complaint
and she looks much improved than earlier in the day.
.
Patient was discharged from UPMCE 2 days prior to admission
after being admitted with fevers and hypotension. Initially
started on meropenum/linezolid in the ICU and then narrowed to
meropenum for which she is currently com123 Any St.g a 7 day course
(day 2). Blood culture data negative. Tagged WBC scan with
uptake in femor:? osteo vs healing fracture. Needed MRI for
further eval but given poor surgical candidate opted for medical
treatment.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 69 year old bedbound Somalian speaking only
woman with endstage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes
mellitus type 2, chronic hyponatremia, history of pulmonary
embolus on coumadin, history of enterobacter/klebsiella
bacteremia (2010-02-28 00:00:00), klebsiella and pseudomonas UTI (2010-02-28 00:00:00) who
presents status post hypoxia and hypotensive episode.
.
.
*. Hypoxia: Patient was admitted with hypoxic episode thought to
be secondary to aspiration versus mucous plug.  She was brought
to UPMCE and placed on a nonrebreather and was admitted to the
MICU. Initially she was hypotensive but responded to IVFs.
Chest x-ray did not show a pneumonia and CTA was done which did
not show evidence of PE but did show some tracheobronchomalacia,
which could have caused the patient's symptoms.  At that time,
she was not intubated.  She was a known aspirator who had failed
multiple speech and swallows in the past.  In the MICU she was
given tube feeds through an NG tube.  She was stable for the
floor after several days and did well for some time on room air.
 A PEG tube was placed for feeds so the patient could reduce her
PO intake and risk of aspiration. Several bedside speech and
swallow evaluations were done and recommended only small amounts
of PO food for pleasure.  On 2010-02-28 00:00:00 the patient was noted to be
less responsive and more tachypneic that improved with
suctioning.  On 2010-02-28 00:00:00 the patient was noted to be hypoxic to
63% on room air.  Chynia Lafon RN thought the patient had an episode of
emesis prior to the event and food particles were removed with
suctioning.  The patient was intubated and sent to the MICU at
that time. She was extubated on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 and sent back to the
floor on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.  She did well on the floor for a few days,
though at times she appeared more tachypneic.  Multiple chest
x-rays were done and showed no new infiltrates.  The patient's
family wanted to continue feeding her, so a video swallow and
esophagram was done.  It suggested the patient was at risk to
aspirate thin liquids and was refluxing her food. She was
already on lanszoprazole and reglan prior to this.  She was
continued on aspiration precautions and allowed small volumes of
food at a time.  Patient was subsequently transferred back to
the MICU on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 given concern for new sepsis and
hypercarbia.  She was noted to be febrile to 100.3, tachycardic
to the 100s with a blood pressure of 77/40 on forearm.  When the
cuff was moved to her upper arm, the blood pressure was found to
be 120/60.  Respiratory rate was noted to be in the 40s, 98% on
2L.  Chest x-ray was unchanged.  ABG 7.27/61/90 with a lactate
of 1.4.  Hypercarbia was thought to be secondary to lethargy and
confusion. However, Patient had received a liter of fluid on the
floor and no sedative medications prior to new lethargy.
Increased CO2 in the setting of tachypneia was thought to be
attributed to either increased CO2 production from infection or
worsening dead space ventilation.  Patient was intially started
on vancomycin on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 and subsequently switched to linezolid and
meropeneum for pseudmonas in leg wounds on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.  She was
reintubated on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 for resp acidosis and successfully extubated
without complications.  While on the floor, she was breathing
comfortably and sat'ing in high 90's on room air. Patient was
NPO and continued on tube feeds.
.
.
*. Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive at admission and treated
with IVFs.  She became hypotensive again at hemodialysis and was
on pressors for one day.  She was weaned off pressors after
fluid boluses.  She was on meropenem at admission and improved
with fluid boluses so likely not sepsis.  Could have been
secondary to hypovolemia or fluid shifts associated with HD.
She was transferred to the floor and remained hemodynamically
stable.  She completed a full 14 day course of meropenem and she
was weaned off the steroids she had been started on in the MICU.
Patient was subsequently stable and discharged to the floor.
Patient was subsequently transferred back to the MICU on 2010-02-28 00:00:00
given concern for new sepsis and hypercarbia.  She was noted to
be febrile to 100.3, tachycardic to the 100s with a blood
pressure of 77/40 on forearm.  When the cuff was moved to her
upper arm, the blood pressure was found to be 120/60.
.
.
*. Leukocytosis: Multiple sources of infection including coag
neg Staph pansensitive, coag neg Staph oxacillin resistant and
vancomycin resistant enterococcus from PICC line; C diff in
stool and pseudamonas in LE wounds.  Considered PICC line,
dialysis cath and leg wounds as sources of infection.  In
addition, chronic urinary tract infections, aspiration pneumonia
and c diff were also considerations. PICC line was removed on
2010-02-28 00:00:00.  Hemodialysis catheter was changed over wire by IR on
2010-02-28 00:00:00.  Patient finished 14 day course of flagyl on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 for C.
diff.  Patient started on a 14 day course of linezolid (for VRE
& Staph) and meropenem (for pseudamonas) on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.
Transesophageal echo was negative for vegetations and was not
suggestive of no endocarditis.  After resuming antibiotics
patient remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile with
downtrending WBC.
.
.
*. Fevers: Patient spiked fevers several times during the
admission.  Could have been secondary to line infection, urinary
tract infection, pneumonia or possible osteomyelitis.  There was
also a question of possible osteomyelitis in the past, but it
was decided not to do an MRI earlier because no further
intervention would be done based on the results.  Patient also
had a question of aspiration pneumonia at admission but nothing
was ever seen on chest x-ray.  Blood cultures durng the early
part of her admission showed no growth, so it was thought that
UTI may have been the source. later in her admission she
developed c. diff which could have contributed, as well as
infection in leg ulcer.  Her fevers subsided on meropenem, which
was re-started empirically for her fevers. She completed a
7-day course from 2010-02-28 00:00:00 in addition to the intial course of
meropenem she completed.  Patient was noted to have a new fever
on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 and was subsequently resumed on meropenum and linezolid
for a 14 day course.
.
.
*. Urinary tract infections: Patient was noted to have a
significant recent history of UTIs leading to sepsis.  Several
urine samples were obtained during her stay and UA suggested
UTI.  urine cultures grew out yeast or mixed bacterial colony
types. There was a concern that UTIs were leading to urosepsis.
the patient had been started on Meropenem (for her
enterobacter/Kleb/psuedomonas UTIs )at her last admission and
she was continued for a 14 day course.  After the Meropenem was
dc'd she did well for several dsy, remained afebrile with stable
WBC.  She then developed low grade fevers.  She was re-started
on meropenem but per ID she was just to be continued on a 7 day
course, because she had already been colonized by bacteria
resistant to other antibiotics.  Her fevers resolved and were
thought to be secondary to urinary tract infection, though last
few urine cultures grew out yeast only.  She was treated with
fluconazole for 7 days for the yeast.  Blood cultures showed no
growth.  It was thought that the patient will likely continue to
get repeat UTIs as she makes a little urine that stays in the
bladder for long periods of time. Spoke with ID regarding
possible prohpylactic antibiotics, but they were resistant to
start this as patient already had developed resistance to many
bacteria. Spoke with urology multiple times and they suggested
qod straight caths to relieve the patient of urine.  This was
attempted in the hospital but required 4 people to perform it.
Additionally, little urine came out through this method, because
much of it was sludge.  Spoke with urology who stated she should
make an appointment as an outpatient and they would try to come
up with the appropriate regimen for straight cath.  ID also
recommended trying qd cranberry tablets. Patient will be on
meropenum until 2010-02-28 00:00:00 and linezolid until 2010-02-28 00:00:00 then left IJ line
may be pulled if patient has peripheral IVs.
.
.
*. Endstage kidney disease - The patient is hemodialysis
dependent (M/W/F) and received hemodialysis throughout her stay.
 She was followed by renal.  She was arranged to have outpatient
hemodialysis at UPMCE. Tunnelled HD cath was replaced per IR
on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.  Continued nephrocaps.
.
.
*. Melena: Patient developed melena during her admission, while
on heparin.  Her hematocrit did not drop and she was continued
on protonix. Her anti-coagulation was not stopped because she
had recently had a very severe pulmonary embolism and required
anti-coagulation.
.
.
*. History of pulmonary embolus: Patient had a recent history of
PE status post PEA arrest.  Her goal INR was 2010-02-28 00:00:00 and coumadin
was adjusted to keep her in this therapeutic range.  When she
was subtherapeutic, she was on a heparin drip.  Patient was
therapeutic on coumadin at discharge.  She will likely need
anticoagulation for at least 12 months.
.
.
*. History of atrial fibrillation : Her course was complicated
by new atrial fibrillation with RVR while on Levophed for
pressure support, was cardioverted with 200 J with successful
return of MAP.  Had transient atrial fibrillation during her ICU
course without any hemodynamic instability, which spontaneously
resolved.  INR was intially supratherapeutic INR 4.0 then 1.9
reversed with 3U FFP for central line placement.  Heparin drip
was started on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 for anticoagulation and coumadin was resumed
on 2010-02-28 00:00:00. Patient was continued on warfarin 5mg PO QHS with goal
INR 2010-02-28 00:00:00.  Heparin drip was discontinued on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.
.
.
*. Sinus Tachycardia: Patient was found to be in sinus
tachycardia on the floor and remained like that for many days.
Was thought to be likely secondary to and infectious process or
fluid shifts during HD.  PE was less likely since patient was
anticoagulated. Now resolved.
.
.
*. Diarrhea: Patient had intermittent diarrhea throughout her
course.  Her c.diff toxin assay was checked several times during
the admission and was initially negative. She was found to be
positive for c. diff on 2010-02-28 00:00:00 and started on Flagyl for a 14 day
course which she completed on on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.
.
.
*. Diabetes: She was well controlled on a sliding scale and had
QID fingersticks. Patient was started on insulin drip for better
BS Control goal 80-120.  Weaned insulin drip to off and restart
ISS on 2010-02-28 00:00:00.
.
.
* Decubitus/Ischemic ulcers: She had ulcers on the posterior
aspect of her calves. They were healing well but during her
admission she was noted to have some purulent exudate from the
left leg. This area was superficially swabbed and found to be
growing pseudomonas.  She was already being treated with
meropenem at that time.  An x-ray was done at the time and
showed no evidence of osteomyelitis on films.  Vascular surgery
was contactChynia Lafon and did not think any intervention was necessary
at this time.  She was followed by the wound care team and wound
care recs were implemented.  Patient is now on wet to dry twice
daily wound care.
.
.
* FEN - Patient was initially fed with an NG tube in the unit.
The necessity of a PEG tube to help patient's nutritional status
and reduce the risk of aspiration was discussed with her family
and a PEG tube was placed by IR on 2010-02-28 00:00:00. The patient was
started on tube feeds with probalance and was followed by
nutrition.  She failed several speech and swallow evals and was
noted to be at risk for aspiration, with reflux events by video
swallow.  She was placed on aspiration precautions and only
allowed to take 30 cc/hr of food PO.  She was continued on
nephrocaps and her lytes were repleted PRN.  After an episode of
possible aspiration patient was kept NPO and continued on tube
feeds only. Prior to discharge, PEG was chronically plugged
despite UPMCE flushes, discontinuing banana flakes and
viokase infusions. GJ tube imaging showed patent and functional
lumen. Interventional radiology was consulted and replaced tube.
Tube requires vigorous flushing with 1/2NS after administering
medications or tube feeds per tube using a 10cc syringe (to
obtain enough pressure) as patient is prone to tube clogging.
Make sure flushes are with normal saline, 10cc syrine and
uncapped.
