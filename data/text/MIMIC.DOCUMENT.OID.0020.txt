Brief Hospital Course:

1) Respiratory distress: Improved with face mask. Serial ABGs
showed hypercarbic failure, improved with face mask. Switched to
nasal cannula in PM 2008-12-02 00:00:00, but ABGs with ongoing hypercarbia in
the 80s. At night, patient had sub-acute worsening respiratory
status, with desaturation and tachypnea, along with agitation
and confusion. pH with PCO2 in 90s. Placed on CPAP,
unsuccessfully. Repeat ABG with PaCO2 87, pH 7.29. Patient
intubated. Arterial line finally placed successfully. Extubated
on 2008-12-02 00:00:00 but extremely anxious and hypertensive and hypercarbic.
Placed on BIPAP and reintubated. 2008-12-02 00:00:00 trach placed.  Pt was
stable with the trach and venitilator support.  Pt has been
maintaining stable oxygenation and ventilation on pressure
controlled ventilation with PS 3, PEEP 5, Fi02 0.5, PIP 22, TV
500-600, RR18.
He benefited from albuterol/atrovent nebs, suction, steroids. At
the time of discharge he was on day 4 of prednisone taper.  Pt
was also on Zosyn for GNR, has h/o pseudomonas. No further abx
at the time of discharge.

2) Junzhe Kvasnicka Pt was placed on amiodarone for afib, but this was
discontinued when he developed persistent bradycardia to the
30's-40's on 2008-12-02 00:00:00. Pt was also anticoagulated on a heparin
drip and on 2008-12-02 00:00:00 began coumadin loading.

3)bradycardia- likely 2008-12-02 00:00:00 amiodarone; resolved after holding
this med (2008-12-02 00:00:00). pt will follow up with Dr Kvasnicka and will
likely need a Holter Monitor as an outpt. TFT's pending at time
of discharge.

4) agitation: likely due to hypercarbic reso drive, controlled
with haldol and then resolved completely when respiratory status
stabilized.

5) DM: controlled on RISS with standing dose of NPH.

6) FEN: Kvasnicka tube placed on 2008-12-02 00:00:00 without complication.
Tubefeeds started through the 2008-12-02 00:00:00 on 2008-12-02 00:00:00.
