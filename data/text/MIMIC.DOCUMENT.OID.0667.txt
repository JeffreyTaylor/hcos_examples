Past Medical History:
onc hx:
Primary Onc: Dr. Graddy Ailport
Metastatic Breast ca- in past, undewent chemo w/
adriamycin/cytoxan, then taxol. Then, she received
5FU/leukovorin and Zometa. Her course has been complicated by
compression fractures in T1-T6 and T9.  She underwent radiation
treatment for T1 and developed more pain and T6 then was found
to have a compression fracture with cord compression. She was
hospitalized while she started radiation treatment. The decision
had initially been made to continue her chemotherapy through her
radiation treatment as a radiation sensitizer; however, the
patient had episodes of severe nausea and vomiting and diarrhea
resulting in additional  hospitalizations. She is finishing off
her radiation treatments with the omission of 5-FU leucovorin.
She was restarted weekly taxol on 2011-11-05 00:00:00 until 2011-11-05 00:00:00.  Pt was
switched to gemzar since 2011-11-05 00:00:00 due to apparent progression of
disease. CT on 2011-11-05 00:00:00 showed progression in size of liver mets and
development of new right sided pulmonary nodules. PET 2011-11-05 00:00:00
showed widespread metastatic bone lesions which were stable in
intensity and number.

DATA:
2011-11-05 00:00:00 CXR: The heart is of normal size. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is
normal without evidence of CHF. There is a right chest wall
Port-A-Cath with the tip in the cavoatrial junction. There are
again noted surgical clips overlying the left breast. There is a
patchy opacity in the right perihilar region and infrahilar
region with nodular densities, which is likely due to post-
radiation changes. No definite evidence of pneumonia is seen.
There is a stable compression fracture of T6 and T9 vertebral
bodies. There are surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa and
subcutaneous tissues in the left abdomen. The patient is status
post TRAM flap. The patient is status post left mastectomy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Post-radiation changes. No evidence of pneumonia.
2. Stable compression fractures of T6 and T9 vertebral bodies.
.
Ultrasound of abdomen 2011-11-05 00:00:00: FINDINGS: Gallbladder is not
seen as patient is status post cholecystectomy. Common duct is
not dilated. The liver appears echogenic consistent with fatty
liver. Multiple rounded hypoechoic lesions are seen within the
liver, the largest measuring 2.5 cm in largest dimension. The
right kidney measures 11.2 cm. The left kidney measures 11.6 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis or stones. The pancreas and spleen
appear unremarkable. The aorta is of normal caliber throughout.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple hypoechoic lesions seen within the liver
corresponding to findings on CT performed 2011-11-05 00:00:00. These
findings are suggestive of liver metastases.
2. The liver is echogenic consistent with fatty liver. However,
other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease,
including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, cannot be
excluded on the study.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.
.
CXR 2011-11-05 00:00:00: History of metastatic breast cancer with fever.
Right subclavian CV line is in distal SVC. No pneumothorax.
Right para mediastinal post-radiation changes as 123 Any St.usly
demonstrated. No new pulmonary consolidation or pleural
effusions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia or other change since
prior film of 2011-11-05 00:00:00.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47 yo F w/metastatic breast ca s/p multiple regimens of
chemo and XRT, most recently Gemzar 2011-11-05 00:00:00, p/w fever to 102
and mild hypotension.
.
1. Fever of unclear etiology/hypotension: In the UPMCE, the
patient was empirically covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and
azithromycin.  Her hypotension responded to IVF and 2 units of
PRBCs.  Pt was transferred to the floor on 2011-11-05 00:00:00 in a stable
condition. The patient did not require any IVF and maintained
her SBP in the 90s with good PO intake. The vancomycin and
cefepime were subsequently discontinued as the patient remained
afebrile, not neutropenic, and cultures remained negative, and
switched to Levaquin. The source of fever remains unclear as
final urine and blood cultures are negative and repeat x-ray
showed no pneumonia(Port-A-Cath was a concern although the site
looked clean, but the patient remained afebrile off of
vancomycin).
.
2. Anemia/guiaic + stool: Pt's hct was 23.8 (baseline 30) and
stool was heme + in the ED. In the ED hct over several hours
stayed stable.  New anemia was felt likely due to chemotherapy
as other cell lines also decreased. The patient received 2 units
of PRBC in the UPMCE, resulting in appropriate rise in hct to
32.2. Her hct remained stable on the floor. For GI consulted in
ED and no acute recs for colonoscopy/ imaging. Of note, the
patient has chronic + heme since Xeloda induced colitis.
.
3. Elevated LFTs- Was felt to be secondary to liver mets and/or
Gemzar. Pt did not have any abdominal complaints. U/S of abdomen
showed echogenic liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions
consistent with corresponding to findings on CT performed
2011-11-05 00:00:00.
.
4. Metastatic breast ca- s/p Gemzar 2011-11-05 00:00:00. The patient was
continued on neurontin and oxycontin for peripheral neuropathy.
.
5. Hypertriglyceridemia: Continued tricor. Since the patient has
a h/o pancreatitis with elevated TG, triglyceride was rechecked
and was improved to 578 (2011-11-05 00:00:00 1397)  The patient had normal
amylase and lipase during this hospitalization.
.
6. H/o R ovarian v clot: Continue coumadin (unclear effect as
INR 1.2)

7. Depression/anxiety: Continued Wellbutrin and Lexapro. Ativan
for sleep prn.
.
8. FEN: Received IVF for hydration and regular diet
.
9. Proph: PPI, pneumoboots; on coumadin.
