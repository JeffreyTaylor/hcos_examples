History of Present Illness:
37F with history of lupus, lupus nephritis with ESRD on
peritoneal dialysis on transplant list, hx of PE/Antiphopholipid
antibody on coumadin, mitral regurg, presents with 4-6 month
history of cough, worse in the morning, one week of trace blood,
now producing bright red blood over last couple days. Patient
states that the amount of blood she has been coughing has been
increasing and is now almost hourly, aprroximately 1 teaspoon
bright red blood. Patient states that the cough produced
primarily yellow sputum until it turned to blood. Patient denies
any other symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness. She
denies any changes in her BMs, including consistency, frequency,
and color.  Patient visited PCP on Christa Labounty, and a CXR was
negative. Her was also noted to be subtherapeutic and she took
an extra day of 10 mg warfarin as instructed.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were: 108 138/95 18 100% RA. Her HCT
was 29.6, her baseline is unclear but appears to be low 30s. INR
was 4.4. A CTA was done for concern of PE which showed: 1. Left
lower lobe consolidation with large amount of secretions/fluid
within the left lower lobe segmental bronchi. 2. Centrilobular
nodules and ground glass opacities throughout both lungs,
compatible with chronic collagen vascular disease, progressed
since 2013-05-04 00:00:00. Ground glass opacities could also represent
hemorrhage. 3. Chronic left lower segmental pulmonary arterial
PE, unchanged since 2013-05-04 00:00:00.  No new acute PE detected to the
subsegmental levels.  She was initially admitted to medicine but
then transferred to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU initial vitals were: 110 163/96 20 95%RA.
She is breathing comfortably but complains of pain in her chest.
Her EKG was reviewed which did not show changes from her prior.
She also complains of a HA that she says she occasionally
recieves toradol. She has had emesis in the ED that looked
dark/possibly coffee ground but currently denies nausea.

2013-05-04 00:00:00 CTA CHEST
The lung apices are excluded from this examination, which was
optimized for assessment of the pulmonary vasculature.
Coarse calcifications within the breasts are new on the left
(2:33), and
slightly increased in size on the right (2:24), in comparison to
the 2013-05-04 00:00:00 examination. No distinct mass is seen,
although the breast tissue is diffusely dense.
There is no axillary or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The heart
size is top
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. The aorta is normal in
caliber and patent. There is no dissection.
The main pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber. There is a
chronic
pulmonary embolus within the left lower segmental pulmonary
artery (3:57),
which is present since the 2013-05-04 00:00:00 CT examination. No superimposed
acute
pulmonary embolus is detected to the subsegmental levels.
Endobronchial secretions are seen within the left lower lobe
segmental
bronchus (3:54), extending into the left lower lobe, where there
is a
moderate-sized consolidation (3:86) filling a 123 Any St.usly-seen
large air
collection from 2013-05-04 00:00:00. There are neighboring areas of
tree-in-Christa Labounty
and ground-glass opacities (3:72). Ground-glass and tree-in-Christa Labounty
opacities are also seen throughout both lungs, slightly worse at
the lower zones (right lower lobe 3:104, right middle lobe
3:109, right upper lobe 3:49, lingula 3:95), distributed along a
centrilobular pattern, with associated mild bronchiectasis, all
progressed since 2013-05-04 00:00:00. There is no pleural effusion. Mild
pleural thickening along the left lower lobe (3:78) has slightly
progressed since 2013-05-04 00:00:00.
Moderate intraabdominal ascites is present.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no bony lesion concerning for
infection or
neoplasm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe consolidation with large amount of
secretions/fluid within the left lower lobe segmental bronchi. A
small air-filled space within the left lower lobe seen on the
2013-05-04 00:00:00 CT examination is now filled with fluid and/or blood.
Findings could represent hemorrhage secondary to collagen
vascular disease. Infection and abscess also have the same
appearance on CT.
2. Centrilobular nodules and ground glass opacities throughout
both lungs,
with a basilar predominance, with associated mild
bronchiectasis, compatible with chronic collagen vascular
disease, progressed since 2013-05-04 00:00:00. There is no advanced fibrosis.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded by imaging alone.
Ground glass opacities could also represent hemorrhage.
3. Chronic left lower segmental pulmonary arterial PE, unchanged
since 2013-05-04 00:00:00. No new acute PE detected to the subsegmental levels.

.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 CXR
CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
Suspect background hyperinflation. Superimposed on this, the
heart is not
enlarged. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
There is patchy dense opacity at the left base, increased
compared with
2013-05-04 00:00:00. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a
small effusion.
Smudgy densities scattered in the right and ? left upper lung
are compatible with ground glass oapcities seen on chest CTA
obtained earlier the same day.
There is minimal biapical pleural scarring. Note is made of
calcification
along the bronchial walls, an unusual finding in an individual
of this age.
A large (13 mm) coarse calcification overlying the right lung
lies within the right breast.
Minimal superior endplate scalloping is noted in several
mid/upper thoracic vertebral bodies.
IMPRESSION: Irregular dense opacity at left base, increased
compared with 2013-05-04 00:00:00, associated with an elevated left
hemidiaphragm. Differential diagnosis includes alveolar
processes such as infection and hemorrhage.
.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 CT ABD/PELVIS
ABDOMEN: There is atelectasis at the left base with a small left
pleural
effusion. Centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities at
the right base remain unchanged from CTA chest performed
yesterday.
Lack of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the solid
abdominal viscera.
The liver, spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas demonstrate a
grossly
unremarkable unenhanced appearance. The kidneys are small in
size. There is vicarious excretion of contrast within the
gallbladder from contrast CT
performed yesterday. Nonenlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are
visualized.
There is no adenopathy. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber
with
atherosclerotic calcifications noted predominantly infrarenally.

A peritoneal dialysis catheter is present, looped in the right
mid abdomen
entering from the left. There is a moderate amount of ascites,
which measures higher than simple fluid in Hounsfield units.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
PELVIS: The bladder, uterus and rectum are within normal limits.
Ascites is redemonstrated within the pelvis. There are no
dilated or thick-walled loops of bowEl. There is no inguinal or
pelvic adenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are present in the
right hip
and sacroiliac joints. A sclerotic 9-mm lesion in the left iliac
bone appears nonaggressive and is essentially unchanged from
2013-05-04 00:00:00 suggesting a benign lesion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate ascites. Given the fluid withdrawn from the
peritoneal dialysis catheter is nonhemorrhagic, and the patient
underwent a contrast-enhanced CT yesterday, this is likely
increased in density from the contrast administration. No
evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Vicarious excretion of contrast in the gallbladder consistent
with stated history of chronic kidney disease.
3. Left basilar disease is poorly evaluated on this examination.

Centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities are
redemonstrated consistent with known chronic collagen vascular
disease. Again, superimposed infection cannot be excluded by
imaging.
.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 FLUOROSCOPIC-GUIDED EMBOLIZATION L BRONCHIAL ARTERY
FINDINGS:
1. Existing right IJ temporary triple-lumen catheter was seen
with the tip in the axillary vein. This was successfully
repositioned/replaced with the new catheter tip positioned in
the distal SVC.
2. Angiography demonstrated dilated tortuous left bronchial
artery, supplying the left lung and specifically, the left lower
lobe. Some filling of an adjacent pulmonary artery was seen at
the end of the angiography suggesting microvascular shunting.
3. No contributor was identified from the left bronchial artery
anywhere in its course to an anterior spinal artery.
4. During selective microcatheterization of the left bronchial
artery, a
small amount of contrast extravasation was noted in the
mediastinum from the proximal portion of the artery. Subsequent
aortic angiography demonstrated no contrast extravasation from
the aorta or evidence of aortic dissection.
5. Following this, 5 French Labounty was again used to select
the ostium of the left bronchial artery. From this location,
particle embolization with 300-500 micron Embospheres was
performed to good slowing of flow and
angiographic result.
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful particle embolization in the left bronchial
artery, as
described above.
2. Successful replacement and repositioning of non-tunneled
right internal
jugular vein triple lumen catheter, with the tip now in distal
SVC. The line is ready to use.
.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 CT CHEST
FINDINGS:
AIRWAYS AND LUNGS: Since 2013-05-04 00:00:00, high-density
consolidation in the
left lower lobe sparing only a portion of the superior segment
has increased and new in posterior basal segment of the right
lower lobe. Preexisting left lower lobe cavity is obscured by
this large consolidation. In addition,
diffuse ground-glass opacities without septal thickening in both
lungs (left side more than right), are also new since 2013-05-04 00:00:00
2013-05-04 00:00:00. Keeping with clinical history, these are highly suggestive
of multifocal pulmonary hemorrhage, most pronounced in the left
lower lobe. Thin rim of hyperdensity along the
posterior pleural space in the left lower lobe is probably due
to the
dissection of the blood from the consolidation.
MEDIASTINUM: Thyroid gland is normal. Endotracheal tube tip lies
3 cm above the carina. There are no pathologically enlarged,
mediastinal,
supraclavicular or axillary lymph nodes. Heart is normal size,
and thin rim of pericardial fluid is likely reactive. Coronary
artery calcification is minimal.
ABDOMEN: The study is not designed for assessment of
subdiaphragmatic
pathology; however, limited views were remarkable for moderate
ascites with an attenuation value ranging between 19 to 35,
suggesting complex fluid, unchanged since 2013-05-04 00:00:00.
BONES: There is no bone lesion concerning for malignancy or
infection.
IMPRESSION:
1. CT featuRes are concerning for progressive multifocal
pulmonary hemorrhage, most pronounced in left lower lobe.
2. Left lower lobe bronchial tree occlusion is likely from
aspirated blood.
3. Moderate ascites with attenuation ranging between 19 to 35 is
probably
complex fluid, unchanged since 2013-05-04 00:00:00.
.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, there is
substantial
improvement with substantially improved ventilation of the left
lung. Only at the left lung base, areas of atelectasis with
subsequent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm persists.
Two new tubular structures project over the left hemithorax.
There is no
evidence of pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are
overall
constant. Constant appearance of the right lung.
.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 LENIS
FINDINGS: There is normal phasicity within the common femoral
veins
bilaterally. The visualized vessels are patent and compressible
with normal waveforms and augmentation. No thrombus identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT within the lower extremities
bilaterally.
.
2013-05-04 00:00:00 TTE
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet
of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Poor image quality (patient difficult to position
and unable to cooperate). Preserved regional and global left
ventricular systolic function. Based on limited views, right
ventricular cavity size and function are probably normal.
Pulmonary pressures were undetermined.
Compared with the prior study dated 2013-05-04 00:00:00 (images reviewed),
left ventricular function is more vigorous. Other findings are
probably similar although current suboptimal image quality
precludes definite comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
37F with SLE c/b lupus nephritis, w/ESRD on PD & bilateral PE on
chronic coumadin p/w hemoptysis & hypoxic respiratory failure,
found to have L bronchial artery bleed.

# HEMOPTYSIS
On admission pt was HD stable, not hypoxia, and without airway
compromise. She did have significant Hct drop, from 29.6 to 20.8
within 24h of admission. Pt is on chonic coumadin for hx
bilateral PE 11y ago; INR was elevated to 4.4 on admission.
Explanation for acute bleed not entirely clear - initial ddx
included infection (PNA vs abscess) in setting of elevated INR
most likely; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage also possible, &
rheumatology consult also suggested possible pulmonary
vasculitis. No new PE seen on CTA. She initially received
antibiotics for possible pulmonary infection (vanc/levo/flagyl,
subsequently narrowed to levo/flagyl). On HD3, underwent
CT-guided pulmonary angiography for question source of bleed and
possible bleeding into mediastinum. Bleed localized to L
bronchial artery, which was embolized. Solumedrol started for
possible vasculitis. Hct stabilized and uptrended thereafter.
There was discussion of possible pulmonary wedge biopsy for
purpose of solidifying a tissue diagnosis to guide possible
immunosuppression but this was decided against after
risk/benefit analysis. Discharge Hct 35.9. Sent home w/steroid
taper to be further managed in rheumatology follow-up next week.

.
# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
Pt developed respiratory failure while in the ICU, w/increasing
O2 requirement. CXR showed significant left-sided infiltrate,
most likely from L bronchial arterial bleed (as discussed
above). Pt developed progressive respiratory distress requiring
supplemental O2. She was intubated on HD4 for rigid bronchoscopy
and was difficult to extubate, first because of persistent
L-sided infiltrate (blood) and volume overload (retained >5L
over 3-4d from PD), then because she developed ventilator
associated pneumonia (VAP). She was already on levo/flagyl at
the time (coverage for possible pulmonary infection as
123 Any St.itant for hemoptysis, discussed above);
aztreonam/vancomycin added briefly for VAP coverage. On repeat
bronchoscopy on HD9, large mucous plug removed from LUL
bronchus. Pt's respiratory status improved quickly thereafter,
and she was successfully extubated the following morning. Weaned
to RA within several hours, O2 sat in high 90s/RA for >48h
thereafter.
.
#CHRONIC PE/ANTICOAGULATION
Hx indication for anticoagulation was revisited during this
admission given hemoptysis and supratherapeutic INR on
admission. No acute PE on CTA. [**Year (4 digits) **] was consulted and agreed
w/continuing to hold anticoagulation. IVC filter placed. Review
of OMR records revealed that anticoagulation was started in
2013-05-04 00:00:00 during hospitalization for lung abscess; large bilateral
PEs were revealed on CTA done for unexplained persistent sinus
tachycardia. She has been on anticoagulation since. OMR also
include diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in
OB/GYN notes (based upon 3 miscarriages and hx CVA age 14) but
rheumatology notes/records show autoantibody panel not c/w this
diagnosis (Kayly Cullotta positive 1:320, anti-Ro/La positive, lupus
anticoagulant negative x2, *anticardiolipin negative*.
Rheumatology and hematology were consulted here for assistance
with re-evaluation of pt's indication for chronic
anticoagulation and plan to resume anticoagulation. Repeat
serologies sent - lupus anticoagulation now *positive*,
anticardiolipin again negative, b2glycoprotein Ab pending at
time of discharge. Discharge anticoagulation plan as follows:
- IVC filter to be removed in ~1 week (IR aware, procedure
scheduled for 2013-05-04 00:00:00)
- Resume warfarin after IVC filter removed, with f/u INR checks
at UPMCE clinic overseen by PCP Labounty. Kayly Cullotta. 2013-05-04 00:00:00 require
re-hospitalization to restart warfarin, TBD by PCP and 2013-05-04 00:00:00/pulm
in outpatient follow-up
- PCP, Christa Labounty, Rheum and Pulmonary follow-up appointments arranged
- situation discussed with Rheumatologist Dr. Labounty who
will review paper records for any OSH coagulopathy studies sent

# SINUS TACHYCARDIA
Pt's HR was 100 on admission and trended 100-140 during her
hospital status. Always sinus tachycardia on EKG and telemetry.
Given hx PE, she had bilateral LENIs and a TTE to evaluate any
right heart strain. Both were wnl. No CTA was obtained because
a) pt had an IVC filter placed on admission so low-likelihood
and b) no anticoagulation would have been restarted as an
inpatient given recent life-threatening bleed.

# Hx ESRD on PD
Renal failure chronic, lupus nephritis. Underwent PD throughout
hospital stay. Initially there was some difficulty evacuating
entire content of PD dwells, and pt became volume overloaded.
Renal consult service followed closely and guided modifications
to PD solution. Pt was euvolemic on PD for 4 days prior to
discharge.
.
# Hx SLE
Diagnosed in 2013-05-04 00:00:00 and followed by Dr. Labounty. Complicated by
nephritis, & recurrent pleural effusions, w/additional ocular
and skin manifestations. Plaquenil was continued while pt able
to take POs; held while intubated & restarted thereafter.
Rheumatology consult service followed, suggested possibility
that lupus vasculitis or other vasculitis might have contributed
to her hemoptysis (see above) and recommended initiation of IV
steroids. Steroid taper to be further managed by rheumatologist
in follow-up.
.
# Hx HTN
Recently stopped lisinopril for concern of exacerbation of her
cough. BP meds held on admission given concern for bleeding.
Used PRN IV labetolol to control BPs while intubated. After
extubation, pt's BP ran
.
# Hx MIGRAINE HEADACHES
Takes amitriptyline at home at night. Amitriptyline + PRN
tylenol while here.
.
# Hx GERD
Continued ranitidine. Pt did have some nausea and PO intolerance
but was able to take small-volume POs prior to discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
1. ANTICOAGULATION
Discharge anticoagulation plan as follows:
- IVC filter to be removed in ~1 week (IR aware, procedure
scheduled for 2013-05-04 00:00:00)
- Resume warfarin after IVC filter removed, with f/u INR checks
at UPMCE clinic overseen by PCP Labounty. Kayly Cullotta. 2013-05-04 00:00:00 require
re-hospitalization to restart warfarin, TBD by PCP and 2013-05-04 00:00:00/pulm
in outpatient follow-up
- PCP, Christa Labounty, Rheum and Pulmonary follow-up appointments arranged
- situation discussed with Rheumatologist Dr. Labounty who
will review paper records for any OSH coagulopathy studies sent
prior to initiation of coumadin in 2013-05-04 00:00:00 and share info w/Dr. Christa
- Warning signs for CVA and DVT/PE reviewed with pt and family
prior to discharge, recommend careful follow-up neuro and
pulmonary exams.
2. STEROID TAPER - to be managed by outpatient rheumatologist
3. Need for ongoing home physical therapy - pt thought to need
intense rehabilitation but refused PT, will need follow-up
evaluation by PCP and likely ongoing home PT

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs. Labounty,

You were admitted to the hospital with a life-threatening bleed
into your left lung. Your INR was >4 so we stopped coumadin. You
underwent a procedure to localize and cauterize the source of
the bleed: a left bronchial artery. You required intubation to
help you breathe as the blood in your left lung resolved. You
had multiple bronchoscopies to remove blood clots and mucous
plugs. You were followed closely by rheumatologists who
recommended steroids to dampen any possible lupus vasculitis,
which could have caused the bleed.

You also developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and were
treated with antibiotics.

Your PCP Labounty. Christa will continue to manage your coumadin. For now,
do not take coumadin. We will recommend restarting coumadin in
approximately 1 week, after IVC filter removal, but the final
decision will be made by Dr. Christa in cooperation with your
hematologist and rheumatologist.

Please see below for a list of warning signs. Please pay special
attention to any difficulty breathing, chest pain including
discomfort with breathing, leg or calf pain or swelling. Also be
aware of warning signs for stroke including sudden weakness or
numbness, difficulty speaking, and change in vision.

We recommended UPMCE rehabilitation because you were very
weak after 10 days in bed in the hospital. Physical therapy did
not think you were safe to go home. However, you refused to go
to rehab.

We made the following changes to your medications:
STOP COUMADIN
STOP LISINOPRIL (RECENTLY DISCONTINUED BY YOUR PCP)
STOP GUAIFENESIN
STOP LOSARTAN, please discuss resuming this medication with your
PCP and Nephrologist
START CHLOROSEPTIC SPRAY FOR THROAT DISCOMFORT, EVERY 6 HOURS
AS-NEEDED
START PREDNISONE TAPER, 40 MG SATURDAY THEN 30 MG DAILY UNTIL
YOU SEE YOUR RHEUMATOLOGIST, WHO WILL GIVE FURTHER TAPERING
INSTRUCTIONS.
START ATIVAN 0.5 mg UP TO EVERY 8 HOURS FOR ANXIETY OR NAUSEA
FOR 10 DAYS. PLEASE DO NOT DRINK 123 Any St. WHILE TAKING
THIS MEDICATION.
