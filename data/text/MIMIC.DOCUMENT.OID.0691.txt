no fevers. Last bowel movement was the day prior. She was

5. Folic acid 1 mg a day.
6. Protonix 40 mg a day.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pleasant, cooperative, in mild
distress. Regular rate and rhythm. Clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, tender to palpation ino the
epigastric area. Rectal exam - guaiac negative, no masses.

Labs include white blood cell count of 17, hematocrit of 44,
BUN of 7, creatinine of 0.9. AST is 106, ALT 419, alkaline
phosphatase 147, total bilirubin 4.4. Amylase 850, lipase
3234. LDH 408.

STUDIES:  CT of the abdomen showed pancreatitis with regions
of relative hypo enhancement in the pancreas, a distended
gallbladder with stone, and distended cystic duct. No
intrahepatic ductal dilation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was
treated with fluid resuscitation. NPO. Gastroenterology
consultation was obtained. By the next day, her enzymes were
improved. The ERCP was held, in consideration that the
patient had probably already passed the stone and was now
improving. Her abdominal examination and her labs continued
to improve until 2011-06-13 00:00:00 when, already on the floor, the
patient started complaining of increased abdominal pain. The
abdomen showed some distension and the patient's hematocrit
dropped down from 31 to requiring blood transfusion. She
underwent emergent CT scan, which showed pseudoaneurysm in
adjacent to an SMA. The patient underwent angio, which
revealed a pseudoaneurysm which was coming off from branches
from the SMA, as well as having a feeder from PDA. They were
able to embolize this pseudoaneurysm, as well as embolize the
feeder from SMA, but not from the PDA.

The patient returned to the ICU, where her blood pressure was
initially controlled with nitroglycerin drip. Over the next
couple of days, the patient's condition has improved. Her
hematocrit remains stable. It was not requiring any
transfusion. Her abdomen, although still mildly distended,
was soft. She was passing gas and having bowel movements. Her
diet was advanced, initially to clears, and the patient went
to a regular diet, which she tolerated well. She started to
ambulate, initially with help, then on her own. She was
transferred to the floor. The vascular service was consulted.
Their CT was obtained on 2011-06-13 00:00:00, which showed no
changes in the pseudoaneurysm, with hematocrits remaining
stable. The patient was otherwise doing fine. The feeling was
that the patient does not need any procedures at this point.

On 2011-06-13 00:00:00, the patient is afebrile. Vital signs are
stable. The abdomen is soft, non distended. Tolerating a
regular diet and ambulating without help. No concerns.
