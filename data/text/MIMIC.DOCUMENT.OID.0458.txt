CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old man s/p mvr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
HISTORY: 56-year-old male status post mitral valve replacement.
Evaluate for infection, effusion.

COMPARISON: 2007-01-01 00:00:00.

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Retrosternal gas and a small air-fluid
level are seen on the lateral view, probably related to recent
sternotomy. The left basilar atelectasis has improved. However,
there is a persistent small left pleural effusion. There is also
a probable small right pleural effusion. The lung fields are
clear. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Sternotomy wires
and artificial mitral valve are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Retrosternal gas and air-fluid level, probably related to
recent sternotomy.
2. Persistent small left pleural effusion and probable small
right pleural effusion.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD or PFO by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild
to moderate (2007-01-01 00:00:00+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate/severe MVP. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on 2007-01-01 00:00:00 where he underwent a
mechanical MVR. He was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition. He was extubated later that day. He was transferred
to the floor on POD #1. He was started on coumadin for his
mechanical mitral valve. He had some atrial fibrillation for
which his beta blocker was increased and he converted to sinus
rhythm. He did well postoperatively. He awaited a therapeutic
INR and was ready for discharge on POD #5. Dr. Makin (Spoke
to Cearra Szymonik at his office) will follow his coumadin.
