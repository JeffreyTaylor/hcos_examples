Chief Complaint:
transfer from cath lab for acute pulmonary edema s/p cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with Drug Eluting Stent Placement.


History of Present Illness:
73 yo male with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
CABG, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral vascular disease PVD was
admitted to UPMCE from UPMCE with after having had
2010-02-05 00:00:00 substernal chest pain. Patient was initially admitted to
UPMCE on 2010-02-05 00:00:00 with a COPD exacerbation and a right
lower lobe pneumonia, being treated with IV antibiotics,
steroids, and nebulizer treatment. On 2010-02-05 00:00:00, patient
experienced 2010-02-05 00:00:00 substernal chest pain with associated bilateral
arm numbness and troponin I of 11. He initially received
morphine and ativan without relief and then received 5mg IV
metoprolol and IV nitroglycerine with relief. On 12.20, patient
found to have troponin I with 83.41 and was transferred to UPMCE
for cardiac catheterization.
.
At cardiac cath, patient found to have the following: 3 vessel
native coronary artery disease; LMCA 50% distal in-stent
restenosis; LAD occluded proximally; LCX 60% at its origin with
occluded OM branches except for OM3 which was occluded distally;
RCA known to be occluded and not selectively engaged; LIMA-LAD
widely patent to distal LAD. SVG-RCA was known to be occluded
and was not engaged selectively.
The SVG-D-OM had an ulcerated 80% stenosis at the diagnoal
origin and
widely patent OM stent. Patient had a drug eluting stent placed
(Cypher 3.5 x 18) to the SVG-Diag-OM. 170cc dye used during
procedure and hemodynamics not performed (Aortic pressure 145/74
with HR 73). Post cath course complicated by development of
acute shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and respiratory
distress, thought likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
Patient started on a NRB and received 60mg furosemide IV total
(20 then 40), morphine 5mg, and was started on a nitro drip for
elevated blood pressures to SBPs to 190s.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was started on BiPap but had
persistent respiratory distress with use of accessory muscles
and increased CO2 retention, as seen on ABG (7.29 / 59 / 160).
Patient was intubated with anesthesia and started on propafol
for sedation. With increased sedation, patient also became
hypotensive to SBPs 70s-80s and was started on dopamine for
blood pressure support.

cor

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with IDDM and COPD who was admitted to the CCU
after presumed flash pulmonary edema , intubated, s/p tube
repositioning
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please re-eval postition of ngt and ett (was ~ 6cm above Irita Smylie)

CHEST: Status post intubation for flash pulmonary edema. Check
endotracheal tube position.

COMPARISON: Film performed at 18:45 same day.

Tip of the endotracheal tube is in good position, 4.5 cm above
the carina. There is blunting of both costophrenic angles which
is new consistent with bilateral pleural effusions. There is new
focal opacity behind the left side of the heart consistent with
atelectasis or infiltrate. Tip of the NG tube is in the stomach.

IMPRESSION: Tubes in good position.

Interval development of new bilateral pleural effusions and new
left lower lobe opacity. There is moderate pulmonary vascular
redistribution, likely due to the supine technique.

PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed an ulcerated,
hazy
lesion in the SVG to Diagonal with jump OM at the takeoff of the

diagonal.  The initial strategy was to direct stent after
thrombectomy
with distal protection.  An Keyri Stralka-1 Guide provided good support.
Bivalirudin was used.  The 4 French RX Angioject catheter was
used with
two passes in an antegrade fashion with moderate debulking of
the
lesion.  A  3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent was deployed at 18 ATM.  A
3.75 x
13 mm Powersail balloon was inflated twice at 20 ATM.  Final
angiography
revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in
the
stent.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and developed
transient
chest pain with balloon inflations.  He complained of dyspnea
during the
case and was administered furosemide.  Despite diuresis, he
developed
increased shortness of breath in the holding area and was then
transferred to the CCU for further management of volume overload
CHF.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel native coronary artery disease. The LMCA
had 50%
distal in-stent restenosis. The LAD was occluded proximally. The
LCX had
60% at its origin with occluded OM branches except for OM3 which
was
occluded disteally. The RCA was known to be occluded and
therefore was
not selectively engaged. The LIMA-LAD was widely patent to
distal LAD.
The SVG-RCA was known to be occluded and was not engaged
selectively.
The SVG-D-OM had an ulcerated 80% stenosis at the diagnoal
origin and
widely patent OM stent.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The systemic
arterial
pressures were elevated measuring 145/74mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and Stenting of the SVG to Diagonal-OM were
performed
with distal protection using a 3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent
(postdilated to
3.75 mm) .  Final angiography revealed normal flow, no
dissection and 0%
residual stenosis.  (See PTCA Comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native 3 vessel coronary artery disease with patent LIMA-LAD,
known
occluded SVG-RCA and known 80% stenosis in SVG-D-OM.
2. Mildly elevated systemic arterial pressures.
3. Successful PTCA and Stenting of the SVG-D-OM with Cypher UPMCE.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
Eccentric AR jet directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS. Trivial MR. Prolonged (>250ms)
transmitral E-wave
decel time. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality
- poor apical
views.

Conclusions:
Acoustic windows were technically suboptimal. The left atrium is
dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric,
directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.





Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
73 yo male with known coronary artery disease, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse, and obesity s/123 Any St.es) 5109**] to
SVG-Diag-OM, complicated by congestive heart failure, acute
pulmonary edema, hypotension, and respiratory failure s/p
intubation.
.
1. CARDIAC
Coronary Artery Disease
Patient was found to have an 80% ulcerated SVG-D-OM lesion which
was stented with a  Cypher 3.5 x 18. Patient was chest pain free
for the duration of his hospitalization. Patient was placed on
aspirin, plavix, high-dose statin, and started back on his home
dose of valsartan 160mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO
daily. Patient was also started on Toprol XL 50 mg daily.
Patient had 123 Any St.usly been taking atenolol 25mg PO bid but was
switched to metoprolol given patient's chronic renal
insufficiency. Patient recommended to discuss this change with
his primary care physician and primary cardiologist.
.
Pump
Patient's initial presentation of acute pulmonary edema during
catheterization was thought likely secondary to his hypertension
and diastolic heart failure. He was initially hypertensive and
started on a nitro drip. As he was sedated and intubated, his
blood pressure decreased and hwas started on dopamine for
pressure support. Once extubated, patient again developed
hypertension and he was re-started on his home medicines of
valsartan 160mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. He was also
started on Toprol XL 50 mg QD. Patient was noted in 123 Any St.us
records to have an EF of 45%, by report from prior cardiology
notes. TTE during this admission demonstrated EF of 55% with 1+
AR. Patient was on Smylie upon admission, unclear from our records
or patient history whether he has been tried on an ACE inhibitor
such as ramipril. Patient recommended to discuss with his
primary care physician and primary cardiologist whether he
should be on an ACE inhibitor such as ramipril.
.
Rhythm
Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm for the duration of his
admission and was monitored with telemetry.
.
2. Respiratory Failure
Patient initially with respiratory distress after cath, likely
secondary to flash pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension and
congestive heart failure. Patient was initially intubated for
respiratory distress and received lasix for aggressive diuresis
and was extubated one day later without complication. Upon
discharge, patient was stable on room air.
.
3. Hypercholesterolemia
Patient was initiated on high dose statin therapy with
atorvastatin 80mg PO daily.  He should have another lipid panel
checked in 30 days and his liver function and CK followed by his
PCP.
.
4. Pneumonia
Patient was transferred from OSH with findings of right lower
lobe pneumonia, per report. Patient received a 5 day course of
antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone/ azithromycin for 3 days
then 2 days of levofloxacin. Patient symptomatically improved
with decreased cough and sputum production by discharge.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitus
Patient received insulin drip for a short time while he was
intubated and was quickly transitioned to his outpatient insulin
regimen of 25U NPH in the morning, 25U at bedtime, and sliding
scale at meals.  It was noted that patient also required high
doses of insulin on the sliding scale in addition to his NPH
dosing and pt also reports that he often takes greater than 18
units per day on his own sliding scale.  No adjustments were
made to his regimen while he was an inpatient here, but this
issue should be addressed as an outpatient.
.
6. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency with Mild Proteinuria
Patient noted to have chronic renal insufficiency with baseline
Cr ~1.5, likely secondary to diabetes mellitus. During this
admission, his creatinine bumped slightly to 1.8, thought likely
secondary to prerenal causes with diuresis and decreased forward
flow. Upon discharge, patient's creatinine had improved to 1.4.
.
Patient also noted to have mild proteinuria with a
protein/creatinine ratio of .3. His chronic renal insufficiency
and mild proteinuria are thought to be likely secondary to his
diabetes mellitus but he was recommended to have a further
work-up of his renal insufficiency by his primary care
physician.
.
Patient will follow up with his PCP and his cardiologist Dr.
Smylie.

Discharge Instructions:
Please take all medications as prescribed. While it is important
for you to take all of your medications, it will be especially
important for you to take your aspirin and plavix every day. You
are recommended to take plavix for one year after your discharge
from the hospital.
.
If you have any symptoms of fevers, chills, night sweats,
light-headedness, chest pressure or pain, shortness of breath,
calf pain, or calf swelling, please go to the nearest emergency
room.
.
Due to your high blood pressure and heart disease, please try to
adhere to a heart-healthy, low sodium diet.

Followup Instructions:

Please go to your follow-up appointment with Dr. Keyri Stralka
Smylie on Monday 2010-02-05 00:00:00 at 3:30pm.  His phone number is

.
Please also follow-up with your cardiologist Dr. Keyri Stralka
Smylie on 2010-02-05 00:00:00 at 11:20am.  His phone number is
test@mail.com.
.
When you meet with your primary cardiologist and your primary
care physician, Irita Smylie discuss the following issues with them:
- evaluation of your sleep apnea and scheduling for a sleep
study
- further evaluation and work-up for your renal insufficiency
and mild proteinuria (small amounts of protein in your urine).
- taking a medication such as ramipril for your blood pressure
and kidney protection
- please note that pt is on NPH 25 UPMCE, but as per pt report,
requires nearly 18 units at home on his sliding scale and also
required additional doses while an inpatient.  Due to his short
length of stay, no changes were made to his regimen.  A better
outpatient regimen is needed for Mr. Smylie to control his
diabetes.
