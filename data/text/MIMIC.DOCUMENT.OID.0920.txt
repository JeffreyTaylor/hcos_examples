Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: Most likely due to RML/RLL pneumonia. Started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED, continued in the MICU.
No PE on CT-A. No evidence of CHF on exam; TTE with LVEF 50-55%
and likely anterior fat pad vs loculated pericardial effusion
(less likely). Continued baseline nebs for COPD. Legionella
urine neg, sputum/ blood cultures with no growth.  Pt stable on
MICU to floor transfer on 2Lnc. Should have outpatient PFTs to
evaluate for amio-induced lung toxicity. Pt switched to PO
azithromycin and cefpodoxime to complete 10 day course of abx
finishing on 2011-09-14 00:00:00.Pt had evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR
consistant with h/o diastolic CHF.  Pt was diuresed with IV
lasix, which improved her respiratory status.  She was given 20
mg. PO lasix upon discharge to move her toward euvolemia.


2. Hypotension: Most likely due to pneumonia-induced sepsis. On
MICU transfer, pt was normotensive and off pressors after fluid
resuscitation since arrival to MICU on HD 1. Justus stim was
appropriate, no steroids indicated. Pt had no problems with low
BPs on the floor and was discharged on home HTN meds.

3. CAD: Cycle cardiac enzymes given ST segment changes on
admission EKG. Repeat EKG morning of 2011-09-14 00:00:00. Continued telemetry
until r/o MI complete HD 2. Continued ASA, atorvastatin. Held
metoprolol 2011-09-14 00:00:00 recent hypotension and normotensive pressures in
MICU. TTE; LVEF 55%, ant fat pad vs ?loculated peric effusion.

4. Right hip cellulitis: pt with underlying ORIF of R hip,
ultrasound demonstrated only subcutaneous edema consistent with
cellulitis, no evidence of fluid collection.  Pt for Keflex
course 500 QID x 5 days. This was completed prior to discharge.

5. Hypothyroid: pt continued on home synthroid

6. Paroxysmal AFib: pt continued on Amio. Normal sinus rhythm
while in MICU.  Question of lack of outpatient Coumadin in
patient with h/o AF AND pvd AND multiple malignancies; for
followup with primary care physician Dr Justus on this subject.
