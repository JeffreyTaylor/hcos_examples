HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with a sudden collapse.  The daughter immediately
called EMS.  The patient was taken to an outside hospital and
was found to have a GCS of 5.  She was intubated, sedated and
transferred to UPMCE for
further evaluation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Lisinopril 40 mg q. day.  2.
Atenolol 12.5 q. day.  3. Celebrex 20 mg q. day.  4. Lasix 20
mg q. day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's blood pressure at the outside
hospital was in the 190s.  She was given Mannitol and blood
pressure was stable on transport.  The patient partially
opened her left eye to sternal rub.  Pupils were 2 down to 1
mm and brisk.  She had positive corneals, positive gag.  She
localized in the left upper extremity to pain, flexor
posturing in the right upper extremity, withdrew bilateral
lower extremity left greater than right.

Head CT showed a large intraventricular hemorrhage with
casting of the left lateral ventricle, blood surrounding the
edema causing shift of midline structures.  She was taken
emergently to the operating room for a left frontal
craniotomy for evacuation of the hematoma.

Upon arrival to the trauma surgical intensive care unit
postoperatively the patient was sedated on propofol.  She was
lightened for examination.  Her pupils were 2 mm and brisk.
Her right corneal was impaired, her left was intact.  Gag was
absent.  Cough was intact.  She did not respond to verbal
stimuli, withdrew bilateral lower extremities to painful
stimuli; left upper localized with painful stimuli, no
response on the right upper extremity.  Her vital signs were
stable and she was intubated and sedated.

On 2011-06-04 00:00:00 the patient opened her eyes to stimulation.  Pupils
were 3 down to 2 mm.  She was moving the left upper extremity
to commands, localizing to the left upper extremity, withdraw
of lower extremities to pain.  The patient had a feeding tube
placed.  The patient spiked to 101.8 on 2011-06-04 00:00:00 and was
fully cultured.  On 2011-06-04 00:00:00 the patient spiked to 102.2.  She
was fully cultured the day prior and levofloxacin was started
prophylactically.  She opened her eyes to voice, did not
follow commands, localized briskly in the left upper
extremity, withdraw of right upper and the lower extremities.
Sputum cultures from 2011-06-04 00:00:00 were negative.  Urine was
negative.

She had a repeat head CT on 2011-06-04 00:00:00 which was stable.  We
continued to await culture results.  She was continued on
levofloxacin prophylactically.

On 2011-06-04 00:00:00 the patient opened her eyes to stimulation,
localized on the left, grimaced to pain, pupils were 3 down
to 2.5.  She did track the examiner.  She withdrew the left
side to pain.  She did not follow commands, withdrew on the
right side to pain as well.  The left upper was moving
spontaneously.

She was transferred to the regular floor on 2011-06-04 00:00:00.  She
was extubated on 2011-06-04 00:00:00.  She was transferred to the floor
on 2011-06-04 00:00:00.  Neurologically she has remained awake, somewhat
attentive, moving the left side spontaneously, and purposely,
the right upper extremity still withdrew to pain as well as
the right lower extremity.  She did attempt to track.  She
had a PEG feeding tube put in on 2011-06-04 00:00:00 without
complication.  She was evaluated by cardiology for persistent
atrial fibrillation and rapid atrial fibrillation.  She is
currently receiving amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. for two
weeks then down to 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two weeks and then
down to 200 mg p.o. q.d.  Her metoprolol was decreased to 100
mg p.o. b.i.d. and the verapamil she was on was discontinued.
She did convert to sinus rhythm and has remained in sinus
rhythm with stable blood pressures, and she has been afebrile
since coming out of the intensive care unit.
