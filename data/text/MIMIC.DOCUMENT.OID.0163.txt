CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cough/shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Clyne is a 60-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for hypertension,
times two, who developed a dry cough in late 2012-11-24 00:00:00 while
fly fishing in 123 Any St..  The cough persisted and he was given
erythromycin times ten days times two courses by his primary
care physician, Clyne. Clyne.  The erythromycin did not improve
the patient's symptoms.

The patient describes the cough as dry, not worse at night,
breath.  He denied fevers and  chills.  He states that he
lost about six pounds over the past two months intentionally.
Over the past one to two weeks, however, he has noted
increasing dyspnea with stairs, as well as fatigue.  On the
day prior to admission, he started a Z pack.

At his primary care physician's office today, he had a chest
x-ray which disclosed an enlarged heart and interstitial
infiltrates.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, as well
as an echocardiogram which disclosed evidence of a
pericardial effusion with tamponade.

There was diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right
ventricle.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department
at UPMCE for evaluation of the
pericardial effusion and drainage.  His pulses paradoxes was
18.  The echocardiogram performed in the Emergency Department
was consistent with cardiac tamponade.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable.

Note:  This physical examination was done after the patient
underwent his cardiac catheterization.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.3,
hematocrit of 41, platelet count of 294,000.  PT 13, PTT
23.6, INR 1.1.  Echocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm, 71
beats per minute, electrical alternans, low voltage
precordial leads, prolonged PR.  After the procedure,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a sinus rhythm at 82 beats
per minute, normal axis, prolonged PR, T wave inversions I
and aVL, biphasic T in V2, Qs in V1 to V2, increased voltage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted initially to the
Coronary Care Unit.  He underwent a cardiac catheterization
on 2012-11-24 00:00:00 for pericardiocentesis.  Hemodynamics showed
elevated and equal RA and pericardial pressures, 11-12 mm
mercury, slightly lower than pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure.  There was preserved cardiac index.  There is
preserved blood pressure with 15-20 mm mercury pulses
paradoxes.  During the pericardiocentesis, 1116 ml of
serosanguinous fluid was easily removed. Fluid was sent to
the laboratory for analysis.

Following the pericardiocentesis, the patient was admitted to
the Coronary Care Unit for further management.  On 2012-11-24 00:00:00, the pericardial drain was removed.  Repeat echocardiogram
did not disclose recurrence of the pericardial effusion.
Patient underwent CT of the chest which disclosed diffuse
interstitial infiltrates consistent with lymphangitic spread.
There was also a positive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and
lytic sclerotic bone lesions.

On 2012-11-24 00:00:00, the patient was transferred to the 123 Any St.
Service.  On the night of the 16th, he was tachycardic to the
160s.  Echocardiogram disclosed atrial flutter.  His blood
pressure was stable.  He was started on sotalol 120 mg b.i.d.
The following day this was decreased to 80 mg b.i.d.  While
on sotalol, his QTC interval was monitored and his potassium
was kept between 4.5 and 5.2.  Repeat echocardiogram did not
disclose re-accumulation of the pericardial effusion.

While on the [**Location (un) **] Service.  A Pulmonary Consult was
obtained for further evaluation of the diffuse infiltrates
seen on the CT.  Pulmonary Service recommended awaiting the
final pathology from the pericardial fluid.  They were
willing to perform transbronchial biopsy if necessary.

Patient was also seen by his Oncologist, Dr. Clyne.  Patient
underwent an MRI of his brain on 2012-11-24 00:00:00.  MRI disclosed
foci on the surface of the brain that appeared consistent
with leptomeningeal spread of cancer.  An abdominal CT was
done on 2012-11-24 00:00:00.  CT of the abdomen disclosed one
lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease throughout the
lungs was stable since the study one week before.  There was
an increase in the pericardial fluid since the study one week
prior.  There was interval development of multiple sclerotic
and lytic lesions within the osseous structures since 2012-11-24 00:00:00.
There were stable hepatic lesions that likely represent
simple cysts. There was a stable s123 Any St. lesion that likely
represents a hemangioma.  Although, colon appeared grossly
normal, radiologist's caution that the study was not
diagnostic for colon cancer.

Finally, pathology results from pericardial fluid were
obtained.  Pathologists performed multiple stains to identify
the type of cancer, the types of cells in the pericardial
fluid.  Pathologist's concluded that the malignant cells were
from adenocarcinoma.  The tumor cells are positive for CK7
and TTF1 markers.  TTF1 marker is specific for lung and
thyroid.  The cells were focally positive for CK20.
Pathologist's concluded that this immunoprofile is consistent
with an adenocarcinoma arising in the lung.

The patient was discharged on 2012-11-24 00:00:00.  He will have
outpatient work-up of his malignancy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient discharged home on Monday,
2012-11-24 00:00:00.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with his Oncologist,
Dr. Clyne, at 2 p.m.  He will be seen by Dr. Clyne in the
Brain Tumor Clinic at 4 p.m. on 2012-11-24 00:00:00.  He will
follow-up with his Cardiologist, Dr. Charlese Bahry, on Wednesday,
2012-11-24 00:00:00.  He was encouraged to call his primary
care physician for Charlese Bahry Clyne appointment.  Patient was
given Charlese Bahry Clyne of Heart's monitor so that his QTC interval
could be monitored for an additional week while on sotalol.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade.
2.  Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
3.  Hypertension.
4. Atrial Fibrillation.
