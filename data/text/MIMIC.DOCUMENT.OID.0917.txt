HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Mcilvain is a 77 year old,
Russian-speaking man with known coronary artery disease, with
a one year history of worsening chest pain, now with unstable
angina, scheduled for cardiac catheterization in 2007-03-03 00:00:00, after a positive stress test.  The patient elected to
postpone the procedure at that time.  The patient presented
to the Emergency Room on 2007-03-03 00:00:00 with a complaint of chest pain
and shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus type
II; dementia; benign prostatic hypertrophy; hypertension;
osteoarthritis; chronic back and knee pain.

11. Lorazepam.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, the patient was treated by
the medical service and ruled out for a myocardial
infarction, ultimately being seen by cardiology and
undergoing cardiac catheterization, which revealed 70%
proximal left anterior descending; 70% mid left anterior
descending; 90% distal left anterior descending; 90% D-1; 60%
obtuse marginal one; 90% obtuse marginal two; and 100% right
coronary artery lesions.  The patient's MIBI from 2007-03-03 00:00:00 showed an ejection fraction of 58% with global left
ventricular wall motion abnormalities and moderate to severe
inferior wall reversible defect.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an ex-smoker and denies
alcohol use.  He lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 98.1; blood pressure 90
to 170 over 65 to 80; heart rate of 52 to 66; respiratory
rate of 18; oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.  General:
The patient is comfortable, in no acute distress.  HEAD,
EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Anicteric.  Mucous
membranes moist. No jugular venous distention.  Chest:
Occasional crackles, otherwise clear.  Cardiac:  Distant
heart sounds; regular rate and rhythm; S1 and S2.  Abdomen is
obese, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are warm
and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologic:  Alert and grossly nonfocal examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 7.7; hematocrit of 36.4;
platelets 235.  PT of 12.1; PTT 27.2; INR of 1.0.  Sodium of
136; potassium of 4.3; chloride of 99; C02 of 27; BUN 20;
creatinine 1.2; glucose 294.  CK of 39 at the time of
admission.

Following cardiac catheterization, the patient was seen by
the CT surgery service, who noted a pericardial mass, likely
a thymoma versus a pericardial cyst.  Neurologic, psychiatric
and thoracic surgery services were consulted as well as the
patient was noted to have some preoperative dementia.
Ultimately on 2007-03-03 00:00:00, the patient was brought to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting.  Please see the operating room report for full
details.  In summary, the patient had a coronary artery
bypass graft times four with the left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending; saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal; saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal one and
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.
His bypass time was 86 minutes with a cross clamp time of 51
minutes.  In addition, the patient had removal of a
pericardial mass at that time.  He tolerated the procedure as
well and was transferred from the operating room to the
cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient had a heart rate of 88 that was A-paced.  He had
a mean arterial pressure of 98 with a CVP of 5.  He had a
Levophed infusion as well as a Propofol infusion. The patient
did well in the immediate postoperative period.  His
anesthesia was reversed. Hew as weaned from the ventilator
and extubated; however, upon extubation, the patient was
noted to have severe stridor and was, therefore, reintubated.
The patient remained intubated and ventilated throughout the
night of his surgery following the reintubation. During that
period, he did have several episodes of ventricular
tachycardia and Amiodarone infusion was started at that time
and he maintained adequate hemodynamics with the Levophed
infusion as well.

On postoperative day number one, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  The sedation was again stopped and
he was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated
without complication.  Following extubation, the patient was
also weaned from his Levophed infusion as well as his
Amiodarone infusion and he was started on oral betablockade.
Additionally, the patient's chest tubes were removed. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the day of
postoperative day number two.

On postoperative day number three, the patient had been
transitioned to all oral medications.  He was in normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 74 with a blood pressure of 110/55;
respiratory rate of 20 with oxygen saturation of 100% on two
liters.  His temporary pacing wires were discontinued and he
was transferred to 2007-03-03 00:00:00 for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Once on the floor, the patient had
an uneventful postoperative course.  His activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapy.  He remained hemodynamically stable
throughout his hospitalization, without any further evidence
of ventricular tachycardia.  He continued to be seen in
consultation by the electrophysiology service as well as the
neurology service and, on postoperative day number six, it
was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be
discharged to home.

At the time of the patient's discharge, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Temperature 98.3; pulse
57 and sinus rhythm; blood pressure 120/70; respiratory rate
of 20; oxygen saturation 94% on room air.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 6.1; hematocrit of 25;
platelets of 213; sodium of 139; potassium of 4.0; chloride
102; C02 28; BUN 17; creatinine 1.1; glucose of 212.
Magnesium of 1.8.

The patient was in no acute distress.  His lung examination
is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac examination is
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities are warm and well perfused.  His sternum is
stable.  Incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and
dry.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets every four hours prn.
3.  Glipizide 10 mg twice a day.
4.  Hytrin 5 mg twice a day.
5.  Glucophage 1000 mg twice a day.
6.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day.
7.  Lasix 20 mg twice a day times seven days.
8.  Potassium chloride 20 meq twice a day times seven days.
9.  Ecotrin 325 mg q. day.
10. Protonix 40 mg q. day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times with a left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending.  Saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal.  Saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Dementia.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Depression.

The patient is to be discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

He is to have follow-up with Dr. Algene Bordogna in one to two weeks
and follow-up with Dr. Mcilvain in six weeks.
