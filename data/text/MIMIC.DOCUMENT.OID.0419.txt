2006-02-02 00:00:00 Maxillofacial CT: There is a minimally displaced obliquely
oriented fracture extending along the right temporal bone which
extends into the right sphenoid bone, to involve the right
pterygomaxillary fossa. There is an associated nondisplaced
fracture involving the right zygomatic arch and right orbital
wall of the zygomatic bone. High-density material consistent
with hemorrhage is noted within the sphenoid sinus. There is a
subtle associated transversely oriented lucency most consistent
with a nondisplaced fracture along the roof of the sphenoid
sinus at the level of the orbital apex and optic canals. The
globes, extraocular eye muscles and optic nerves otherwise
appear intact. The paranasal sinuses are otherwise well
pneumatized aside from minor mucosal thickening within the right
maxillary antrum. There is again demonstrated a small amount of
pneumocephalus along the inner table of the squamous portion of
the left temporal bone. A definite fracture is not identified in
this location. Note is made of several opacified left mastoid
air cells without fracture ap123 Any St.ted in this location.

2006-02-02 00:00:00 CT Head: 1. Bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhagic
contusions, most pronounced in the left inferior temporal lobe.
2. Small amount of likely subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
interpeduncular
cistern and high within the left frontal lobe.
3. Multiple fractures including the squamous portions of the
temporal bones bilaterally, roof of the sphenoid sinus, right
sphenoid, right lateral orbital wall and right zygomatic arch.
4. Pneumocephalus within the middle left cranial fossa which
raises possiblility of occult adjacent fracture.

2006-02-02 00:00:00 CT Neck: 1. No evidence for cervical spine fracture or
malalignment.
 2. For additional details regarding the skull base fractures
and intracranial hemorrhage, please refer to the accompanying CT
of the head and facial bones.

right zymogatic and sphenoid fractures in the skull as well as a
a small subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was admitted to the
intensive care unit and monitored from a neurologic standpoint.
Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended starting the patient
on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. Plastic surgery service was
consulted and planned to repair her facial fractures on an
outpatient basis. She had a normal neurologic exam throughout
