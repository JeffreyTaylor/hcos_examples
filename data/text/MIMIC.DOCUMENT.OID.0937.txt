Radiology:
Initial CT head 2006-08-28 00:00:00
Left frontoparietal extra-axial hematoma extending along the
falx

centrally of the hemorrhage suggests an epidural source, the
location (crossing the coronal suture) cofnirms subdural
localization. Stable midline shift to the right by about 6 mm.
No fracture.

No fracture or abnormal alignment

2. Marked reduction in rightward shift of normally midline
structures, as

3. No new intracranial hemorrhage or acute large vascular

1. Since 2006-08-28 00:00:00, slight re-accumulation of left
subdural blood, with maximal depth of 5 mm, and little mass
effect.
2. Slight, 2mm rightward shift and mild left cerebral

unchanged.
3. No central herniation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to UPMCE from an OSH as a trasnfer for
Subdural hematoma. he was emergently evaluated in the emergency
room and imaging was reviewed. It was felt that emergent
intervention via left craniotomy for evacuation of the subdural
hematoma was warranted. He was taken to the operating room for
evacuation of the blood and a subgaleal [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1642**] Orloff Drain was
placed. He tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the
operating room, and transferred to the ICU post-operatively for
management and observation. His JP drain was placed to bulb
suction and he remained stable overnight in the ICU. On the
morning of 2006-08-28 00:00:00 he was stable and his pain was well controlled.
His JP drain was deemed fit for removal at 1200 on 2006-08-28 00:00:00 and it
was removed without incident and 3 staples were placed over the
exit site. He was transitioned to the floor on 2006-08-28 00:00:00 and
there were no issues post ICU transfer. He was transitioned from
phenyton to levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis (he did not
have a seizure during his stay) and this will be continued until
he is assessed in 4 weeks.

He was assessed by PT and OT who deemed him safe for discharge
on 2006-08-28 00:00:00. He will schadule follow-up with Dr Ildefonso Zydek with
repeat CT head in 4 weeks. He will also schedule Dalayah
Neurology follow-up with Dr Dalayah. He has been advised to
have a wound check and staple removal at his PCP's office in
2006-08-28 00:00:00 days from date of surgery and will make an appointment to
see his PCP as soon as possible post discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3811**] Orloff Dalayah Orloff. You presented to hospital
after sustaining a head injury whilst playing football but did
not lose consciousness and were found to have a collection of
bood around your brain called a SUBDURAL HEMATOMA. Given the
size of this bleeding which is due to rupture of veins on the
surface of the brain, you went on to have an operation so that
the resultant blood clot could be removed. The operation was
succsessful and you did well following your operation. You were
started on pain killers and anti-seizure medications given a
risk of seizures following irritation of the brain following
your injury. You HAVE NOT had a seziure and DO NOT have epilepsy
and hence there are no driving restrictions for this. After
evaluation by pysical therapy and occupational therapy, were
deemed fit for discharge. You should make an appointment to see
Dr Dalayah in 4 weeks and we will evaluate you with a repeat CT
scan at this time. Further follow-up will be organised as
appropriate depending on the scan results and how you are doing
clinically. Sometimes patients can have some memory problems and
issues with concentration following head injuries (although you
have the benefit of not having lost consciousness at the time)
and you should therefore follow-up as below with Dr Dalayah
who is a Dalayah Neurologist who will assess memory,
concentration and other areas of brain function following your
head injury. You should see your PCP as soon as possible
following discharge.

Medication changes:
We STARTED Keppra 750mg twice daily which you should take until
follow-up with neurosurgery at which point the need for
continuation of this will be addressed
We STARTED laxatives
We STARTED Fioricet 1-2 tabs as needed and this should be taken
first as a pain killer for headaches. Eventually this can be
weaned to regular Tylenol.
We STARTED oxycodone 5-10mg as needed every 4 hours for pain.
This should be taken sparingly and only if Fioriccet is not
effective. This can be sedating so be cautious of this.

Patient instructions:
NO CONTACT SPORTS FOR A MINIMUM OF 6 MONTHS
??????	Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for
signs of infection.
??????	Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,
or excessive bending.
??????	You may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have
been removed. If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures,
you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
??????	You may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover
your head.
??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace)
while taking narcotic pain medication.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc.
??????	You have been prescribed Keppra for anti-seizure medicine,
take it as prescribed. You will not require blood work
monitoring for this medication.
??????	Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at
your post-operative office visit.

CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE
FOLLOWING

??????	New onset of tremors or seizures.
??????	Any confusion or change in mental status.
??????	Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
??????	Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not
relieved by pain medication.
??????	Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling,
tenderness, or drainage.
??????	Fever greater than or equal to 101?????? F.

Followup Instructions:
Orloff make an appointment to see your PCP as soon as possible
following discharge.

??????Please make an appointment to have your staples removed at your
PCP Orloff 2006-08-28 00:00:00 days (from your date of surgery) and a wound check.
??????Please call (test@mail.com to schedule an appointment with Dr.
Dalayah, to be seen in 4 weeks.
??????You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast at that
time.  You can schedule this when making your appointment with
Dr. Dalayah.
