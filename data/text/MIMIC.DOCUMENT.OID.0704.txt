ECG:  Sinus tachycardia, Modest right ventricular conduction
delay pattern
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with right precordial lead
downslying ST
segment elevation - consider acute injury/ischemia or possible
"Brugada-type ECG" pattern Clinical correlation is suggested
Since 123 Any St.us tracing of 2008-12-16 00:00:00, sinus tachycardia and diffuse
ST-T wave abnormalities present

TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta  is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
In ED:

Patient was intubated for airway protection, as she was
unresponsive
secondary to overdose.

Overdose:

 she was given charcoal by NG and toxicology
was consulted.  She was also given dantrolene due to concern for

NMS.

rhabdomyolysis:

managed with IVF hydration and alkalinization of the urine.  She

did have acute renal failure, but FeNa was most consistent with
pre-renal
azotemia, likely secondary to hypotension.

increased anion gap acidosis:

this was likely secondary to both lactic acidosis and uremic
acidosis. Also
had acute respiratory acidosis secondary to hypoventilation.
The metabolic acidosis resolved with hydration, and the
respiratory acidosis resolved after mechanical ventilation.

acute renal failure:

Concern for ATN with rhabdomyolysis, but FeNa consistent
with pre-renal azotemia, secondary to hypotension. This
trended downward with IVF hydration. Potential
rhabdomyolysis was managed with aggressive ivf hydration
with alkalinization of the urine.

ID:

empirically started on levaquin/flagyl in ED with
fever and hypotension.  Not continued in ICU; follow up
cultures.

Spiked to 102.2 on 2008-12-16 00:00:00.  Cultures sent, CXR with no
frank infiltrate, and central line removed with cath tip sent
for
culture.  No empiric antibiotics started - awaiting culture
data.

CV:

Presented with new 2mm ST depression in 2,3,avF as
well as lateral pre-cordial leads.  This was likely
a rate-related ischemia as she was tachycardic in the 140's on
presentation.  These ST depressions trended back
to baseline with rate decreasing.  She did have positive
troponins; felt to be demand ischemia. The EKG changes
resolved, and cardiac enzymes trended down.
