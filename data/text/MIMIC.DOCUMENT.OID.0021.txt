Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right
pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Year/Month/Day 278**] placement and
antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from UPMCE rehab
with diarrhea, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. No
source of infection had been identified so far. He was C-diff
negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism.
He was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and
metronidazole for 7 days. His blood pressure responded to fluid
challenge and he has been normotensive since then. He was
started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. He was
gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.

His blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding
scale. He was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. Plastic
surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not
necessary. Therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing,
Kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. He remiained in
normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial
fibrillation.

He was very agitated in the ICU. He was weaned off fentanyl drip
and put on fentanyl patch. He also was put on standing zyprexa
and prn haldol, morphine. He was also on standing valium and was
actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims
that he was on valium at home.He is full code and his health
