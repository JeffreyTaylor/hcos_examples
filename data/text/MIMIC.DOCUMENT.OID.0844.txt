History of Present Illness:
This 62 year old patient with 123 Any St.us coronary artery bypass
grafting in 2010-04-05 00:00:00 presented at this time with symptoms of chest
pain and dyspnea on exertion.  He was investigated and was found
to have residual disease in the obtuse marginal graft and also
severe aortic stenosis and mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.  He had no viable leg veins to be used as
conduits and hence preoperatively, the obtuse marginal vein
graft was stented successfully and he was electively admitted
for aortic valve replacement with or without mitral valve repair
or replacement.

2010-04-05 00:00:00 EKG
Probable sinus but possibly ectopic atrial tachycardia. Since
the 123 Any St.us
tracing of 2010-04-05 00:00:00 the rate has increased and pacing is no
longer seen. The rapid is accompanied by inferolateral ischemic
ST-T wave abnormalities.

2010-04-05 00:00:00 CXR
The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve
replacement as well as coronary artery bypass surgery. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable compared to the
123 Any St.us postoperative radiographs. There has been interval
resolution of bibasilar atelectasis. The right hemidiaphragm has
an unusual tenting at its mid portion, likely due to mild right
upper lobe volume loss as the minor fissure is also slightly
elevated. A small amount of pleural fluid in the subpulmonic
space could also produce this appearance of the diaphragm.
Healed rib fractures on the left are incidentally noted as well
as coronary artery stents.

2010-04-05 00:00:00 ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1.The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrial appendage
emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial
appendage.
2.The right atrium is markedly dilated. A patent foramen ovale
is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest.
3.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and septal
basal and mid moderate hypokinesis. .
4.There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate (2010-04-05 00:00:00+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate (2010-04-05 00:00:00+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
Moderately depressed LV systolic function. Moderate RV free wall
hypokinesis which improved gradually with inotropic support.
Mechanical valve in aortic position/wellseated with good leaflet
excursion, trace AI. Mitral regurgitation is of mild intensity
now.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Mcintyre was admitted to the UPMCE on 2010-04-05 00:00:00 for elective
surgical management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent a
redosternotomy with an aortic valve replacement using a 21mm St.
Abshir Mcintyre mechanical Regeant valve. Postoperatively he was taken to
the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. Mcintyre Mcintyre neurologically intact
and was extubated. Aspirn, plavix, beta blockade and a statin
were resumed. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for his
mechanical aortic valve. He developed atrial fibrillation for
which amiodarone was started with conversion to normal sinus
rhythm. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the
cardiac surgical nursing floor for further recovery. Mr. Mcintyre
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. A psychiatry consult was
obtained for some postoperative confusion and crying episodes.
Fluoxetine was continued and frequent family/staf reorientation
was encouraged. One month follow-up was recommended. Mr. Mcintyre
developed sternal drainage and vancomycin and levaquin was
started. Vancomycin was discontinued on 2010-04-05 00:00:00, he has remained
afebrile with a normal WBC.  His sternal drainage has subsided,
and he is ready to be discharged today.  He will follow-up here
next week for a wound check.
