HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. Jerelly Dimmer is a
79-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who
presents from Shore House Rehabilitation following episodes
of tachypnea, hypoxemia and obtundation requiring
endotracheal intubation.  The patient is status post recent
hospitalization from 2011-09-15 00:00:00 to 2011-09-15 00:00:00 for gallstone
pancreatitis requiring open cholecystectomy and
choledochoduodenostomy on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 by Dr. Dimmer with
hospitalization complicated by E. coli sepsis, volume
overload and bilateral pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation
and postop abdominal abscess which grew out Vancomycin
Resistant Enterococcus.

The patient subsequently had a gallbladder drainage by CT
guidance on 2011-09-15 00:00:00.  The patient suffered C. diff colitis at
prior hospitalization.  Towards the end of hospitalization
was noted to have acute tachypnea.  She was subsequently
discharged to Shore House on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 on antibiotics
Linezolide for four week course for her Vancomycin resistant
enterococcus abscess and Flagyl for 14 day course for C. diff
colitis.

At the Shore House however, the patient was doing poorly with
continued lethargy, anorexia and depression.  The patient was
noted to develop hyponatremia.  She apparently developed
cough on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 for which she was treated with Robitussin and
the day prior to admission was noted to have hypoxemia with
O2 saturations 90% on two liters nasal cannula.

On the morning of presentation to UPMCE the patient shortly was noted to become more
tachypneic and somnolent with oxygen saturation in the 60's
and requiring 100% non-rebreather.  The patient subsequently
then became unresponsive and was subsequently started manual
artificial respirations and was sent to UPMCE for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Room she was afebrile, heart rate in the 80s
and blood pressure 140/80, oxygen saturation 90% on 100%
non-rebreather, unresponsive.  The patient subsequently
intubated at the Emergency Room at UPMCE.  She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
for further treatment.

right middle ear.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  The patient was subsequently admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
She is a 79-year-old person with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure
presents from rehabilitation on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 following episode of
tachypnea, hypoxia, obtundation requiring intubation with
presumed sepsis.  The patient is status post recent
hospitalization 2011-09-15 00:00:00 to 2011-09-15 00:00:00 for gallstone pancreatitis
requiring open cholecystectomy and choledochoduodenostomy
with hospitalization complicated by sepsis, volume overload
and bilateral effusions, atrial fibrillation, C. diff colitis
and postoperative intra-abdominal abscess at the
port-a-hepatis requiring CT guidance drainage and extended
therapeutic use of Linezolid.  The patient had one episode of
unexplained respiratory decompensation at hospitalization
characterized by respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.  She had
a negative CT angio of the chest and episode resolved on its
own after treatment with high flow oxygen.  The patient had
been failing to thrive at rehabilitation with poor p.o.
intake, unable to fully participate in rehabilitation
activities.

THE patient presented on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 in ventilatory failure and
hypertension requiring volume resuscitation and temple
posterior support.  Sputum grew out Klebsiella and urine grew
out pseudomonas.  All blood cultures were surprisingly
negative.  The initial impression was that the patient may
have aspirated however, further workup revealed a
questionable myopathy and we suspected she is unable to
effectively clear her secretions.  She has since undergone a
complicated tracheostomy requiring tracheal repair and open
sternotomy.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM AND PLAN:
1.  Pulmonary.  Infectious disease.  The patient initially
presented with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, respiratory failure
requiring intubation.  The patient originally spiked to 102.8
and developed leukocytosis to 37,000.  Chest x-ray showed
bilateral moderate effusions with ill defined opacification
in the right lung.  CT angio of the chest revealed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism, scattered ground glass
opacity, emphysematous changes and moderate bilateral
effusions, slightly increased since last hospitalization.
She also demonstrated a large substernal goiter which was
unchanged.  She was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics
initially with Ceftazidime, Flagyl as well as Linazolid which
she has been scheduled to be on through mid-2011-09-15 00:00:00 for
intra-abdominal Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus abscess.
Her left sided effusion was subsequently tapped by
interventional pulmonology which removed 700 cc's of fluid on
2011-09-15 00:00:00 which was transudative and sterile.  All blood cultures
proved negative.  Her sputum did show Klebsiella with urine
showing pseudomonas.  Her antibiotic therapy was changed to
Zosyn, Piperacillin, Bactrim for which she received a 7 day
course.  The patient was weaned off chemical process on 2011-09-15 00:00:00,
extubated on 2011-09-15 00:00:00.  She initially did well though developed
sudden acute hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, apnea and
generalized unresponsiveness requiring emergent re-intubation
on 2011-09-15 00:00:00.  This occurred while receiving a bath.  The
feeling is that she had an underlying questionable myopathic
process which caused the patient to be unable to clear her
secretions.

The patient improved rapidly following re-intubation with
excellent oxygenation though required chemical process
transiently, Levophed.

On 2011-09-15 00:00:00 the patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy,
which was complicated by tear of the posterior trachea.  She
was taken emergently to the operating room and required open
sternotomy.  She had a large substernal goiter making her
airway tortuous.  Bilateral thoracostomy tubes were placed
which were eventually discontinued on 2011-09-15 00:00:00.  She
had a mediastinal tube with drainage, was subsequently
discontinued several days afterwards.  During that period she
required daily bronchoscopies to check placement of the
endotracheal tube for suctioning.  She was allowed to have a
mild cuff leak so as not to produce tension on the suture
line.  On 2011-09-15 00:00:00 the patient underwent a tracheostomy change
to a Bivoner tracheostomy flexible trach with a foam cuff.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient
currently is being weaned off vents.  The patient is
currently requiring assist control 500, tidal volume,
respiratory rate of 12, FIO2 of 0.4% and PEEP of 5 at night
time.  During the day the patient is able to tolerate
pressure support of 8 and PEEP of 5 with FIO2 of 0.4% for
extended periods of time.

The patient was given multiple trials of pressure support.
however, the longest that the patient is able to tolerate
pressure support was approximately 36 hours before she
subsequently had respiratory decompensation including low
tidal volumes and decreased oxygen saturation.  Ever since
the tracheostomy changed to the Bivoner valve the patient is
unable to tolerate trach mask trial.  It is thought that the
patient's respiratory failure to wean may be secondary to a
myopathic process.  Will be discussed later in Neurological
component of this dictation.

The patient will benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation for
vent weaning.  Ultimately once the patient is tolerating more
pressure support on her Bivoner valve the patient will be
changed over to Shiley which is fenestrated tracheostomy in
transition to removal of trach.  This trach change will be
performed by Dr. Charis Brawand Jerelly Dimmer at a later date.  Dr. Jerelly
telephone number is test@mail.com.  Arrangements should be
made once the patient is able to tolerate pressure support
for extended periods of time.  No passine valve should be
placed on the Bivoner valve as her cuff is a foam cuff and
does not display completely.

2.  Cardiovascular.  The patient has a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation since her last hospitalization.  She has
been on Amiodarone which has since subsequently discontinued
given a question of contributing to her myopathy.  She has
required DC cardioversion for atrial fibrillation shortly
after her initial presentation at UPMCE though subsequently reverted to constant
atrial fibrillation.  She is currently being rate controlled
with Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.  She had an echo in Late
2011-09-15 00:00:00 which showed basilar septal left ventricular
hypertrophy, ejection fraction of greater than 55%  2+ MR, 2+
TR, moderate pulmonary hypertension.  She was also given a
trial of low dose Captopril however, her blood pressures
subsequently were to low systolically, 80's to 90's systolic
so Captopril was subsequently discontinued.  She required
persistent diuresis with Lasix however, with aggressive
diuresis the patient's bicarbonate increased to 40 and she
developed contraction alkalosis and relatively oliguria.

The patient was subsequently rebolused with intravenous
fluids and her urine output improved and contraction
alkalosis subsequently resolved.  The patient's urine output
subsequently began to pick up, 50 cc's an hour without
aggressive Lasix diuretic treatment.

3.  Renal. Her BUN and creatinine has remained stable
throughout her hospitalization.  Her 24 hour urine estimates
for creatinine clearance approximately 50 to 60.  In regards
to urine output the patient was aggressively diuresed during
hospital course however, subsequently became intravascularly
dry and her urine output subsequently dropped to 5 to 10 cc's
an hour which responded to intravenous fluid boluses.   It is
thought the patient would start to mobilize her extravascular
space once her nutritional status improved.  The patient may
tolerate gentle diuresis at this point however, will run the
risk of volume contraction alkalosis and intravascular
de123 Any St.n and anuria requiring further intravenous fluid
boluses and further worsening of her anasarca.

4.  Neurology.  The patient was originally evaluated by
Neurology, felt to have a myopathy with possible muscle
weakness. The patient had a negative Tensilon test.  An EEG
was also consistent with mild pathic process, MR to severe
axonal polyneuropathy was also noted.  It is unclear what is
the cause of her myopathy.  Differential includes critical
care myopathy versus dry induced myopathy.   Potential
offenders include Amiodarone and Lanazolide.  She also had
normal CK laboratory test.  Her thyroid and renal functions
have been measured and are normal.

Originally there was a planned biopsy by Neurosurgery during
the trach change in the operating room however, the biopsy of
the muscle was not performed as Dr. Charis Brawand was unavailable
for the muscle biopsy.  However, given her recurrent status
will defer muscle biopsy to a later date.   Her prognosis is
unclear at this point.  It is unclear whether or not the
patient will benefit from steroids.

5.  Gastrointestinal.  The patient has a history of lower
gastrointestinal bleed with bright red blood per rectum
during her last hospitalization which was a negative
colonoscopy.  She has been occult blood negative for most
part during hospitalization.  She did screens which have been
negative.  However, the most recent C. diff colitis screen
was positive for C. diff colitis.  The patient was started on
Metronidazole per percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
for treatment, complete a 14 day course.  She had an
abdominal CT without contrast done earlier in the hospital
which showed basically resolution of her former abdominal
abscess.  Her Linazolide was discontinued on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 with
Infectious Disease's recommendations.  She currently has a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed and was
receiving tube feeds and most of her medications through the
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

6.  Genitourinary.  The patient had multiple numerous urinary
tract infections with bacteria and yeast and on 2011-09-15 00:00:00 Foley
was subsequently changed.  The patient received two days of
Levofloxacin discontinued following development of a fine
erythematous rash involving upper chest, back and thighs.
The patient subsequently development of a urinary tract
infection is being treated with Bactrim DS tablets p.o.
b.i.d., will complete a 7 day course.  The patient has
subsequently had multiple yeast infections as well treated
with Diflucan and Foley changes.

7.  Heme.  The patient developed thrombocytopenia with a drop
in her platelets down to 100,000 during earlier part of her
hospitalization the etiology was unclear.  It is thought to
be drug related verses thrombocytopenia with sepsis.  Her
Thrombocytopenia has subsequently resolved.  She has required
intermittent transfusions of packed red blood cells during
hospitalization without clear source of bleeding.  The
patient may have anemia of chronic disease at this point.
During the later part of her hospitalization the patient's
hematocrit has subsequently stable around 30.  The patient
has been on Heparin during a portion of her hospitalization
for catheter related thrombosis of the right anterior
jugular, partial non-occlusive clot.  The line was
subsequently discontinued and was started on Heparin for
earlier part of her hospitalization and subsequently held
prior to her procedures of tracheostomy.  Heparin was
restarted during the later part of her hospital course and
Coumadin was subsequently started.  INR should be checked and
Heparin should be discontinued once her INR is greater than
2.0.  Goal INR is greater than 2, less than 3.0.  The patient
tolerating Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q h.s.

8.  Endocrine.  The patient was maintained on Synthroid
throughout her entire hospital course.  Random Cortisol
during her hospital course revealed measurement of 20, the
patient was not adrenal insufficient.  The patient's
hypothyroidism was subsequently treated with hormone
replacement.

9.  FEN.  The patient had unexplained hyponatremia as an
outpatient at the rehabilitation and upon presentation at
UPMCE questionable whether or
not the patient has inappropriate NIDH also, responded with
intravenous fluid resuscitation.  The hyponatremia
subsequently resolved.  The patient was briefly on total
parenteral nutrition around the time of her tracheal repair.
The patient was subsequently tolerating tube feeds and
subsequently had percutaneous gastrostomy tube placed and
performed by Interventional Radiology and has been receiving
tube feeds Promod without fiber and subsequently been doing
well.  Currently at goal of 70 cc's per hour.  During her
entire hospital course the patient had episodes of
hypocalcemia, hypokalemia which was subsequently repleted and
with resolution.  The patient received approximately 250 cc's
of free water boluses through her percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube b.i.d.

10.  Prophylaxis.  The patient currently on Pneumo boots, on
Heparin GGT and is in the process of transition to Coumadin.
The patient receives Prevacid through her percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
