History of Present Illness:
Ms. Naro is an 86 year old female with multiple medical
problems including bilateral unprovoked PE's on coumadin, CAD,
diabetes on home insulin complicated by LE ulcers who was
initially referreed into the ER by her VNA for hyperglycemia.
She has been being seen every other day by a VNA for wound care
of her lower extremity ulcers, which per her report have been
improving and this morning she was noted to have a blood sugar
of 411.  She says that she took her usual insulin regimen this
morning which is 6units of NPH and 20 units of regular.
Additionally, she completed an empiric 10 day course of
ciprofloxacin 4 days ago which was prescribed by her podiatrist
for her lower extremity ulcers, however the dysuria she had been
having improved but did not resolve.  She says that at baseline
she is incontinent, she continues to have dysuria but thinks
that her urine output has actually decreased recently.  She
thinks that her LE ulcers have been improving, she denies any
associated fever/chills, n/v/d, abdominal pain, leg pain, chest
pain or shortness of breath.

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.4, 57, 110/44, 16, 100% on RA.
She was initially alert and interactive but about 30min later,
she was found to be much less interactive and her labs returned
with a blood sugar of 39, she was then given 1 amp of D50 with
improvement in her mental status and repeat FS was 238.  At the
time of her hypoglycemia she was also noted to feel cool to the
touch, at which time a rectal temperature was done that was 35
degress celsius.  Other than the hypoglycemia her labs were
notable for a Cr of 2.9 from a baseline of 1.1-1.6, her INR was
6.0, lactate of 1.4, white count was 7.9, no bands, but 1 meta
and 1 myelo, U/A with 135 WBC's, many bacteria, trace blood and
30 protein.  X-rays of her LLE did not show any evidnece of
osteomyelitis, and CXR did not show any evidence of pnuemonia.
Additionally, in the ER she had an episode of hypotension to
78/35, which improved to SBP's in the 110's after 2LNS.  She was
given ceftriaxone for the UTI and vancomycin for possible
cellulitis surrounding her LE ulcers.  VS on transfer: rectal
temp of 34.3C, 55, 111/63, 17, 95% on RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, her initial VS were: 93.9, 69, 110/63,
16, 92% on RA.  She currently is denying any pain, her only
complaint is that she continues to feel cold.  She also says
that she has a chronic cough that is unchanged.

Studies:

Ankle film - IMPRESSION: No radiographic findings to suggest
acute osteomyelitis. Probable soft tissue defect overlying the
distal medial tibia. Extensive vascular calcifications.

CXR - IMPRESSION: 1. Flattening of the diaphragms suggests
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 2. Mild bibasilar
opacities may be due to atelectasis or mild aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Naro is an 86 year-old female with a complicated past
medical history who was admitted with hypotension.

Hospital Course
----------------
The patient presented to the ED due to fatigue and
hyperglycemia. In the ED, inital labs notable for Cr of 2.9 from
a baseline of 1.1-1.6, INR was 6.0, lactate of 1.4, white count
was 7.9, no bands, but 1 meta and 1 myelo, U/A with 135 WBC's,
many bacteria, trace blood and 30 protein. X-rays of her LLE did
not show any evidnece of osteomyelitis, and CXR did not show any
evidence of pnuemonia. Additionally, she had an episode of
hypotension to 78/35, which improved to SBP's in the 110's after
2LNS. She was given ceftriaxone for the UTI and vancomycin for
possible cellulitis surrounding her LE ulcers. Admitted to MICU.

.
In the MICU the patient was found to be HD stable and mentating
well. All anti-hypertensives were held. Blood sugars were
controlled on ISS alone. The patient had 1 episode of
hypotension overnight (75/40) which improved without
intervention. Otherwise maintained SBPs >90.
.
The patient was transferred to the medical floor on 2011-03-21 00:00:00.
She reported feeling greatly improved since admission and was
without new complaint. Her urine culutre returned with
contaminant only and, given lack of fevers or further
hypotension, all antibiotics were stopped. The patient was
maintained off lisinopril, atenolol, amlodipine, terazosin and
furosemide (all home medications) and was normotensive in-house.
The patient was discharged on 2011-03-21 00:00:00 with plans for close
outpatient follow-up.
.
#) Acute Renal Failure: On admission, the patient's creatinine
was 2.9. Her creatinine was 123 Any St.usly 1.6 in 2011-03-21 00:00:00 and ~1.1
prior. Her BUN was also elevated and labs showed a BUN:Cr of 28.
Appeared dry on initial exam. The patient's creatinine improved
over her hospital course with IVF alone. Her Cr was 1.5 on
discharge.
.
#) Prior pulmonary embolism on coumadin: INR on admission was
6.0. This was thought to be due to recent course of
ciprofloxacin (coumadin was not dose adjusted). The patient's
coumadin was initially held and her INR drifted down. Restarted
home dose of coumdadin on dsicharge.
.
#) CAD: Continued home simvastatin and ASA
.
#) Depression: Continued home citalopram and mirtazapine
.
#) Glaucoma: Continued her home cosopt and xalatan
.
#) Transitional Issues
All anti-hypertensives held on discharge. Can be restarted by
PCP/gerontology based on clinical assessment and pressures in
clinic.
