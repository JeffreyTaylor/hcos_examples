History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Faylynn F. Tun is a 82 year-old spanish and italian
speaking woman with DM2, asthma, AFib who presents with weakness
for the past week. She has been unable to stand or get out of
bed and has had generalized weakness.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 99, 103, 181/84, 16, 96%. Her
labs were significant for CK elevation to [**Numeric Identifier 2528**] without renal
failure. Her EKG was unchanged from prior. Neurology was
consulted given her weakness and felt this was likely related to
rhabdo. Patient received approximately 1 liter of NS in the ER
given CXR with concern for volume overload. Head CT showed small
(<4.5mm) L frontal area that was possibly SDH vs calcium. She
was admitted to medicine with vitals on transfer of 94, 155/66,
16, 98% RA.
.
On the floor, her son translates for her and says she feels ok.
She denies any pain, SOB, CP, palpitations. She is asking for
water.
.
ROS: Per son, patient frequently complains of having to urinate.
Denies headache, vision changes, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation.

Social History:
She is originally from 123 Any St. and then moved to 123 Any St., where
she lived most of her life. She has been in the US since 2009-04-04 00:00:00.
She denies any current or past history of smoking. Drinks
alcohol socially and has never used illicit drugs. She lives
with her husband, who is her primary care taker. She uses a
walker at baseline and requires a lot of help with her ADLs.

Brief Hospital Course:
UPMCE Floor course
Mrs.  Tun was a very nice 82 year-old spanish and italian
speaking woman with DM2, asthma, chronic  systolic heart failure
(EF 55%), HTN, paroxysmal Atiral Fibrilliation who initially
presented with rhabdo. which was complicated by altered mental
status, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure, she recieved
intavenous Bicarbonate and was placed on Amiodarone in the ICU
and was transferred back to the general wards ( on 2009-04-04 00:00:00) from
the ICU after her acute renal failure and atrial fibrilliation
was rate controlled.
.
#Positive Troponins/NSTEMI- On morning of 2009-04-04 00:00:00 the patient
complained of vague abdominal pain and EKG was carried out with
cardiac enxymes. Troponin was found to be positive at 1.2 with
CK index of 2.4. The patient's pain resolved with no
intervention and she was asymptomatic on morning rounds with the
only complaint of weakness. Her EKG was hard to assess for ST
changes given chronic left bundle branch block.Her vitals
remained stable and her troponin remained between 1.2-1.35.
Heparin drip was started on the morning of 2009-04-04 00:00:00 with full dose
aspirin with cardiology consult. On the morning of 2009-04-04 00:00:00 the
patient was in rate controlled atrial fibrilliation on standing
metoprolol and amiodarone which was continued. During the
afternoon on 2009-04-04 00:00:00 the patient went into atrial fibrilliation
with RVR to 140's and responded to 2 pushes of 5mg metoprolol
and 10mg diltiazam to rate controlled idioventricular rhythym in
the 60's with BP 150/80's and 100% oxygenation on RA. The
patient was noted to be unresponsive a few hours later for few
minutes , blood sugars were normal, neurological exam was
nonfocal,abdominal exam benign with no distension, only insp
crackles diffusley was observed, vitals were stable (including
systolic BP above 150, afebrile, without tachycardia), the
patient became more responsive but still delirious after 5
minutues. ABG at the time showed no carbon dioxide retention or
hypoxemia but was remarkable for lactate of 4. The MICU was
notified of the patient however the patient did not meet
transfer criteria vitals wise at the time. The patient was found
to be pulseless on the floor 2009-04-04 00:00:00 AM code blue was called and
she was transferred to MICU. In the MICU patient initally had a
pulse but quickly had another cardiac arrest. Resuscitation
efforts were continued for another 20 minutes but ultimately the
patient did not have return of circulation and she was pronouced
dead on 2009-04-04 00:00:00 at 744am.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was s/p cardioversion here twice
during this admission which failed to keep her in sinus rhythym.
Her INR continued to be elevated off coumadin for unclear
reasons, perhaps acute liver failure. Her LFT's and CK were
trending down significantly while on the floor and she had
normal liver ultrasound with patent vasculature. Continued
Amiodarone and Metoprolol per above.
.
# Acute on Chronic  systolic heart failure : Her recent EF was
approximately 40% last month.However a echocrdiogram on 2009-04-04 00:00:00
showed a EF of 20% with global hypokinesis and no coronary
distribution. Possible causes for the lowered EF could have been
volume overload, atrial fibrilliation or tachycardia induced
cardiomyopathy though this was lower on the differential. She
was volume overloaded with elevated JVD, pulmonary edema and
lower extremity edema. Was monitored clinically and admin IV
lasix per above for net goal of negative 500cc-1000cc/day. Given
40mg and 80mg lasix bolus's on 2009-04-04 00:00:00, negative 400cc as of 2009-04-04 00:00:00
6PM.

.
# Rhabdomyolysis: Her rhabdo was likely related to statin
myopathy as she was supposed to stop this medication after
recent admit to UPMCE in 2009-04-04 00:00:00 but she continued to take it
secondary to confusion with med rec. Successfully treated with
IV fluids, and creatinine normalized with good urine output on
transfer to the floor 2009-04-04 00:00:00. Etiology remained unclear, though
statin was discontinued on admission, on the differenital
remained viral myositis (studies EBV, CMy negative), autoimmune
disease. CK and LFT's had significantly trended down as of the
morning of 2009-04-04 00:00:00. Neurology recommended myositis panel, and
EMG(not done) and autoimmune panel including Mi2 pending.TSh was
normal.
.
#Transaminitis- no signs of hepatic disease on ultrasound of the
liver with patent vasculature. Experienced a significant
trasnaminits which was associated with a significant elevated
INR of 8.0. Was hypotensive by report after cardioversion and
could have been due to ischemic hepatitis with antibiotics/poor
nutrition contributing though remians unclear.
.
#. Asthma: She used albuterol inhaler PRN at home with history
of asthma and COPD per records. Continued PRN nebs while inpt.
.
#. GERD: Continued home PPI.
.
# Hyperdense brain lesion: Her CT head in the ER showed a small
<4.5 mm hyperdense focus in the L frontal area which could be
small SDH or calcium deposition. This was a film limited by
motion so repeat may be helpful to further characterize this
small area.Not signifiant given no neurological signs or
deficits, plan was to reimage when clinically stable
.
#. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: continued insulin ss

*******************
MICU course through 2009-04-04 00:00:00:
Patient admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and
respiratory distress.  Initially, this was presumed due to flash
pulmonary edema as she was hypertensive and CXR appeared to be
consistent.  Therefore, she was initially diuresed.  However, in
the morning her urine output was minimal, her hematocrit/CBC
appeared very hemoconcentrated, her lactate was rising and her
02 sats were >94% on RA.  Renal was consulted who agreed that
the patient was volume deplete and she was given 5L LR
throughout the day as well as 150ml/hr of d51/3amps of bicarb to
alkalinize the urine.  Even with this amount of fluid, her 02
sat on room air was >90%.  It was hypothesized that the patient
aspirated on the floor rather than flashed though this is
unclear.
.
The patient's creatinine increased from 1.0 to 1.4 in the first
day in the ICU.  Her urine was spun and was consistent with ATN.
 The renal consultants felt this was due to pre-renal azotemia
on the floor as well as rhabdomyolysis.  Her CK trended down
from 50,000 to 30,000 over the first day in the ICU.  Her
creatinine peaked at 2.4 and then started to trend down and her
urine output increased.  She also had evidence of hypotensive
liver injury (with some contribution from rhabdomyolysis).  Her
AST/ALT peaked in the low 2009-04-04 00:00:00 and trended down rapidly.  There
was no abnormalities in her liver synthetic function.
.
The patient' hematocrit also decreased from 47 to 34 after the
5L IVF and bicarb.  She was guaiac negative.  This was felt to
be dilutional.  However, her INR was supratherapeutic at 4.5 so
she was monitored closely for bleeding.  She did not have flank
echymosis.  Repeat HCTs were 32-37 and she had no further signs
of bleeding.
.
The patient's WBC was 22 on arrival to the ICU (up from 11 on
admission) and she had fever to 100.8.  She had copious diarrhea
so C.Diff was sent and PO Vanco and IV flagyl were started
empirically.  C. Diff came back negative x1, but the suspician
was still high so Vanco and Flagyl were continued and Cipro was
added (patient listed allergy to levofloxacin was GI upset).
She had a CT abdomen (with PO contrast only given acute renal
failure), this showed no acute process and no signs of colitis,
and 2 more C. Diff were negative so cipro, flagyl and PO vanco
were stopped.  She also had blood and urine cultures sent that
were negative.  The patient's WBC plateued and she was started
on Vanc/aztreonam for RLL infiltrate.
.
The patient's mental status was initially lethargic but after
IVF resuscitation, improved to close to her baseline per family.
 However, given the acute onset of the AMS and the patient's
supratherapeutic INR head CT was performed and showed no acute
process. Neuro was consulted for myopathy and started a workup.
The patient continued to have delirium in the ICU with
sundowning and was started on standing seroquel and night which
helped.
.
Although the patient reportedly came to the hospital in NSR, she
was tachycardic into the 140s consistently.  It was difficult to
control her rate with IV dilt, IV metoprolol because her
pressures became low.  She was trialed on esmolol drip and this
improved her rate into the 120s but this, too, was limited by
hypotension. She was cardioverted on MICU day 3 and stayed in
sinus for about 24 hours before she reverted to tachycardia.
She then had marginal blood pressures and esmolol was tried but
stopped.  Cardiology again tried cardioversion and after
discussing with liver, bolused and loaded with amiodarone.  She
became hypotensive after the cardioversion and a central line
was placed and the patient started on neo with good response.
She again reverted to tachycardia 12 hours later and received 1
more bolus of amio and reverted to sinus. She reverted yet again
on 2009-04-04 00:00:00 to afib/flutter to 130s despite being started on amio
load.  She was seen by cards who recommended diuresis and EP
consult. EP recommended digoxin loaded which improved her rates
into low 100s.

Patient was discharged from the ICU to the UPMCE where she was
noted to have a mildy elevated troponin and a decision was made
to initiate heparin.  She continued to have intermittent a.
fibrillation.  On the evening before she died, she had another
episode of atrial fibrillation.  The team rate controlled the
atrial fibrillation but approximately 8-12 hours later she
suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and was transported back to the
ICU.  I arrived in the ICU that morning while CPR was in
progress and had been for a prolonged period of time.  Despite
standard ACLS, the patient did not have ROSC and she was
pronounced dead.  Though the patient had not been under my care
for the days preceding the death, I spent time discussing the
possible reasons for her death.
