History of Present Illness:
Mr. Inserra is a 76 yo M with h/o CAD, CHF, a-fib, AVR, DM, HTN,
HLD, p/w one day of fever, rigor, nausea and vomiting. Pt felt
sudden onset rigor one day ago, with fever to 100, and BP
reportedly to 220/120 at home. He had some valium and was able
to sleep. He  Of note, pt did not have recent sickness, no
weight loss, night sweats. He did report some exercise
intolerance recently in the gym, which he attributed to
hypoglycemia. Of note, pt had a PCI with 2 drug eluting stents
placed in LAD and R-PDA. Pt had no recent dental work and never
had colonoscopy.

Pt went to 123 Any St. today, where he had VS: 102.1 HR: 101 BP:
123/49 Resp: 23 O(2)Sat: 100%. Lab showed WBC of 11.3 with 7%
Bands, INR 3.2, Cr 2.4, CK 1400, CK-MB 6, Trop 0.035; and
moderate hepatocellular transaminitis. Pt underwent noncontrast
CT-head, which did not reveal acute intracranial bleed. Blood
culture later grew GPC in pairs and clusters. Pt received 2L IVF
and one dose ceftriaxone / zosyn, and transferred to 123 Any St..
 In 123 Any St., patient was switched to nafcillin once cultures
showed MSSA. After starting nafcillin, his urine output
diminished significantly and his creatinine bumped. At this
time, the patient presented to our service.

Imaging:
Portable TEE (Complete) Done 2014-12-03 00:00:00 Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and complex atheroma n the descending thoracic
aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or
abscess seen. Normal functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis.
Mildly depressed left ventricular function. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast in the left atrium without evidence of thrombus in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of 2014-12-03 00:00:00 CONCLUSION:
1. No finding to suggest acute vascular territorial infarct; in
this setting, MRI with DWI (if feasible) would be more
sensitive.
2. Evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Chronic inflammatory disease involving the bilateral sphenoid
air cells
with superimposed acute inflammation involving the left sphenoid
air cell;
correlate clinically.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of 2014-12-03 00:00:00  IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the right
clinical
setting, less likely atelectasis.
2. No pulmonary vascular congestion.

RENAL U.S. Study Date of 2014-12-03 00:00:00  IMPRESSION: Normal renal
ultrasound. 2.4 cm exophytic left lower pole renal cyst.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of 2014-12-03 00:00:00 IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema and
enlargement of still small layering bilateral pleural effusions.

2. Persistent retrocardiac opacification that could either
represent
atelectasis though pneumonia is also a possibility in the
correct clinical
setting.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) Study Date of 2014-12-03 00:00:00  IMPRESSION: No

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o M with a history of CHF, afib, DM2, CAD with a history of
CABG s/p recent PCI in early 2014-12-03 00:00:00 with DES to LAD and
distal PDA presented to UPMCE with fever, malaise, R arm
weakness and was found to have transaminitis, bandemia, and ARF.
The patient was put on nafcillin for MSSA but developed anuria
and increase in creatinine. The patient was stabilized and
started on steroids, at which point the patient was presented to
our service.

##MSSA Bacteremia presenting as sepsis.  Likely source thought
to be due to introduction of skin bacteria during recent
coronary angiogram/PCI.  TEE on 2014-12-03 00:00:00 did not show vegetation.
Pt was followed by ID with plan to treat with 4 week course of
naficillin until 2014-12-03 00:00:00.The patient became anuric and his
creatinine bumped on nafcillin, so he was switched to cefazolin,
on which he developed a rash. It is unclear if the rash was from
the nafcillin or the cefazolin. In any case, we switched him to
vancomycin to be safe. He is to complete his course on 2014-12-03 00:00:00.
Goal trough is 15-20. Given his poor kidney function, he will
require daily trough with dosing daily to maintain that trough.
The course will complete on 2014-12-03 00:00:00.
.
#Acute renal failure d/t AIN
Pt developed progressive renal failure, which was concerning for
probable AIN due to nafcillin.  Nafcillin was discontinued, and
Nephrology was consulted.  Due to worsening renal function, pt
became progressively fluid overloaded.  Diuresis was attepted
with aggressive diuretics (Metolazone 5 mg followed by Lasix 120
mg IV, BID), with minimal response. Pt became nearly anuric, and
pt subsequently developed uremia with asterixis. Pt was also
symptomatic from volume overload, with mild dyspnea at rest,
cough, nausea, early satiety, and poor a123 Any St.e (likely d/t
bowel edema).  Pt was started on empiric steroids on 2014-12-03 00:00:00 for
presumed AIN after discussion with both Nephrology and ID.  He
will continue on Prednisone, and will taper over the next 30
days. His discharge dose is 50mg /day and it will be tapered by
5mg every 3 days until the course is completed. Urgent HD access
was obtained by Interventional Radiology, as pt is
anticoagulated on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation, as well as
aspirin and plavix.  Pt underwent his first round of HD on
2014-12-03 00:00:00. The patient required dialysis until 2014-12-03 00:00:00 at which
point his urine output increase significantly and we would
evaluate him daily, both in terms of his I/Os, and in terms of
his electrolytes and kidney function labs.  The patient did not
require any further HD, and his catheter was pulled and the
patient was discharged. The patient is to have CBC and Chem7
drawn and faxed to the nephrologists on Monday 2014-12-03 00:00:00 for follow
up.

#NSTEMI: type 2 MI due to demand in setting of sepsis presenting
with arm discomfort.  Troponin peak to 0.46 on 2014-12-03 00:00:00.
Cardiology recommended continued medical management of known CAD
with ASA/plavix (recent PCI in early 2014-12-03 00:00:00).  His dose of
statin reduced in context of use of amiodarone.  On discharge,
we decided to increase his statin dose to 80mg (home dose),
given his history of recent MI in 2014-12-03 00:00:00.

#Diabetes Type 2: uncontrolled with complications (MI): he is on
aggressive insulin regmin including parandial humalog and basal
lantus at home.  Inserra was consulted and helped up titrate his
SS and basal insulin for better glucose control.  Inserra
continued to follow and make recommendations. On 2 occasions,
the patient was found to have a glucose aroudn 50-60. On one
occasion, the patient was difficult to arouse, but was easily
reversed with dextrose. On the second occasion, he was
completely asymptomatic, though dextrose was given anyways. The
patient's sliding scale and daily NPH dose has been adjusted
based on UPMCE recs. The patient should have his glucose
monitored and his insulin should be adjusted according to his
glucose trends. It is likely that his insulin requirements will
change as his prednisone is tapered.

#Afib: paroxysmal afib known on history with afib and RVR during
ICU stay requiring a combination of betablockers and CCB as well
as initiation of amiodarone.  He underwent DCCV on 2014-12-03 00:00:00 with
return of NSR.  Since then he has been on toprol XL and
amiodarone 400mg TID.  As of 2014-12-03 00:00:00 he received 9300mg loading
dose of amiodarone and was transitioned to 200mg amiodarone
daily with f/u with cardiology to decide on any further need of
admiodarone.  He was anticoagulated with coumadin.  His INR
should be trended daily and his coumadin dose should be adjusted
accordingly, as his coumadin requirements may be different now
with his diminished kidney function.  He was discharged at a
dose of 3mg per day and INR 1.8.

#Question of stroke: presented to UPMCE at UPMCE with aphasia and
R upper extremity weakness with old strokes on non-contrast head
CT done at OSH.  Seen by neurology in ICU who felt that symptoms
could be due to recrudescence of 123 Any St.us stroke or possibly a
small new stroke in setting of sepsis.  An MRI was not possible
because he has a pacemaker.  A repeat CT performed 72 h after CT
done at 123 Any St. did not show evidence of stroke.  He reamined on
anticoagulation given afib and high risk of stroke given
CHADS2>=4.  His speech returned to baseline and he did not have
further extremity weakness other than L shoulder due to
suspected rotator cuff tear.

#Rotator cuff tear: inability to comfortable move L shoulder
with discomfort in upper arm.  Xray showed degenerative joint
disease.  Ortho consult suspected partial rotator cuff tear on
physical exam and recommended ROM as tolerated with outpatient
f/u in the sports medicine clinic.  His shoulder improved during
the course of the hospitalization.

#Thyroid function abnormalities: PMH documents history of
hypothyroidism and home med included levothyroxine, but dose of
20mcg is very low for someone his size.  TSH low at 0.042, free
T4 slightly high at 4.5.  Rather than repeat TFTs in acute
setting which could be abnormal for sick euthyroid, his dose of
levothyroxine was discontinued and recommend close outpatient
monitoring of TSH, free T4 as he is now on amiodarone.

#R cephalic vein clot noted on U/S of R upper arm, not a DVT

#Transitional Issues:
Please follow daily INR and vancomycin trough. His vancomycin
and coumadin doses need to be adjusted accordingly. His goal INR
is 2014-12-03 00:00:00. His goal trough is 15-20 until 2014-12-03 00:00:00. If the patient's
trough is less than 16, he is to get a dose of 500mg of
vancomycin. If the trough is greater than 16, the dose is to be
held for that day. He should also have a full CBC/Chem7 done on
Monday 2014-12-03 00:00:00 and the results should be faxed to [**Numeric Identifier 4028**].
