Attending:Anjelina Safewright
Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
66 yo M with mechanical AVR on [**First Name3 (LF) **], with aortic valve
enterococcal endocarditis and ring abscess, and recent GIB
(2006-08-18 00:00:00) after colonic polypectomy s/p 7 units pRBC and INR
reversal, who was transferred to UPMCE MICU for management of
hypotension and AVR abscess.
.
On arrival in the MICU, his hypotension had been resolved. His
Hct remained stable, and he was placed on heparin drip for
anticoagulation. His EKG showed PR prolongation to 400 msec.
Repeat TEE showed heterogeneous thickening of the peri-aortic
tissue consistent with an aortic root abscess. EP,
cardiothorasic surgery, and ID were consulted. EP and CSURG felt
that this could be conservatively managed until surgery, and
recommends rehab with regular EKG. ID recommended amp + gent for
treatment which was started. Patient was hemodynamically stable
and transferred to the floor.
.
ROS: No fevers, chills, nightsweats. No chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath. No abdominal pain. No urinary
symptoms. No weakness in the extremities. No
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Had resolution of dark stools and no
more episodes of bright red blood per rectum.

Final blood and urine cultures showed no growth.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypotension - Attributable to acute blood loss s/p polypectomy,
less likely sepsis from endovascular infection or arrhythmia
from conduction disease. Did not recur after admission.
.
#Acute blood loss anemia - Hematocrit remained stable after
admission, did not require additional transfusion. Started
heparin gtt on 2006-08-18 00:00:00 and bridged to warfarin without recurrence
of bleeding.
.
#E. faecalis endocarditis/aortic ring abscess - No signs or
symptoms of worsening infection or CHF. Surveillance cultures
showed no growth. Continued ampicillin and gentamicin. TEE 2006-08-18 00:00:00
showed heterogeneous thickening of the peri-aortic tissue that
could be consistent with an aortic root abscess, and moderate
eccentric aortic regurgitation. Consulted cardiac surgery who
recommended medical therapy and repeat TEE 2-3 weeks. Audiology
testing was scheduled for 2006-08-18 00:00:00 with Dr. Delna; patient was
called with this information on the day after discharge.
.
#PR prolongation: PR intervals were ~350 ms. Progressed compared
with a 2006-08-18 00:00:00 EKG. Held all nodal agents. Consulted EP who said no
indication for temporary pacing unless proceeds to cardiac
surgery. Will check EKGs on Mon, Wed, Fri. On discharge, PR
interval 292 msec.

Discharge Instructions:
1. You were transferred to UPMCE for a gastrointestinal bleed.
Your blood counts were stable during your admission, and you did
not require a transfusion while admitted.  You will need to have
blood counts checked weekly.

2. You were also admitted for a blood stream infection, and you
were found to have an infected heart valve. You were treated
with antibiotics, which you will need to continue as an
outpatient. One of these antibiotics can cause problems with
hearing, so it is very important that you have a hearing test.
You will need to have weekly labs drawn, with results faxed to
the Infectious Diseases Clinic at UPMCE (fax: test@mail.com).

Ampicillin 2 g IV Q4H (STOP ON 2006-08-18 00:00:00)
Gentamicin 80 mg IV Q12H (STOP ON 2006-08-18 00:00:00)

3. You were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm while
admitted, which was due to your infected heart valve. You will

valve. You will need to have regular INR checks to make sure
that your blood is "thin enough."  These results will need to be
faxed to your PCP, Delna Doble dosing adjusted as necessary. Your
goal INR is 2006-08-18 00:00:00.

cardiothoracic surgery, infectious disese, and your
cardiologist.  You will also need to have a repeat transthoracic
echocardiogram (TEE) as scheduled.
