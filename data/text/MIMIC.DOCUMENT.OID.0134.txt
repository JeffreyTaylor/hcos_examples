History of Present Illness:
Mr. Leffler is an 84 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for recent CAD s/p CABG c/b sternal wound infection on
antibiotics and CHB s/p PPM admitted for a lower extremity rash
concerning for vasculitis and acute renal failure. The patient
underwent CABG in 2014-08-24 00:00:00, and was re-admitted to UPMCE on 2014-08-24 00:00:00
for sternal wound exploration with a drain placed with cultures
speciated as MSSA. At that time, he was discharged on cefazolin
with the plan for a prolonged 8 weeks of antimicrobial therapy.
On 2014-08-24 00:00:00, the ID service was contactAnnicka Leffler as the patient had
developed a rash over his lower extremities concerning for a
drug rash by his physician at rehab. At that time, given that he
has a history of an unknown PCN reaction, he was converted to
vancomycin. Today, he presented to the UPMCE UPMCE clinic, and was
found to have a rash concerning for vasculitis and ARF with a
creatinine of 2 and a serum potassium of 5.7.  He was then
referred to the ED for futher management.
.
In the UPMCE ED, initial VS 97.7 60 133/48 20 95%RA.  ECG was
negative for peaked T waves, the patient received 30 mg
kayexalate, had a negative CXR, and was admitted to Medicine for
further management.  On ROS, the patient reports that he has
been feeling increasingly fatigued over the past week with
decreased PO intake, but denies any f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA,
palpitations.  He is does not know when his rash developed.
.
On the floor, pt Cr 2.0--> 1.7 with gentle fluid re123 Any St.n.
However, overnight, pt developed respiratory distress thought to
be 2.2 volume overload. He was given nebs and placed on 4L NC
with good improvement in Os sats. Over the next 24 hours, his
resp status continued to worsen requiring 6L NC. ABG
7.25/58/211/27. Given Nebs and 20mg IV lasix without
improvement. He was then transfered to the MICU for BIPAP.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post sternal
plating and
left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right
atrium and
right ventricle. Several epicardial leads are unchanged.
Cardiac,
mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Multiple external
tubing and
catheter devices are seen projecting over the left upper
quadrant and left
lung base. Patchy opacity in left lung base may reflect
atelectasis. A trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The right lung is grossly clear.  There is no pneumonia.
Surgical anchor is partly imaged projecting over the right
humeral head. No acute osseous findings are seen.

IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity in the left lung base, which could
reflect
atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. Probable trace left
pleural
effusion.

2014-08-24 00:00:00 upper ext U/S
Grey scale and Doppler sonAnnicka Leffler of the left subclavian and
right subclavian,
IJ, axillary, basilic, and cephalic veins were taken. The lumen
of the basilic vein continues to contain echogenic material from
the proximal end. There is abnormal compressibility, flow, and
augmentation of the basilic vein consistent with thrombosis of
the basilic vein. Otherwise, the remainder of the veins
demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.

IMPRESSION:
Basilic vein thrombosis, unchanged in comparison to prior study.


These findings were discussed with Dr. Jessic Debower of the
patient's primary
clinical team at approximately 11:30 a.m. on 2014-08-24 00:00:00.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


2014-08-24 00:00:00 renal u/s
The right kidney measures approximately 10.2 cm.
The left kidney measures approximately 9.8 cm.

A small simple cyst measuring 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm is visualized
in the upper pole of the right kidney. Otherwise, there is no
hydronephrosis, stones, or masses. Of note are bilateral pleural
effusions visualized.

IMPRESSION:
Normal renal sonAnnicka Leffler. Evidence of bilateral pleural effusions
was noted.
These findings were discussed with Dr. Jessic Debower of the
patient's primary clinical team at approximately 11:30 a.m. on
2014-08-24 00:00:00.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


2014-08-24 00:00:00 chest x-ray
SUPINE AP AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There are
layering bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and
small on the right, unchanged.
There is bibasilar consolidation, significantly worst on the
left and could reflect a combination of atelectasis, effusion,
and/or pneumonia. There is no significant pulmonary edema or
pneumothorax. Sternal plating hardware is unchanged, epicardial
pacing leads are again visualized. There is a left chest wall
pacer with right atrial and ventricular leads in unchanged
location. Left midline catheter and mediastinal drain is
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in moderate left and small
right pleural
effusion and large left basilar consolidation.

2014-08-24 00:00:00 chest xray
FINDINGS: As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Sternal fixators, unchanged course of pacemaker leads.
Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette, mild cardiomegaly with mild
pulmonary edema and associated bilateral small pleural
effusions. No evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities
suggestive of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Leffler is an 84 yo s/p recent CABG with sternal wound
infection admitted for presumed pre-renal ARF now with
respiratory distress most likely 2014-08-24 00:00:00 to volume overload.

# Respiratory distress: Most likely 2014-08-24 00:00:00 acute on chronic CHF.
In the MICU, on BIPAP for 45 minutes. Recieved lasix throughout
his stay (total of 200 mg IV) with partial response. He improved
on Bipap and felt to have returned to baseline by morning. No
evidence of MI; cardiac enzymes continued to hold at 0.03 (trop)
and later echo showed stably decreased EF of 45-50%. During his
course on the floor he had multiple episodes of shortness of
breath with associated desturations; thought to have a large
anxiety component causing hypertension and flash pulmonary
edema; these resolved with IV lasix, morphine, and ativan.  He
was found to have large bilateral pleural effusions. On 2014-08-24 00:00:00 his
right lung was drained of 1.5 L and on 2014-08-24 00:00:00 his left lung was
drained of 1.2 L of transudative fluid. Cytology was negative
for malignant cells.  He was aggresively diuresed with IV lasix
to doses up to 120mg IV bid (metolazone also used twice) with
gradual improvement in his respiratory status and resolution of
renal failure.  He was then transitioned to an oral lasix
regimen on 2014-08-24 00:00:00 with continued good diuresis of net neg 1000cc a
day and preserved renal function.  He will continue 80mg of
lasix twice a day for now with an initial goal of net negative
500-1000cc a day. He should have standing weights daily, strict
I/O's and have his BUN/creatinine checked on 2014-08-24 00:00:00 with lytes
repleted as needed. his lasix dose should be adjusted based on
volume status. His weight upon discharge was 80kg. O2sat stably
96-100% on 2L, in 90s on RA, and desats to 86% on RA with
ambulation.  Of note, anxiety (see below) likely plays a large
component, and pt feels more comfortable on O2 NC despite above
O2sat readings; small doses of ativan and morphine have been
helpful in the past with episodes of respiratory distress.
Please wean down oxygen supplementation slowly as tolerated.

# ARF: 2014-08-24 00:00:00 have had volume de[** Location **]n in the setting of poor PO
intake prior to admission, secondary to drug reaction to
cefazolin (intrinsic renal failure), or poor forward flow in the
setting of acute on chronic CHF.  His creatinine improved with
diuresis and was back to baseline prior to discharge. Currently
still holding lisinopril and HCTZ due to active diuresis. Please
check BUN creatinine on 2014-08-24 00:00:00 and thereafter as needed to monitor
renal function while actively diuresing. Would restart
lisinopril and HCTZ when volume status stable. Would
preferentially start lisinopril first given his CHF.

# MSSA infection: He was on cefazolin with the plan for a
prolonged 8 weeks of antimicrobial therapy followed by lifelong
suppressive therapy for retained infected pacing wires however
due to apparent drug reaction his regimen was switched to vanco
on 2014-08-24 00:00:00. He was left with a 6 week course on vancomycin with an
end date of 2014-08-24 00:00:00. He should have a CBC with
differential, chem 7 and vanc trough drawn on Thurs 2014-08-24 00:00:00,
Wednesday 2014-08-24 00:00:00, and Thursday 2014-08-24 00:00:00; please fax these to UPMCE clinic
test@mail.com to the attention of Dr. Annicka Leffler.  He will
follow up with Dr. Jessic Debower on 2014-08-24 00:00:00 and with Dr.
Annicka Leffler on 2014-08-24 00:00:00.

# Rash: Dermatology thought rash was likely leukocytoclastic
vasculitis 2014-08-24 00:00:00 ancef.  Pt and family were not interested in
biopsy so derm signed off. Would avoid use of cefazolin in
future.  Vancomycin started for continued treatment of pts
infection.

# Pain: Chronic, most likely secondary to deconditioning. Pt
received oxycodnoe prn for pain.

# Anxiety: His episodes of shortness of breath not associated
with desaturations were most likley due to his anxiety. He was
started on Ativan 0.5mg three times a day which he tolerated
well and PRN Ativan. He felt that morphine po prn helped relieve
some respiratory distress as well.

Discharge Instructions:
You were originally admitted for a progressive rash and renal
failure. This was thought to be related to the original
antibiotic (cefazolin) you were taking for the skin infection of
your sternal incision site. You initially had a drain which was
removed during your hospitalization.  Your antibiotic was
changed to vancomycin which you will take for a total of 6 weeks
(End Date 2014-08-24 00:00:00); you will have weekly labs drawn and sent to
the UPMCE clinic.  You will also follow up with the ID specialist.

You required transfer to the ICU for respiratory distress in the
setting of fluid overload. You were given medications to help
you get rid of the fluid and transferred back to the floor when
you were stable. You underwent two thoracenteses to drain the
fluid in your lungs. Your oxygen saturation improved with these
measures.  Gradually, your kidney function also improved.  You
will continue oral lasix.  You should weigh yourself daily and
call your physician regarding weight gain > 3 lbs in one day.

Medication changes:
- 6-week course of vancomycin to complete a total 8-week course
of antibiotic treatment (End 2014-08-24 00:00:00)
- Lisinopril held for now until renal function stable
- Hydrochlorothiazide held for now until renal function is
stable
- Inrease Lasix 80mg twice a day, dose to be adjusted as needed
by rehab physician
Annicka Leffler Annicka Leffler treatments
- Morphine tab as needed for shortness of breath
- Ativan for anxiety
- Fluticasone spray for nasal congestion
- Ocean nasal spray as needed for nasal congestion
- Guanefesin (Robitussin) as needed for cough
- Oxygen therapy as needed

Followup Instructions:
You will be discharged to rehab.  Please follow up with your
PCP, Leffler. Leffler, within 1-2 weeks of discharge from rehab.
