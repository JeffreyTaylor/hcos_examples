Attending:Kiania Scercy
Chief Complaint:
pain crisis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
46 yo F with sickle cell anemia, multiple admission for pain
crises who presented with an acute onset bilateral knee,
shoulder, hip, and chest pain, consistent with prior pain
crises.

The patient experienced the acute onset of knee pain the morning
of her admission, while brushing her teeth, about 20 minutes
after getting up. This was followed by chest, shouler, and hip
pain bilaterally. Given the severe pain, the patient presented
to the emergency room.

4L/NC. The patient was given normal saline 1 liter and dilaudid
1 mg IV x 3.

There was concern that she was developing acute chest and she
was admitted to the MICU. She complained of significant pain
when she arrived the the ICU.

complications including avascular necrosis of R hip, acute chest
syndrome, and pulmonary infarction. Spleen autoinfarction.

Throat Strep 2010-03-17 00:00:00: Negative

CXR 2010-03-17 00:00:00:
1. Since the recen radiograph one day prior, there has been
development of
new bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, likely pulmonary
edema, however infection and infarction cannot be excluded.
2. Development of marked cardiomegaly and findings consistent
with heart
failure.
3. Multiple loops of distended large bowel incompletely imaged
on this
radiograph.

CXR 2010-03-17 00:00:00:
A right IJ central line is present, tip over right atrium,
relatively low.  Clinical correlation regarding possible
retraction is requested.  There are low inspiratory volumes.
There is probable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal
silhouette, even allowing for this. There are diffuse patchy
opacities throughout both lungs, increased retrocardiac density
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
and equivocal small effusions.  Again seen is diffuse increased
density of the bones, likely related to the patient's sickle
cell. Increased density at the right humeral head could be due
to osteonecrosis.Compared with 2010-03-17 00:00:00 at 2:04 a.m. and allowing
for technical differences, no definite interval change.

Tib/Fib X-Ray 2010-03-17 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2010-03-17 00:00:00, there is
little overall
change. Again there are areas of sclerosis involving the distal
femur,
proximal and much of the shaft of the tibia, and the talar dome.
Findings areall consistent with bone infarcts consistent with
the patient's known
diagnosis of sickle cell anemia.

ECHO 2010-03-17 00:00:00:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of 2010-03-17 00:00:00, the left ventricular ejection fraction is
somewhat lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo F with sickle cell anemia, multiple admission for pain
crises, who presented with the acute onset bilateral knee,
shoulder, hip, and chest pain. She developed hypoxia and
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, requiring MICU transfer for
exchange transfusion.

#Sickle cell disease/Acute Chest Syndrome: The patient presented
with severe pain. Her initial chest x-ray was normal. EKG was
normal, and MI was ruled out with serial cardiac enzymes. The
patient was treated with oxygen, IV fluids, and IV Dilaudid for
presumed vaso-occlusive pain crisis. The day after admission,
she developed fever to 101.8 and a progressive oxygen
requirement, with CXR showed bilateral infiltrates and a
massively dilated heart. Due to concern for acute chest
syndrome, she was transferred to the MICU. She was started on
CTX/azithro for coverage of community-acquired pneumonia.

In the MICU, given the patient's high-grade hemolysis and acute
chest syndrome she underwent exchange transfusion on 2010-03-17 00:00:00
with a total of 6 units of PRBC's infused, with a goal of
getting her hemoglobin S concentration under 30%. A right
internal jugular central venous catheter was placed for access.
Her post exchange transfusion hematocrit was 24.5, and initially
remained stable until the morning of 2010-03-17 00:00:00 when it dropped to
21.1, she was given 1 unit of PRBC's with improvement only to
22, with a goal hemoglobin of over 8.  She was given another
unit of PRBC's and her Hct stabilized around 28.

The patient had a lot of difficulty with pain-control, requiring
an IV Dilaudid PCA and bolus doses of IV dilaudid for
breakthrough pain. The pain service was consulted, and assited
with management. After exchange transfusion the patient was
significantly better controlled on the hydromorphone PCA and prn
IV hydromorphone. She was transferred back to the floor on 2010-03-17 00:00:00.
She was was subsequently placed on a PO dialudid regimen. She
was discharge with 24 extra tabe of dilaudid.

# Fever: She spiked fever to 101 shortly after leaving ICU and
had another low grade temp however fever curve improved. CXR
improved and she was asymptomatic. Urine and blood cultures were
negative. She noted that she typically has low grade temps
during her crises. She was started on a 7 day course of
levofloxacin. She will complete her course on 2010-03-17 00:00:00.

# Constipation: She had not had a bowel movement since 2010-03-17 00:00:00. She
noted that she has gone 2 weeks 123 Any St.usly without a bowel
movement. She was on colace and senna but was resistent to
trying any other Kiania Scercy. She did have a bowel movement prior to
discharge and never had notable pain, distension, or nausea.

# Proteinuria: Patient with a history of proteinuria and was
started on lisinopril 2.5mg as an outpatient. Initially held but
was restarted prior to discharge.

# Left Lower Extremity Growth: This was noted during her
123 Any St.us hospitatlization which was closely monitored. X-ray was
done to check for possible osteo which was negative. X-ray did
show findings consistent with bone infarction.

# Hepatitis C- Genotype 1B. Chronic, stable. Diagnosed in early
2010-03-17 00:00:00's, likely 2010-03-17 00:00:00 chronic transfusions. Liver biopsy 2010-03-17 00:00:00 with
stage III fibrosis. In 2010-03-17 00:00:00, was on peg interferon & ribavarin,
but d/c'd due to neutropenia.
