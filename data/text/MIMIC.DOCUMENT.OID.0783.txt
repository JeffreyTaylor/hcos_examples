Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Ilenna Wildmon
Chief Complaint:
abnormal CXR, anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
central line placement
bronchoscopy
arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84M with prostate CA, CAD, HTN who presents
with 2 weeks dry cough. He saw his hematologist who ordered a
CXR for the cough, and it showed extensive heterogenous
opacification in the right lung. Because of these abnormal
findings, his PCP told him to come to the ED for evaluation.

He has had the intermittent dry cough for about two weeks but
has not had fevers, chills, weight loss, change in a123 Any St.e,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. He has noticed
some fatigue, as he used to walk two miles a day until the cough
started, but notes he is limited by fatigue, not DOE. No other
symptoms. In the ED he was noted to have a dropping Hct (25.4,
down from 29.6 the 123 Any St.us day). He has not noted blood in his
stool or had any lightheadedness. He was guaiac negative. He was
being worked up for anemia and was not found to have evidence of
iron, folate or B12 deficiency in 2011-04-02 00:00:00. SPEP was also normal.
After discussion with his PCP by the Drevin Tooke, he is being admitted
for expedited workup of CXR findings and anemia. Pulmonology was
consulted in the ED.

2011-04-02 00:00:00 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
Multiple midline sternotomy wires are unchanged in position.
Small surgical clips are seen along the left cardiac border,
compatible with prior CABG. The two-chamber pacemaker with ICD
is seen with leads in the right ventricle and right atrium,
unchanged. There is mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.

New, extensive, heterogeneous opacification is seen
predominately in the right lung, with peripheral consolidation
and lesser degree of central opacification. Right- sided volume
loss suggests a chronic process. Left basilar opacities are
compatible with atelectasis, and the left lung is otherwise
clear.

IMPRESSION:
Compared to 2011-04-02 00:00:00 study, new extensive heterogeneous
opacification in the right lung with peripheral consolidation
and lesser degree of central opacification. Loss of right lung
volume suggests a subacute process. Differential is broad,
including pneumonia, postinfectious and cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, multifocal bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, chronic
eosinophilic pneumonia, Churg- Ilenna Wildmon vasculitis, amiodarone
toxicity.

2011-04-02 00:00:00 CXR:
No interval change over one day in appearance of diffuse
airspace opacity involving the right hemithorax. Additional
opacity seen in the left base, also unchanged. Original
differential diagnosis stands and multifocal pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

CT CHEST: FINDINGS
The patient is intubated. Pooling of secretions are above the
cuff of the
endotracheal tube. Small layering bilateral non-hemorrhagic
pleural effusions
are increased on the right and new on the left. Diffuse
extensive areas of
ground-glass opacity, peribronchial consolidation, and
bronchiectasis have
worsened in the left lung, minimally improved in the right upper
lobe. Right
central catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Transvenous pacemaker
lead terminates
in a standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm. Dense
calcifications are in the native coronary arteries. There is
mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly. The cardiac Ilenna Wildmon are hypodense. This suggests
anemia.
Calcification in the aortic valve is of unknown hemodynamic
significance. AP
window and prevascular lymph nodes have increased in size; for
instance,
to 8 mm from 5 mm and to 5 mm from 3 mm respectively.

This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation, and the
upper abdomen is unremarkable.

There are no bone findings of malignancy.

In the abdomen, 123 Any St.usly described renal lesion is not
included in this
examination.
IMPRESSION: Worsening of pre-existing opacity in the left lung
and slight
improvement of the abnormalities in the right upper lobe

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior wall and apex. There is mild hypokinesis of the
inferior septum and inferior wall. There is an anteroapical left
ventricular aneurysm. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with multi-vessel CAD. No significant valvular abnormality seen.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2011-04-02 00:00:00, LV
systolic dysfunction appears regional on the current study (as
it did on study of 2011-04-02 00:00:00). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressures are higher on the current study


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Tooke is an 85 yo M with CAD s/p CABG/ICD,CHF ef20%
prostate ca who presents with dry cough found to have diffuse
right sided patchy peripheral opacities on cxr, transferred to
the ICU for hypoxia.  He had a UPMCE hospital course and
was intubated with persistant hypoxic resp failure. Etiology was
unclear with concern for eosinophilic pneumonia, HAP, pulm
edema. Due to progressive decline and poor prognosis, family
decided to make him comfort measures only and patient passed
away on 2011-04-02 00:00:00 17:10.

Hospital Course by problem:
.
#Hypoxic Resp Failure: Over his UPMCE hospital course, he
had continued decline of respiratory status of unclear etiology.
Initial bronchoscopy revealed high eosinophilia and he was felt
to have eosinophilic pneumonia and treated with a course of
steroids although he did not have a dramatic improvement in his
resp status. Shortly after this, he was transferred to the ICU
for worsening hypoxia and intubated. Repeat CT chests showed
worsening  progression of disease adn well as new infiltrates
concerning for infectious etiology. Initially, it was also felt
there was a component of pulm edema and he was aggressively
diuresed. At this point, after meeting w/ family and CT Surgery,
it was felt that VATS was not an option given his tenuous
status. Repeat bronch on 2011-04-02 00:00:00 was w/o infectious results. Sputum
culture ultimately with sparse orpharyngeal flora.
Galactomannan, Tularemia, Strongyloides, and IgE were
unremarkable. He was treated with broad coverage antibiotics
with no improvement in resp status and further worsening of
disease. Finally, it was decided by family, given his additional
decline of other organ systems, to withdraw care.

# ? VAP pneumonia - s/p bronch, infectious studies with no
obvious source. No microorganisms on gram stain from BAL. Sputum
culture ultimately with sparse orpharyngeal flora. On CT,
infiltrate had the appearance of progressive underlying process
rather than new consolidation.  Fever and infiltrate on CXR may
not really have been VAP but rather part of underlying lung
disease.

# Diffuse right peripheral infiltrates - BAL 30% eosinophils,
also with peripheral eosinophilia most likely 2011-04-02 00:00:00 acute
eosinophilic pneumonia.  PCP negative, respiratory viral
antigens neg, BAl neg for bacterial pathogens. Legionella neg.
Per pulmonary consult, he may have "eosinophilic process
secondary to malignancy or something like a non-steroid
responsive BOOP". Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative;
mycolytic blood culture negative. Histo negative. Chest CT
worse.

# Fever: During his hospital course, he intermittently had high
fevers with no clear infectious etiology isolated. Blood, urine,
sputum, BAL, stool all negative. CT sinuese negative. CVL were
changed.

# ARF: He had waxing and Ilenna Wildmon course, but towards end of
hospital stay, his creatinine was rapidly rising. Urine sediment
revealed muddy brown casts c/w ATN.

# LUE DVT - increased welling L>R, confirmed on U/S 2011-04-02 00:00:00 to
involve axillary and probably brachial veins. Heparin gtt was
started.

# Anemia: he was noted to have anemia since 2011-04-02 00:00:00, slowly
trending down but without any acute drops and no evidence of
bleeding.  He has been followed by Drevin Tooke/Drevin Ilenna Wildmon of
hematology.  Work up thus far is negative for iron/folate/B12
deficient.  Thought possibly from hormone therapy for prostate
CA.  No evidence of hemolysis on admission. Bone marrow biopsy
showed anemia of chronic dz, maybe MDS.  Transfused 1unit 2011-04-02 00:00:00
with good response. Found to have warm autoimmune ab.

# Warm autoimmune Ab: 123 Any St.usly no evidence of hemolysis with
elevated haptoglobin. Hapto/LDH not suggestive of hemolysis.

# VT/ NSVT, SSS, s/p PM/ICD:  has had runs of VT; likely in
setting of intubation. Had 2 further episodes of SVT 2011-04-02 00:00:00, ECG
w/ new T-wave changes but CEs negative x3. EP was aware and felt
this was most likely related to intubation.

# CAD s/p MI/CABG: no evidence of acute ischmia on arrival to
ICU, chest pain free.  EKG with LBBB at baseline, no change.
2011-04-02 00:00:00 ECG w/ new T-wave changes but CEs negative x3.

#Chronic Systoic heart failure - likely 2011-04-02 00:00:00 ischemic
cardiomyopathy - Echo 2011-04-02 00:00:00 with EF of 20%, PCWP >18, 1+ MR,
1+TR. Repeat TTE unchanged.

# h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but
patient reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his
symptoms.  He is followed by Dr. Tooke.
