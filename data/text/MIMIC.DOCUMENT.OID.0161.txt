HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Please note this is from
Cardiology's dictated pre catheterization admission note as
there was no history and physical examination from his
preoperative visit in the chart.

This is a 69-year-old male patient of Dr. Felicite Felicite Javen Gutelius
with a longstanding history of exertional angina and abnormal
stress test now with worsening symptoms who was referred for
outpatient catheterization to UPMCE.  He reports that for the past five to six years he
has been experiencing exertional back pain until recently.
It occurred with activity such as walking and was resolved
with rest.  Over the past two to three weeks, he feels that
his symptoms have gotten worse.  The pain is now radiating to
his chest and seems to last for a longer period of time,
requiring nitroglycerin for relief.  He also reports having
dyspnea after climbing hills.  He does report occasionally
having symptoms at rest over the past few weeks, for which he
takes nitroglycerin with relief.  He states this occurs one
to two times per week on average.

Please refer to the official cardiac catheterization report
dated 2005-09-13 00:00:00.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On 2005-09-13 00:00:00 - the day of
admission - the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times four by Dr. Javen Gutelius with a left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, a
vein graft to the ramus, a vein graft to the obtuse marginal,
and a vein graft to the right coronary artery.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on a Levophed drip at 0.15
mcg/kilogram per minute and a propofol drip at 10
mcg/kilogram per minute.  Early that morning, the patient had
been extubated overnight and was on an epinephrine drip for
tone.

On postoperative day one, he had received 1 amp of
bicarbonate and 5 units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit that was low, and his hematocrit rose to 34.  In
that first 24 hour postoperative period, his heart was
regular in rate and rhythm.  His chest tubes were in place.
He had decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  His abdomen was
soft.  He had 1 plus trace edema peripherally.  His Lopressor
was held for a heart rate of 89 in a sinus rhythm, but his
blood pressure was only 98/46.  At that time, he began Lasix
diuresis.  A cortisol level was checked.  Levophed remained
at 0.2 mcg/kilogram per minute.

On postoperative day two, a right femoral line was placed for
problem with the right arterial line.  He was on Levophed
0.01, sinus rhythm at 89, blood pressure was 106/42.  His
heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  He had decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  The incisions were clean, dry,
and intact at that time.  He was encouraged to work with
nurses on aggressive pulmonary toilet.  He was afebrile with
a white blood cell count of 8.1, and he continued to be
weaned from his pressors.  His potassium was 4.7, with a
blood urea nitrogen of 28, and a creatinine of 0.9.  He was
also on a Pitressin drip at 0.04.  He was seen by Case
Management.

On postoperative day three, he was weaned from his drips and
transferred out to the floor to begin working with Physical
Therapy more aggressively.  His chest tubes were
discontinued.  His vasopressin was weaned.  He was in a sinus
rhythm at 100, with a blood pressure of 126/59, and
saturating 94 percent on room air.  His potassium was 4.4,
blood urea nitrogen was 31, creatinine was 0.8.  He had
decreased breath sounds at the bases with 2 plus peripheral
edema.  His hematocrit dropped to 26.8, and this was
rechecked.  Beta blockade was begun later in the day, and his
intravenous Lasix was increased to 40 twice daily.  A repeat
chest x-ray was ordered.  The patient was evaluated again by
Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day four, he had some premature atrial
contractions in the morning and some rapid atrial
fibrillation late in the day prior.  His beta blockade was
increased to 12.5 twice daily.  He was off all of his
pressors at this time.  He was alert and oriented with a
nonfocal examination.  His heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His edema had
decreased to 1 plus bilaterally.  The incisions were clean,
dry, and intact.  He was started on amiodarone by mouth, and
his pacing wires were discontinued.  His hematocrit remained
stable at 27.8, with a potassium of 4.4, with a blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine of 29 and 0.8; respectively.  Blood
sugar management continued to be an issue for which the
patient received additional conversations with his health
care providers.

On postoperative day five, the patient had another episode of
rapid atrial fibrillation in the 170s the evening prior which
was treated with intravenous Lopressor, magnesium, and
amiodarone.  He converted to a normal sinus rhythm at a rate
of 100 with a blood pressure of 114/58.  His creatinine
remained stable at 0.7.  His hematocrit rose slightly to
28.4.  He continued with his diuresis.  He was continued on
amiodarone at 400 mg by mouth three times per day.  His
examination was otherwise unremarkable.  His Lopressor was
increased to 25 mg twice daily, and he continued his
diuresis.

On postoperative day six, the patient remained stable.  There
were no events overnight.  His hematocrit dropped slightly to
26.7.  He was started on Coumadin.  His Lopressor was
increased to 50 twice daily for a blood pressure of 130/58
and a heart rate of 86.  He continued on his oral amiodarone.
He received 2 mg of Coumadin that evening with discharge
planning begun.  His wounds were unremarkable as was the rest
of his examination.  He continued to be on sliding-scale
insulin for persistent elevated blood sugars.

On postoperative day seven, the date of discharge, his blood
pressure was 106/57, with a pulse of 70, saturating 95
percent on room air.  His blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
were 22 and 0.8.  His hematocrit was 28.3.  His examination
was unremarkable with trace peripheral edema.  His incisions
were clean, dry, and intact.  He was doing very well.  He was
ambulating well.  His amiodarone was decreased to twice daily
with plans to discharge him for home and to continue his
Coumadin therapy.
