Respiratory distress

Mechanical ventilation (2008-11-21 00:00:00/08)

History of Present Illness:
45 yo M with PMH of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma (since 2008-11-21 00:00:00)
s/p auto and allogeneic transplant with recurrence, last
chemotherapy (gemcitabine, navelbine, decadron 2008-11-21 00:00:00), ? of
bleomycin toxicity recently discharged after prolonged
hospitalization with MICU stay, 2008-11-21 00:00:00 pneumonia, complicated by
renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis, who presented
with SOB. He states this feels like an asthma exacerbation.
.
Was febrile when seen in clinic to 102, 88% on RA, was noted to
be wheezing and tachycardic. Received 2 gm cefepime,
posiconazole, and solumedrol 20mg IV (takes 10mg prednisone at
baseline). Pt was admitted to BMT. He was continued on cefepime
and vancomycin was added to abx coverage. Pt became
progressively tachypneic and UPMCE was called to evaluate
patient.

muscles, tachypneic to the 40s, O2 sat of 90% on 6L with HR in
the 140s. ABG was 7.23/36/59/16. Lactate 1.7. He was transferred
to the UPMCE for further management. He was intubated on arrival
without complication

Physical Exam:
VS: T 102 BP 79/55 (normotensive prior to intubation) HR 129 97%
on AC 24x450 PEEP 5 FiO2 50%
GEN: NAD, intubated, sedated
HEENT: PERRL, OP clear, MMM, conjunctiva pink, sclera anicteric

NECK: unable to assess JVP
CHEST: CTAB anteriorly and laterally
CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, no m/r/g
ABD: soft, NT, NT, no masses, or organomegaly
EXT: WWP, LUE significant 3+ edema, other ext no c/c/e
SKIN:
NEURO: PERRL, responds to verbal stimuli but does not follow
commnands


Pertinent Results:
CXR 2008-11-21 00:00:00: 1. Right middle and lower lobe consolidation,
concerning for infection. 2. Slight decrease in small left
pleural effusion and unchanged small right pleural effusion. 3.
Otherwise no significant change when compared to the 123 Any St.us
radiograph.

CXR 2008-11-21 00:00:00: In comparison with the study of 2008-11-21 00:00:00, the
endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes have been removed. No change in the appearance
of the
central venous catheter. Patchy opacification in the right mid
lung may be
slightly less. Otherwise, little change.

CT W/O CONTRAST 2008-11-21 00:00:00: 1. No pulmonary edema. Multifocal
pneumonia progressed since 2008-11-21 00:00:00 Chest CT, but
improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between 2008-11-21 00:00:00
and 2008-11-21 00:00:00. 2. Right infrahilar mass decreased in size since
2008-11-21 00:00:00, retroperitoneal adenopathy and left adrenal mass
decreased since 2008-11-21 00:00:00. These areas may represent
treatment response of lymphoma. 3. Conventional chest
radiography should be sufficient to chart the course of
intrathoracic findings over the near future.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever,
hypoxia and new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given
respiratory distress.

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS & ICU COURSE: Transferred to MICU the
morning after admission on 2008-11-21 00:00:00 and intubated for respiratory
distress.  Intubated on presentation to ICU for respiratory
distress. Thought initially to have pneumonia - infiltrates in
RUL and RML. For empiric coverage, posaconazole, vancomycin,
meropenem, and levofloxacin were started per ID recommendations.
BAL was performed. Bronchoscopy demonstrated mild erythema of
airways but no visible obstruction.  PCP, Deina Himmel, and viral
cultures were negative. AFB, legionella, galactomann negative.
Cryptococcus antigen, CMV viral load negative. Urine legionella
negative. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures negative.
Beta-glucan was positive, although patient did not improve on
anti-Deina Himmel alone.
With lack of success with antibiotics, thought then switched to
possibility of fluid overload. Diureses with Lasix with rapid
resolution of symptoms. Vigileo showed CO=9.6, CI=5.8,
indicating hypervolemia with good cardiac function. Pulmonary
Himmel-occlusive disease was considered to be etiology -
diagnostic work up would include right heart catheterization.
Patient does not want any invasive procedures at this time.
On 2008-11-21 00:00:00, he was given IVIG.  A TTE demonstrated preserved EF
with new TR gradient.  On 2008-11-21 00:00:00, vancomycin was stopped per ID
and BMT recs.  He was started on furosemide 20mg IV x2 with good
urine output and then on a lasix drip on 2008-11-21 00:00:00.  On 2008-11-21 00:00:00, he was
extubated.  A sputum gram stain showed 1+ GPC in pairs, chains,
and clusters, and vancomycin was restarted.  On 2008-11-21 00:00:00, he was
extubated and satting well on only on 2L NC.  He was called out.

HYPOXIA/PNEUMONIA - Hypoxia was thought to be either from a
2008-11-21 00:00:00 infection that returned following the discontinuation of
posaconazol, or from a new bacterial pneumonia.  Levoquin
(started 2008-11-21 00:00:00) and Vancomycin were stopped when called out
(2008-11-21 00:00:00).  All diagnostic studies were negative except for some
pleural gram stains showing GPC and a positive b-glucan (drawn
before IVIG).  Standing PO Lasix was stopped and he continued to
breath well with even I/Os.  He was continued on solmeterol,
ipatroprium, prednisone 10 mg daily.
A repeat beta-glucan was elevated (> 500), but as this was drawn
after IVIG, this was of unclear significance.
He had a low-grade temp to 100 and mild hypotension on 2008-11-21 00:00:00
concerning for infection.  Vancomycin was added back.  ID was
reconsulted.  Repeat chest CT showed interval improvement.
Fevers resolved.  On 2008-11-21 00:00:00, Vancomycin was discontinued and
meropenem was stopped on 2008-11-21 00:00:00.  He remained afebrile with
normal pressures off antibiotics.  Mild fevers and hypotension
were thought not to be related to infection
** Posaconazole needs to be continued, start date 2008-11-21 00:00:00.

# HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. Recurrent, last chemotherapy with
Gemcitabine, Navelbine, and Decadron on 2008-11-21 00:00:00.  Given acute
respiratory failure and possible infection, further treatment
was delayed.  He was continued on acyclovir prophylaxis.

# DECONDITIONING - His multiple hospitalizations and chronic
disease have left him severly deconditioned.  He was seen by
physical therapy.  Following several days of active physical
therapy he was able to walk with a walker again, but still
unable to stand from sitting.  He was discharged to a facility
where he can continue active physical therapy.

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE.  This was felt to be due to contrast.
Falling since last admission when patient was suspected of
having renal failure secondary to contrast. Last admission which
required HD; had renal biopsy at that time with findings
consistent with ATN. Good urine production > 100/hour while on
lasix with stable creatinine. Medications renally dosed.  His
creatinine continued to improve following discharge from the
MICU, when his lasix was discontinued.  His creatinine on
discharge was 1.6

# HISTORY OF BLEOMYCIN TOXICITY. Goal to limit oxygen
supplementation to less than 2L to prevent further lung
toxicity.

# HYPOTHYROIDISM. He was continued on home levothyroxine.

# HBV core Ab positive. He was continued on lamivudine therapy.


# FEN: Regular diet. Magnesium and Potassium sliding scales

# Prophylaxis: PPI, ambulation, bowel regimen.
Inhaled pentamadine was last given on 2008-11-21 00:00:00

# Access: R portacath

# Contact: HCP, Deina Himmel Deina Himmel, father of patient,

# Code: Full.  Discussed with patient 2008-11-21 00:00:00.
