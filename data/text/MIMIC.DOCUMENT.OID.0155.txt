Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78 yo f with h/o COPD with home O2 3L requirement, CAD
s/p CABG in 2007-05-06 00:00:00, CHF with EF 30%, PVD s/p aortofemoral bypass,
RLL granuloma, HL, and h/o dementia who presents to the ED in
respitatory distress. Pt and son gave history in the Collyns Goodwyn that
that she became more SOB with increased o2 requirement (unknown
how much she increased it to). She came in to the hospital
tonight for SOB and reported some increase in her allergies but
no fever.

In the ED her vitals soon after arrival were HR 110s BP 194/79
RR30 o2 sat 94% on 8L face mask. She was found to be in obvious
respiratory distress using accessory muscles, tachypnic, poor
air flow, and speaking in one word sentences. She became
diaphoretic with CP and got 0.4mg of SL nitro with resolution of
chest pain. She became tachy to 123 with RR 37 and BP 200/90
then was started on a nitro gtt at 2mg/kg/hr which was increased
to 3mg/kg/hr. At some point dropped her sats to 85%. She was
started on BiPAP with obvious improvement. Her CXR showed pulm
vascular congestion. She was given 2mg IV magnesium, solumedrol
125 IV x1, azithromycin 500mg for COPD exacerbation. Her EKG
showed sinus tach with prominent p waves and LVH as well as ST
elevation in v1 & v2 which was similar to prior. Cardiology was
consulted and said this is likely strain in the setting of
respiratory distress. Exam notable for wheezes, poor air
movement, and rhonci throughout. She received 20 IV lasix prior
to leaving the ED. Vitals at time of transfer were HR 101 BP
159/64 RR30 02 sat 100% on BiPap.

On the floor, VS were BiPAP 8/8 Fio2 100 with afebrile RR 25, HR
99 BP 149/55. She was wearing the BiPAP but able to answer yes
and no to questions. Able to confirm history that last few days
had increased SOB, non productive cough, wheezing, weakness, and
increased allergies including nasal congestion, runny nose, and
sinus pressure.

Review of systems:
(+) for increased frequency of urination
(-) Denies fever, chills tions, or weakness. Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in
bowel habits. Denies dysuria or urgency. Denies arthralgias or
myalgias.

ECHO: 2007-05-06 00:00:00
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with septal, anterior and apical akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate (2007-05-06 00:00:00+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2007-05-06 00:00:00, the LVEF is slightly lower and the
estimated PA pressure has increased.
.
CHEST X-RAY 2007-05-06 00:00:00
1. Interval improvement in congestive heart failure.
2. Mild interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and
retrocardiac
left lung base opacity likely representing atelectasis.
3. COPD, with no new evidence of pneumonia.
.
SHOULDER X-RAY 2007-05-06 00:00:00
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER: There is mild glenohumeral
joint
degenerative change, with spurring at the inferior glenoid.
There is minimal acromioclavicular joint degenerative change.
There has been prior midline sternotomy, with intact sternal
wires partially visualized, as is a left brachiocephalic venous
stent. Soft tissues appear unremarkable, as does the visualized
right lung apex.
IMPRESSION: Mild glenohumeral joint degenerative change.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo f with h/o COPD with home O2 3L requirement, CAD s/p CABG
in 2007-05-06 00:00:00, CHF with EF 30%, PVD s/p aortofemoral bypass, RLL
granuloma, HL, and h/o dementia who presents to the ED in
respitatory distress with likely component of COPD, systolic
CHF, and ? LLL pneumonia.  She was initially admitted to the
MICU and was transferred to the floor on 2007-05-06 00:00:00.  Hospital
course by problem list:
.
# COPD: Pt arrived from 123 Any St. with BiPAP 8/8 and was able to
quickly wean off.  She did not require noninvasive ventilatory
support for the duration of her ICU stay. Initially received
solumedrol 125 IV q8 hrs then transitioned to po prednisone
daily.  Levoquin was used in place of azithro for COPD
exacerbation due to allergy to erythomycin.  She tolerated well
and was able to be weaned down to 3L which is her home dose.
She was discharged on a 5 day course of Levofloxacin (to end on
2007-05-06 00:00:00) and a Prednisone taper as follows: 40mg on 2007-05-06 00:00:00,
change to 20mg on 2007-05-06 00:00:00 for 3 days, then 10mg on 2007-05-06 00:00:00 for 3
days, then stop.
.
# Acute on chronic CHF exacerbation: BNP elevated to 9000.  Echo
on HD1 showed severe regional LV systolic dysfunction with
septal, anterior, and apical akinesis (EF 25-30%); no aortic
stenosis; mild-mod mitral regurg, mod tricuspid regurg; severe
pulm artery systolic hypertension; very small pericardial
effusion - no signs of tamponade; compared to 2007-05-06 00:00:00, the LVEF
is slightly lower and the estimated PA pressure has increased.
The patient received a dose of IV lasix on arrival to the ICU
and was maintained on a nitro gtt.  Respiratory status improved
rapidly and the nitro drip was weaned off.  She was started on a
Captopril for her heart failure.  Blood pressure should be
controlled below 140/90.
.
# Shoulder Pain: She reported increased shoulder pain during her
echocardiogram.  Shoulder x-ray did not show fracture.  She was
seen by the Chronic Pain Service who performed a cortisone
injection on 2007-05-06 00:00:00.  She should follow-up with her pain
specialist, Dr. Goodwyn.
.
# Foot pain: continued gabapentin, tramadol, carisoprodol.
.
# GI: continued home loperamide UPMCE.
.
# Dementia: continued home aricept & zyprexa & chlordiazepoxide

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with elevated blood pressure, increased
shortness of breath, and congestive heart failure.  We were able
to control your blood pressure and control the exacerbation of
COPD and heart failure.  You had pain in your shoulder and feet,
we performed Xray and determined that you did not have a
fracture.  You had a cortisone injection on 2007-05-06 00:00:00 by the pain
team.  You improved with treatment and was discharged in stable
condition.

Please follow up with your primary care doctor.
