Stat addendum:

Unfortunately, the patient was not discharged on 2005-09-21 00:00:00
as expected.  On the morning of 2005-09-21 00:00:00, he went into
status epilepticus secondary to missing his scheduled doses
of his oral anti-epileptics.  He was immediately intubated
for adequate airway protection and transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for a brief stay.  In the Intensive Care
Unit, he was started on an Ativan drip to break his seizures
and was loaded with Dilantin.  His antibiotics were also
changed to intravenous clindamycin and ceftriaxone for a
presumed aspiration pneumonia.  A head CT was obtained which
was negative for any hemorrhage or acute changes from his
prior study.

The patient was extubated without any complications after a
24 hour stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  The EEG was
obtained prior to extubation which confirmed severe
encephalopathy, but no further seizure activity.  The patient
was then transferred to the floor on 2005-09-21 00:00:00 in stable
condition.  His Ativan drip, his OT tube and his central line
were all discontinued.  His IV Dilantin was then changed to
po Dilantin and was increased by the neurology service.
Daily Dilantin levels were checked.  He continued to remain
afebrile with all vitals stable throughout the rest of his
hospital stay.  He remained seizure free and was able to
tolerate po's (both medications and food) without any
trouble.  His intravenous antibiotics were changed to a po
regimen on the day of discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He will be discharged back to his group
home on 2005-09-21 00:00:00 in good condition.  He is to resume all
pre admission medications with the addition of po Dilantin
125 mg in the morning, 100 at noon and 100 at night.  He is
also to complete a seven day course of po Levaquin.  He is to
follow up with Dr. Pitzen, his neurologist, within the
next two weeks.
