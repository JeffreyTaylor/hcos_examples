Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 86yo F with h/o gastritis/Cordelra Jarosek tear,
diverticulosis presenting with hematochezia.
.
# Acute blood loss anemia/diverticular bleed: Given multiple
diverticulosis found on c-scope in 2012-06-18 00:00:00 and painless abdomen,
thought to be most likely secondary to diverticular bleeds.  Hct
remained on the floor for two day, and pt underwent a bowel prep
with Golytely and noted to have a small blood passing with prep,
but hct/hemodynamics remained stable. Pt underwent colonoscopy
on 2012-06-18 00:00:00 and noted to have large amount of bleeds from
left-sided colon and severe diverticulosis and a three point hct
drop from 35 to 32 but  stayed hemodynamically stable.  Pt was
transferred to UPMCE for closer monitoring and IR was made aware
for possible embolization in case pt continued to bleed.  Pt
stopped bleeding in UPMCE and was tranfused with 1 unit of PRBC.
The following day, she was transferred back to the floor as
active bleeding stopped and hemodynamics stabilized.  On the
floor, pt received 1 more unit of PRBC for hct <32 but did not
further have BRBPR.  Surgery was consulted to explain risks of
possible colectomy emergently as well as for elective procedure
for prophylaxis for any furture diverticular bleeds.  Pt decided
to consider emergent surgery if needed but deferred elective
surgery.  After one unit of PRBC, pt's hct bumped appropriately
and remained stable.  After ~48 hours of stable hct, pt was
discharged home.
.
# Myeloproliferative disorder/Imburgia: Pt was treated with ASA
and therapeutic phlebotomy as outpatient.  Held aspirin in the
setting of GIB.
.
# Hypothyroidism: 123 Any St.us TSH checked in 2012-06-18 00:00:00 elevated but free
T4
normal and no outpatient f/u check.  Continued levoxyl 88mcg and
recheck TSH, free T4 as outpatient.
.
# HTN: Pt was hypertensive in the ED and restarted amlodipine on
the floor.  On transfer to UPMCE, amlodipine was discontinued for
relatively low blood pressure. Restarted amlodipine on the day
of discharge as BP was noted to be elevated.
.
# Gastritis/recent [**Doctor First Name 325**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear- PPI UPMCE
.
# UTI: Although pt was asymptomatic, she was treated with three
days of ciprofloxacin.  Ucx was consistent with contamination.
.
# FEN: NPO with IVF and started clears and advanced diet to
cardiac diet once hct stabilized.
.
# PPX: Pneumoboots, PPI.
