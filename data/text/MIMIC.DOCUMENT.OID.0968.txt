History of Present Illness:
Mr. Davignon is a 56 y/o AA M w/h/o NICMP (EF 30-35%), HTN,
dyslipidemia, old LBBB who was initially admitted to UPMCE hospital 2007-04-02 00:00:00 for acute bacterial meningitis.
Blood cultures showed Streptococcus aglacticae, CSF cultures
were negative, though protein and glucose levels were c/w
meningitis. He was initially started ABx w/
vanc/CTX/Amp/Acyclovir was eventually changed to Ampicillin with
a tentative goal of 2 weeks of therapy.
.
He was clinically improving on Rx. However, on 2007-04-02 00:00:00 at
about 9:05 am he had a VF arrest for 3-5min (?) while sitting in
bed, for which he was quickly defibrillated back to SR, received
amiodarone 300mg bolus followed by amiodarone drip. A triple
lumen catheter placed in the right femoral artery and he was
transferred to the ICU for further management. His blood
pressure stabilized with IV fluids. He was otherwise awake,
alert with no further symptoms.
.
He was transferred to UPMCE for futhter management of his VF
arrest. On arrival to CCU at UPMCE, the patient was fully awake,
alert and oriented, afebrile w/ stable vital signs. He denies
any complaints and does not recall the event. Pt confirms above
described history. He denies any history of PND, orthopnea,
exertional dyspnea, cough, edema. He has not been symptomatic
with regards to his heart failure.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Studies-
-Portable TTE (2007-04-02 00:00:00)
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with inferior, septal,
anterior and apical hypokinesis. Basal to mid lateral systolic
function appears preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

-Portable TEE (2007-04-02 00:00:00)
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypo to akinesis of the anterior, septal, and inferior walls.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 35 cm
from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a thin, mobile echodensity within the
right ventricle which may represent a torn tricuspid chord and
is much less concerning for a vegetation [clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]]. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No pathologic valvular regurgitation or vegetations.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction as described
above.

-MR Donelda Davignon W & W/O CONTRAST (2007-04-02 00:00:00)
1. Subtle signal changes at the endplate of L4-5 and enhancement
along the posterior margin of L4-5 disc as well as in the
paraspinal region are suspicious for early changes of discitis.
There is no epidural abscess seen.  Small protrusion in the left
neural foramen at L4-5 is identified, which could be also
secondary to inflammatory changes. This area demonstrates
enhancement.
2. Heterogeneous bone marrow could be related to marrow
hyperplasia from anemia, but clinical correlation is also
recommended to exclude marrow infiltrative process.

-Cardiac MR (2007-04-02 00:00:00):  1. Severely increased left ventricular
cavity size with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the left
ventricular walls except for the lateral wall. The LVEF was
mildly decreased at 40%. No CMR evidence of prior myocardial
scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal global and
regional systolic function. The RVEF was normal at 54%.
3. Severely increased left ventricular mass index with maximal
basal anteroseptal wall thickness of 21 mm.
4. Mild aortic regurgitation. Trace mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonic regurgitation. No significant tricuspid regurgitation.
5. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The indexed diameter of the main
pulmonary artery was normal.
6. Normal biatrial size.
7. Small pericardial effusion.
8. A note is made of bilateral pleural effusions,
small-to-moderate on the left and small on the right. There is a
probable cyst in the interpolar region of the right kidney,
incompletely visualized. Prior outside imaging results may be
useful for further elucidation if available. If prior imaging
results not available, a renal ultrasound is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
9. Unusual appearance of the stomach in the provided images,
which might be artifactual and is unlikely to be of clinical
consequence (as described
above). Correlate with prior abdominal imaging if available.
.
2007-04-02 00:00:00 CXR:
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to prior study obtained on 2007-04-02 00:00:00. The
position of the pacemaker is unremarkable within the limitations
of this study technique. The left PICC line tip is at the
cavoatrial junction. There is a small-to-moderate amount of
pleural effusion, most likely on the left, corresponding to the
fluid seen on the MRI of the chest obtained on 2007-04-02 00:00:00.
Minimalm amount of pleural fluid seen on MRI on the right is
most likely below the resolution of the chest radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  56 year old man with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy,
LBBB, initially admitted to UPMCE hospital 2007-04-02 00:00:00 for
acute bacterial meningitis, transferred to UPMCE after VFib
arrest, s/p ICD placement on 2007-04-02 00:00:00.
.
# Ventricular fibrillation:
The patient was transferred to UPMCE following an OSH Vfib
arrest while being treated for GBS meningitis.  He was initially
loaded on amiodarone, and this medication was subsequently
discontinued.  It was felt that the most likely etiology of his
arrythmia was LBB re-entrant tachycardia, though no arrythmia
was induced while in the electrophysiology lab on 2007-04-02 00:00:00.
Overnight on 2007-04-02 00:00:00, the patient developed hemodynamically
stable supraventricular tachycardia in the setting of acute
urinary retention.  The patient underwent a cardiac MRI and ICD
placement on 2007-04-02 00:00:00.
.
# Bacteremia:
Blood culture from OSH was positive for Streptococcus aglacticae
which was sensitive to Ampicillin and ceftriaxone.  Suspected
source was bacterial meningitis given results of a lumbar
puncture.  ID was consulted and felt that there was no
contraindication to ICD placement given that blood cultures had
been negative for several days.  An MRI of the spine revealed
the possibiliy of discitis, and ID recommended a 6 week course
of ceftriaxone, to complete on 2007-04-02 00:00:00 (2g q12 until 2007-04-02 00:00:00,
then 1g q24 until 2007-04-02 00:00:00).
.
# Nonischemic Cardiomyopathy/Chronic systolic congestive heart
failure.
The etiology of his cardiomyopathy remains unclear.  The
patient's CHF was felt to be stable during his hospital course.
He did require some gentle diuresis but was otherwise euvolemic.
 He was continued on his ACE-I and beta-blocker.  Given his
depressed LVEF, Spironolactone should be considered as an
otpatient.
.
# HTN:   Continued on carvedilol and lisinopril. The patient did
have some orthostatic hypotension, that was felt secondary to
deconditioning.
.
# HLD:  The patient's simvastatin was initially held given
transaminitis. This medication was restarted, and his LFTs
continued to normalize.
.
# Anemia: Unclear etiology at this time.  HIV negative, TSH was
within normal limits.  His hematocrit remained stable and there
was no suggestion of acute blood loss.  Will need continued
work-up/follow-up as an outpatient.  And age-appropriate
malignancy screening should be considered.
.
# Transaminitis:  Most likely secondary to hypotension (shock
liver) during cardiac arrest.  Resolved over time without
intervention.  Simvastatin was initially held, and LFTs
continued to normalize after this medication was restarted.
Other potential etioliges included drug induced transaminitis
from amiodarone.  Kassee Gooderham and HBV, HCV serologies were negative.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  The patient did have some hyperglycemia early
in the hospital course. Hb A1c was 5.6% suggesting this was most
likely secondary to his acute illness
.
# Lower-back pain:  Ongoing since pre-hospitalization, possibly
exacerbated by discitis, well-controlled with prn Oxycodone and
Acetaminophen
.
# Buttock ulcerations:  At home, the patient was treated with
hot packs, and developed several ulcerations on his buttock.
Subsequent to transfer, the patient developed 2007-04-02 00:00:00 additional
small ulcerations.  Wound care was consulted, and recommended
routine wound care. These were not felt to be pressure ulcers,
and the exact etiology is unclear.  These need to be followed as
an outpatient, and if he continues to develop new lesions,
further work-up may be indicated.
.
==================================
Transitional issues-
-Consider Spironolactone initiation given depressed LVEF.
-LFTs, CBC with diff, Chem-7 and ESR and fax to UPMCE clinic noted
on page 1.
-Pull PICC line after com123 Any St.n of antibiotic course on
2007-04-02 00:00:00
-Continue work-up / follow-up of stable anemia, consider
age-appropriate malignancy screening.
-Renal cyst noted on cardiac MRI, further work-up may be
indicated
-Monitor buttock ulcerations for improvement, consider work-up
if more lesions develop

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at UPMCE. You originally went to UPMCE Hospital
on 2007-04-02 00:00:00 with a high fever and diagnosed with bacterial
meningitis. You were slowly getting better when you experienced
an episode of cardiac arrest on 2007-04-02 00:00:00 due to an irregular heart
rhythm called ventricular fibrilation. You were stablized and
then transferred to UPMCE on
2007-04-02 00:00:00 for further management of this irregular heart rhythm.
Several different studies were done on your heart here at the
hospital, and it was decided that a pacemaker with a
defibrilator should be placed to help keep your heart beating at
a normal rate and rhythm. This device was placed on 2007-04-02 00:00:00 and
has been functioning appropriately. Your heart is a bit weaker
than before your admission, but the medications will help. You
are now doing much better and you are ready to transfer to
rehab. You will go to a UPMCE rehab facility for more
physical therapy so that you are feeling stronger when you get
home. Some of your home medications were changed to better help
your heart and control your blood pressure. The Carvedilol has
been increased to 25mg twice a day and the Lisinopril was also
increased to 10 mg once a day. Finally, you will need to
continue your IV antibiotic, Ceftriaxone, so that you receive a
total of six weeks of treatment for the meningitis.
Please weigh yourself at the same time each morning and call Dr.
Davignon if your weight increases by 3 pounds in one day or increases
by 5 pounds in three days.
