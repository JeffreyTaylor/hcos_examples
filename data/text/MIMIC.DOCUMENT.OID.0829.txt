Date of Birth: 1996-03-17 00:00:00 00:00:00       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 57 year old male with
hypercholesterolemia and known coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft in 2013-03-18 00:00:00 with quiescent
disease since then, not requiring sublingual Nitroglycerin;
chest pain either.  He presented with one day of chest pain
that began this morning while putting up wallpaper.  The
patient noted ten out of ten chest pain, substernal chest
pain with no radiation with associated diaphoresis but no
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting.
The patient took three sublingual Nitroglycerin that had
already expired without effect, called Emergency Medical
Services where he received Nitroglycerin spray times two
without effect as well.

At the outside hospital, he was noted to have ST elevations
in leads II, III and F plus reciprocal ST depressions in
leads V1 through V2.  The patient received ReoPro and
Retavase at full dose as well as Nitroglycerin and aspirin at
the outside hospital.  There was no change in his chest pain,
therefore, the patient was transferred to UPMCE.

In the Catheterization Laboratory here, he was noted to have
a pulmonary arterial pressure of 38/21 with a pulmonary
arterial mean of 26.  A PCWP of 19.  All grafts were found to
be open.  The right coronary artery was noted to have a 30%
proximal stenosis and a mid-99% stenosis which was stented.
After catheterization, the patient was made chest pain free.

Note:  The patient may have become transiently hypotensive at
the outside hospital after Nitroglycerin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in 2013-03-18 00:00:00 and 2013-03-18 00:00:00; coronary artery bypass graft in 2013-03-18 00:00:00 where
he underwent three grafts including a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal 1 and saphenous vein graft to D1.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Accupril 10 q. day.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
3.  Lipitor 10 q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Distant tobacco history.  Currently no
alcohol.  He denies drug use.  He is married with four
children and he lives in UPMCE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.7 F.; blood pressure
113/75; heart rate of 76; O2 saturation of 100%.  In general,
alert and oriented times three in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular motions are intact.
Oropharynx is clear.  Pulmonary clear to auscultation
bilaterally, anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities with no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 9.4, hematocrit 35.2,
platelets 174.  INR of 1.4.  Sodium of 141, potassium of 4.4,
chloride 111, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 11, creatinine of
0.7, glucose of 107.

CK 1345.  Arterial blood gases 7.31, 46, 120.

EKG post catheterization revealed elevations in T and F, poor
R wave progression, and T wave inversions in V5 through V6,
II, III and F.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 57 year old male with coronary artery
disease, now with new right coronary artery disease,
plus/minus inferior myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIAC:  Status post right coronary artery intervention.
The patient is now made chest pain free and was
hemodynamically stable.  He was continued on aspirin and
Plavix and ReoPro for twelve hours.  A beta blocker was
started at low dose and his ACE inhibitor was continued.
Fasting lipids were checked and were found to be a total
cholesterol of 114, HDL of 41, LDL of 58 and triglycerides of
73.  He was continued on his Lipitor.  He was continued on
Telemetry and his CKs were cycled and were found to be
trending down.

Nitroglycerin and morphine was avoided given possible right
ventricular involvement.  He underwent an echocardiogram the
next morning which revealed an ejection fraction of 35 to
40%, a normal left atrium and left ventricle and right
ventricle.  Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
mild mitral regurgitation; akinesis in the basal inferior,
mid to distal anterior and apical areas.

He also underwent an electrophysiology consultation in order
to do a single average EKG to assess his sudden risk for
death and this was positive; therefore, as an outpatient he
will complete this work-up by undergoing a T wave alternans
test as well as a Holter Monitor.

The patient was transferred to the Floor on 2013-03-18 00:00:00 and
was doing well.  His beta blocker was titrated up, his ACE
inhibitor was continued, and he was doing well and was stable
for admission on 2013-03-18 00:00:00.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  He will be following up with Dr. Laketha Grisamore.
2.  He will be returning for a T wave alternans test and a
likely electrophysiology study.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol XL 25 q. day.
2.  Lipitor 10 q. day.
3.  Quinapril 10 q. day.
4.  Plavix 75 q. day for a total of nine months.
5.  Aspirin 325 q. day.
6.  Multivitamin.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior myocardial infarction status post stent to the
right coronary artery.
2.  Positive single average Electrophysiology test.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
