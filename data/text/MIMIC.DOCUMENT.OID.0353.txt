HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
right handed African-American woman with metastatic breast
cancer to the brain.  She is status post a resection of the
right cerebellum metastasis by Dr. Daeson Guarniere on 2013-08-06 00:00:00 and was
followed by stereotactic radiosurgery.  Spinal tap was done
in 2013-08-06 00:00:00, but the cytology was negative.  A chest CT
revealed pulmonary metastases and she has been treated with
chemotherapy since 2013-08-06 00:00:00.  The patient developed
symptoms of loss of balance, slurred speech and double
vision.  An MRI was done which revealed cerebellum metastasis
and possible leptomeningeal spread.  A chest x-ray from
2013-08-06 00:00:00 showed an increase in lung nodules.
