Chief Complaint:
Chest pressure x 4d

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left heart catheterization and taxus stent

History of Present Illness:
68 y/o male with a h/o CAD with a LAD stent placed in 2008-07-02 00:00:00 who
was doing well at home s/p cath for approximately one week when
he developed chest pain/pressure, lasting four days before he
came to UPMCE ED.  Pt's ECG was consistent with reinfarction; in
the cath lab, he was found to have an in-stent thrombosis and
was restented and sent to CCU intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to CCU from the cath lab.  He was weaned from
the balloon pump but was unable to tolerate weaning from pressor
drips.  He was similarly unable to be weaned from the vent.  For
4 episodes of V-tach for which he was defibrillated, the pt was
maintained on amiodarone.  Pt's course was further complicated
by acute tubular necrosis, leading to diuretic-refractory volume
overload, for which he was started on CVVHD.  The pt also began
spiking intermittent fevers and had an increased WBC without an
identifiable source of infection despite frequent cultures; he
was placed on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics.  As the pt
showed no signs of improvement in any of his multiple medical
problems and his prognosis for a meaningful recovery from a
cardiac standpoint seemed low, the pt's family decided to
withdraw care and institute only comfort measures.  On 2008-07-02 00:00:00,
CVVH was stopped, the pt's pacer leads were disconnected, the
pressors were turned off, and the pt was extubated.  He became
asystolic, and was pronounced dead at 1630.
