branch and diagonal branch.


History of Present Illness:
75 year old male with history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia
referred by PCP for exercise stress test for symptoms of chest
discomfort with exertion. He reports that he is quite active but
recently has noticed that his walking is limited by left sided
chest pressure that resolves with rest. ETT demonstrated 2-4 mm
horizontal ST segment depressions inferiorly and in leads V4-V6.
In addition, ST segment elevation was noted in lead aVR. He was
also symptomatically hypotensive with lightheadedness. He now
underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed significant
coronary artery disease.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Small LV cavity.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.
AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: TVP. Mild to moderate [2014-04-25 00:00:00+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Mild PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral central regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid valve prolapse
is present.
POST-CPB:
LV systolic function remains unchanged, estimated EF=45%. There
is no evidence of dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on 2014-04-25 00:00:00 where
the patient underwent CABG x 3 as detailed in Dr.Amyriah Musick
operative note.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
