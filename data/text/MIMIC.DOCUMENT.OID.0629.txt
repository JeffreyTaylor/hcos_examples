HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 43 UPMCE nursing
home resident who is Ethiopian speaking with a history of
recurrent inoperable cerebellar astrocytoma with swallowing
dysfunction, weight loss and subsequent functional decline.
The patient had recently pulled out his J tube was refusing
supplement nutrition.  The patient was seen by Dr. Thi who
is his neuro-oncologist two weeks ago and told that he had an
extremely poor prognosis.  He was seen by his primary care
physician Zonna Mann one week prior to admission with a
cough and reportedly wished to spend the remainder of his
life at home.  He is interested in pursuing a hospice.  The
evening of admission the patient was alert and responsive,
but had refused dinner and his evening medications the
123 Any St.us night.  He was found by a CMA at the nursing home to
be unresponsive at 1:45 a.m.  He was transferred to UPMCE and found to be febrile with
a temperature of 104, intubated for airway protection and a
chest x-ray was obtained.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Recurrent inoperable cerebellar
astrocytoma diagnosed 2007-03-19 00:00:00, treated with x-ray
therapy at UPMCE on a Decadron taper.
Recurrence noted on brain biopsy by 2007-03-19 00:00:00.  He had a
subsequent bleed of 2007-03-19 00:00:00, and hydrocephalus
craniotomy and shunt, but is not a candidate for
chemotherapy.  2.  History of aspiration pneumonia.  3.
History of positive PPD with a negative chest x-ray in 2007-03-19 00:00:00
completed six months of INH prophylaxis.  4.  History of
schistosomiasis and Strongyloides while on Decadron.  5.
Diabetes secondary to steroids.  6.  History of herpes
keratitis.  7.  Swallowing dysfunction status post
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy  8.  Hepatitis B
positive.  9.  History of malaria in 2007-03-19 00:00:00 treated with
Chloroquine.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

NPH 6 units q.a.m. and 6 units q.p.m.  3.  Regular insulin
sliding scale.  4.  Acyclovir 400 mg po b.i.d.  5.  Multi
vitamin one po q.d.  6.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.  7.  Pred
Forte ophthalmologic drops OD b.i.d.  8.  Polysporin ointment
one drop to OS b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient came to the US from 123 Any St. in
6/93.  He is separated from his wife and children.  He lived
at 123 Any St..

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 104 rectally.
Blood pressure 120/70.  Heart rate 111.  Respiratory rate 20.
O2 sat 97%.  He was intubated.  His right pupil was deviated
to the right and nonreactive.  His left pupil was 3 mm to 2
mm reactive.  His neck was soft, supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  Heart was tachycardic with no murmurs.  His
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was
soft and nontender.  He was heme negative on rectal
examination.  His extremities were warm and well profuse.
Neurologically he was unresponsive.  He was on a ventilator
with settings of IMV of 600 by 12, 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure
support and 100% FIO2.

LABORATORY:  His white count was 8.4, hematocrit 38.9,
platelets 167.  Sodium 143, potassium 3.7, chloride 105,
bicarb 20, BUN 26, creatinine 1.1, glucose 248.  CT 14.2, INR
1.4, PTT 30.8.  Sputum had 4+ gram positive coxae and 1+
yeast.  His urinalysis was essentially negative.  His
electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at 113, normal axis
and intervals and rate related ST depressions in 1, 2, 3,
AVF, V4-V6.  Chest x-ray had no acute infiltrate.  Head CT
without contrast showed extension of his cerebellar lesions,
but no acute hemorrhage or shift.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with presumptive diagnosis of aspiration
versus other pneumonia.  He was started on Levaquin, Flagyl
and Ceftriaxone to cover both for aspiration pneumonia,
pneumococcus and possibly meningitis.  Vancomycin was added
for better coverage of staph aureus, because the patient was
a nursing home resident.  The patient was not a candidate for
lumbar puncture secondary to his known intracranial mass due
to the risk of herniation.  The patient was continued on
Decadron to prevent swelling from his cerebellar astrocytoma.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and he ruled out with serial
CKs of 21, 49 and 55.  An arterial line was placed in order
to better monitor the patient's blood pressure and obtain
arterial blood gases.  The patient was placed on Protonix for
GI prophylaxis and subQ heparin for deep venous thrombosis
prophylaxis.  He was continued on Acyclovir and his usual eye
drops for herpes keratitis.  He was placed on a regular
insulin sliding scale.

On 2007-03-19 00:00:00 a right IJ line was placed for intravenous
antibiotics and the potential use of pressors.  There were no
complications.  The patient under bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage.  This showed edematous hyperemic
airways, thin, but purulent secretions and right middle lobe,
right lower lobe and left lower lobe consistent with
pneumonia.  On 2007-03-19 00:00:00 the patient had several hypotensive
episodes, which responded to fluid boluses.  On 2007-03-19 00:00:00 the
patient's temperature max was 102.2, heart rate was 79 to
122, mean arterial pressure was 60 to 100, Is and Os were
+2.3 liters, on an IMV of 600 by 10, pressure support 10 and
PEEP of 5, FIO2 .4, respiration rate of 11 to 15, arterial
blood gases was 7.39, 34 and 136.  On 2007-03-19 00:00:00 the patient was
extubated and made DNR/DNI at the request of his wife and
following up his 123 Any St.us requests that he did not want to be
intubated and did not want resuscitation in the event of a
cardiac arrest.  Given the patient's condition on overall
prognosis this was felt to be appropriate.  This was done
with the presence of an Ethiopian interpreter.

On 2007-03-19 00:00:00 the patient continued to have copious thin,
purulent and bloody secretions.  His respirations had become
agonal.  Subjectively he was unresponsive.  Objectively his
temperature was 98.9, heart rate 84 to 110, mean arterial
pressure was 79 to 105, respirations 24 to 31.  His
examination was unchanged.  His white count was 7.7,
hematocrit 32.4, sodium 129, potassium 3.4, chloride 97,
bicarb 23, BUN 7, creatinine .5, glucose 211, calcium 8.2,
magnesium 1.6, phosphorus 2.2.

The patient was made comfort measures only and was started on
a morphine drip 0 to 10 mg prn titrated for patient comfort.
His ex-wife was in the room with him.  On 2007-03-19 00:00:00 at 18:16 I
was called to see the patient for unresponsiveness.  The
patient was found to be breathless, pulseless and without
heart tone, blood pressure or corneal reflexes.  The patient
was pronounced dead at 18:16 on 2007-03-19 00:00:00.  The patient's
private physician and family were notified.  Funeral home
will be 123 Any St..
