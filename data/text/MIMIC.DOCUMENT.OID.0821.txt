Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2006-04-01 00:00:00 Aortic Valve Replacement(25mm Mosaic Porcine Valve),
Mitral Valve Replacement(29mm Mosaic Porcine Valve), Replacement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Fadness is an 81 year old male with known atrial fibrillation
and atrial myxoma for approximately 9 years. Serial
echocardiograms have revealed worsening aortic insufficiency and
mitral regurgitation. He concomitantly has complained of
progressive dyspnea on exertion, 2006-04-01 00:00:00 pillow orthopnea and
worsening cough. Cardiac catheterization in 2006-04-01 00:00:00 showed
normal coronary arteries and an LVEF of 50%. A transesophogeal
echocardiogram in 2006-04-01 00:00:00 confirmed 3+ AI, 3+MR, with a
3x3 centimeter right atrial mass. LVEF was estimated at 65%. In
preperation for cardiac surgery, he also underwent chest CT scan
which revealed a dilated ascending aorta. After extensive
preoperative evaluation, he was admitted for cardiac surgical
intervention.

INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No
mass/thrombus in the 123 Any St. (123 Any St.es) **]  123 Any St.es) **] LAA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the LAA. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline dilated LV
cavity size. Low normal LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid
inferolateral - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Moderately dilated descending aorta Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Moderate
to severe (3+)AR. Eccentric AR jet.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
to severe (3+)  MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify  I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related  complications. The patient was
under general anesthesia throughout the  procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. Mild  spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus  is seen in
the left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more  depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. The right ventricular
cavity is  moderately dilated. The aortic root is moderately
dilated athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.  There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending  thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a right
atrial mass just above the svc inlet.  It is rounded and almost
reaches the interatrial septum. There is a small  pericardial
effusion.
Post Bypass: Perserved biventricular function, LVEF >55%. An
Aortic
bioprostesis is insitu. No AI or AS, no perivalvular leaks. A
mitral
bioprosthesis is insitu, no MR, no MS, no perivalvular leaks. An
prosthetic  graft is seen in the proximal ascending aorta above
the sinus of valsalva. The remaing aortic contours are intact.
There is no longer a right atrial masss or pericardial effusion.
The remainder of the exam is unchanged. All findings are
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

CXR
INDICATION: Shortness of breath.

Right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed with no
pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low, and cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bibasilar
atelectasis and small pleural effusions are again demonstrated.

IMPRESSION: Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural
effusions.

DR. Jessicia Cucolo Fadness


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Fadness was admitted and underwent aortic and mitral valve
replacments, along with replacement of ascending aorta and
excision of atrial myxoma. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from
inotropic support. On postoperative day two, he experienced
oliguria with rise in creatinine. Volume and intravenous fluids
were administered while diuretics and beta-blockers were
initially withheld. He was started on Neosynephrine to maintain
MAPs > 70 mmHg and renal perfusion. His creatinine peaked to 1.7
on postoperative day two. Over several days, his urine output
and renal function improved. Neosynephrine was gradually weaned
without difficulty. Diuretics and beta blockade were gradually
resumed. On postoperative day four, he transferred to the SDU
for further care and recovery. Despite remaining in a normal
sinus rhythm(with first degree AV block)postoperatively,
Warfarin anticoagulation was eventually resumed given his
history of atrial fibrillation and myxoma resection. He
continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and was
eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 9.

His INR was to be followed by Dr Fadness until his return to
123 Any St..
