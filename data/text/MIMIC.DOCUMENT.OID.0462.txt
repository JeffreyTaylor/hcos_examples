History of Present Illness:
Ms. Study is a 66 y/o F with a history of pAtrial Fibrillation
(not controlled on Flecanide/Digoxin; failed Drondedarone) and
h/o AFlutter ablation (2010-12-23 00:00:00) who was admitted for elective PVI.
Patient has been followed by Dr. Chibuike Delasantos and had been on
Flecanide for the past two years, with intermittant palpitation
and RVR on Ambulatory rhythm monitoring.  The patient was also
trialed on Dronedarone and failed treatment in 2010-12-23 00:00:00.
.
Patient was admitted for elective PVI.  During the procedure, it
was difficult to cross patient's intra-atrial septum.  She was
subsequently noted to be hypotensive and was in tamponade.  She
had 300cc of frank blood removed from her pericardium and had
pericardial drain placed.  Patient was given protamine and
procedure was aborted.  Pt received 3.5L IVF and remained
hemodynamically stable post procedurally.
.
In the PACU, patient was intubated and VS are stable.  Patient's
pericardial drain had 125cc blood in it on arrival to the PACU.
On evaluation 45 minutes after arrival to PACU, patient did not
have any further drainage into pericardial drain.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient complains of sharp chest pain,
increased with inspiration to 2010-12-23 00:00:00.  Denies shortness of breath,
nausea. Stated that she has only had lightheadedness and
palplitations associated with atrial fibrillation. Also
complains of shoulder spasms on left side occasionally.  Denied
orthopnea, though she stated that she has difficulty lying flat
at night due to anxiety.

FINAL

Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is a very small
pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. A catheter is seen in the pericardial space.

IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion without signs of
tamponade. Grossly normal biventricular function. Focused study.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2010-12-23 00:00:00, pericardial effusion is new.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done 2010-12-23 00:00:00 at 3:00:00 PM
FINAL

Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No residual pericardial effusion. Mild global left
ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-12-23 00:00:00,
there is less pericardial fluid. Off inotropic therapy, LV
systolic function is not as vigorous.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done 2010-12-23 00:00:00 at 11:58:32 AM
FINAL

Very small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the latest prior study (images reviewed) of
2010-12-23 00:00:00, there is a very small/trivial pericardial effusion.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of 2010-12-23 00:00:00  8:08:30 AM


Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 124 beats per
minute.
Tendency toward low voltage in the standard leads. Poor R wave
progression
in leads V1-V3. ST-T wave changes in leads II, III, aVF and
V4-V6. Compared
to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2010-12-23 00:00:00 the rate has increased
markedly with
similar unchanged ST-T wave changes in leads II, III and aVF
with new mild
T wave inversions in leads V4-V6. These changes may be due to
rate-related
ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o F with a histroy of pAtrial Fibrillation and h/o AFlutter
ablation (2010-12-23 00:00:00) who was admitted for elective PVI, procedure
complicated by pericardial tamponade, now hemodynamically stable
after drainage.

# Cardiac Tamponade / Pericardial Effusion:
The patient underwent an elective procedure for Pulmonary Vein
Isolation for her atrial fibrillation; the procedure was
unsuccessful and was complicated by pericardial effusion and
cardiac tamonade.  A pericardial drain was placed, and the
patient drained 300cc of frank blood.  In the PACU, the patient
had minimal further drain output, and a bedside Echo showed no
further reaccumulation.  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
overnight monitoring, and the drain was removed 4-8hours after
the drain was noted to have no further output.  She remained
hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her hospitalization.
 A repeat Echocardiogram the next morning showed trivial
pericardial effusion.

The patient complained of some pleuritic chest pain after the
drain was placed, for which she was treated with 7 days of
indomethacin 25mg TID.  She also had some soreness in her lower
mid chest from the drain placement which resolved within 24
hours after the drain was removed.  She did not complain of any
chest pressure or shortness of breath.

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.
Patient has been on digoxin and flecanide as an outpatient and
had failed dronedarone.  Patient's PVI was terminated secondary
to procedural complication fo tamponade.  She presented with an
INR of 3.7, so her coumadin was held in the setting of
pericardial effusion and tamponade.  Her coumadin was restarted
the next afternoon after she was confirmed to have no
significant further pericardial accumulation, and her INR was 2.
 She was continued on her home doses of digoxin and flecanide.

Patient was in normal sinus rhythm on presentation and flipped
into atrial fibrillation the following day while being monitored
in the CCU.  While in atrial fibrillation, she reported symptoms
of palpitations and significant anxiety, making it difficult for
her to sleep.  She remained hemodynamically stable in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  Her ventricular
rate responded well to IV diltiazem without dropping her blood
pressures, so she was started on po diltiazem.  Her dose of
flecanide was increased from 75mg UPMCE to 100mg UPMCE.  She was
scheduled for a cardioversion on the morning of discharge, but
her rhythm converted back to normal sinus rhythm on its own, so
no cardioversion was done. She was discharged on the prior dose
of digoxin, the increased dose of flecanide, in addition to
120mg daily of extended release diltiazem.

The patient was discharged on a regimen of coumadin 7.5mg three
times/week and 10mg four days/week.  She will get her INR drawn
on Monday 2010-12-23 00:00:00 at her primary care doctor's office and have
her doses adjusted accordingly. She has a followup appointment
with Dr. Chibuike Delasantos in the UPMCE Electrophysiology Department
scheduled in the next couple of weeks.


#  Depression/Anxiety:
Patient was initially continued on her home dose of clonazepam
at bedtime, then switched to small doses of lorazepam as needed
at bedtime with better effect.  She was discharged on her home
regimen.  She noted that she had been particularly anxious in a
room without good windows in the CCU and was much more satisfied
and calmed once transferred to a room with big windows on the
floor.


# Code Status: Patient was Full Code during this
hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Study,
You were admitted to the hospital after your procedure to
attempt to ablate the part of your heart muscle that causes your
atrial fibrillation.  As you know, the procedure was not
successful, and you experienced a complication of having blood
drain into the sac surrounding your heart.  You had a drain
placed to remove that blood, and you were monitored to make sure
you did not have any further complications.  You were sent home
in stable condition and should follow up with Dr. Chibuike Delasantos as
123 Any St.usly scheduled.

Please have your INR drawn on Monday, 2010-12-23 00:00:00 at your primary
care doctor's office.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Please increase your dose of Flecanide to 100mg twice daily
- Please take indomethacin 25mg three times daily for 3 more
days
- Please START taking Diltiazem ER 120mg daily

Please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments.

Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms
concerning to you.

Followup Instructions:
Please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments.
