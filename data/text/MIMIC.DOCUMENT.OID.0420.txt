HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is as 27-year-old male with
history of schizophrenia and non compliance with medications
who was transferred from UPMCE Hospital as a trauma.  The
patient reportedly ran in front of a car on route 128.  The
patient was walking in the accessory Elige Hietpas of the highway, was
struck by a car that was taking the exit ramp.  This occurred
at a slow velocity.  The patient was found face down with Jessiejames Colna
Hietpas coma scale of 3 and in the prehospital stage was
hemodynamically stable with strong pulses and intact gag
reflex but dilated and fixed pupils.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to UPMCE Hospital and intubated.
He was then transferred to UPMCE for definitive care.  On arrival the patient was found
to have a superficial open head laceration, a left open tibia
and fibula fracture and a laceration to the right upper
extremity.  The patient had received 1 gm of Ancef prior to
arrival in the Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Schizophrenia.  He has not been
compliant with medications and has been increasingly paranoid
per the patient's father.  There is question of a history of
rhythm disorder.

MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Risperdal.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy and left
upper extremity fracture.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at the UPMCE in UPMCE.
Father lives in UPMCE.  The patient smokes and drinks alcohol
but denies recreational drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient initially had a heart rate
of 100, blood pressure 160/94, respiratory rate was
determined by respiratory therapist as he was intubated.  He
was satting 100%.  The patient had a large equalizing
posterior scalp avulsion and forehead laceration.  These were
closed immediately with staples.  His left tympanic membrane
was clear, his right tympanic membrane had a question of
hemotympanum.  His C spine was collared.  There were no
step-offs.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, non distended.  Pelvis is
stable.  There was decreased rectal tone and no gross blood.
He had palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally and an open
fracture at the left shin.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 25.7, hematocrit
43.3, platelet count 310,000, fibrinogen 142.  Urine,
specific gravity 1.032, PH 5.0, 2010-12-26 00:00:00 red blood cells, rare
bacteria.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, CO2 28,
BUN 10, creatinine 1.0, glucose 137, amylase 63.  Serum
toxicology screen was negative.  Urine toxicology was also
negative.  Initial blood gas had PH 7.46, PCO2 40, PO2 287,
bicarb 29.  A trauma series including AP view of the chest,
lateral C spine and AP view of the pelvis were read as
negative.  CT of the C spine showed a linear non displaced
fracture of the pars intraarticularis at C7.  A CT of the
head showed a very small amount of subarachnoid blood seen on
the right tentorium.  CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
showed only a small area of consolidation in the left upper
lobe and bibasilar dependent atelectasis.  There was no
evidence of other injuries.  The left tib fib film showed a
mid shaft comminuted left tibial and fibular fracture.  A
left elbow x-ray was normal.  T spine and LS spine x-rays
were also normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operating
room by orthopedic surgery for repair of the left tibia and
fibular fractures and open reduction and internal fixation
was performed with placement of an intramedullary rod.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring.  In the unit neurosurgery was consulted who
commented on the questionable area of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.  Their recommendation was to load with Dilantin
which was promptly done.  On hospital day #2 the patient was
completely stable.  Spine surgery was consulted for the C7 to
T1 facet fracture who recommended that the patient continue
the C collar for approximately 6 weeks.  The patient was
placed on antibiotic prophylaxis with Ancef throughout his
Intensive Care stay.  The patient was transferred to the
floor on 2010-12-26 00:00:00.  He was seen by psychiatry and followed up
throughout the next several days.  He remained markedly
confused with disorganized speech.  This was initially felt
to be consistent with the schizophrenia although after
several days of evaluation it was determined that this is
likely a component of traumatic brain injury as well.
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI of the patient's
head.  This study showed multiple areas of low signal
insusceptibility images at the Jessiejames Colna white matter junction
indicative of diffuse axonal injury and bilateral frontal
subdural effusion.  There was also a large hematoma seen
which was followed while the patient was on the hospital
floor.  It was determined that the patient would benefit from
a neuro rehab facility.  Case management screened the patient
and placement is currently pending.  The patient was kept on
a 1:1 sitter throughout his entire hospital course.  Physical
therapy followed him for exercises.  His range of motion
instructions at discharge are weight bearing as tolerated on
the left lower extremity.  Dilantin was slowly weaned to off
on 2010-12-26 00:00:00.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 5000 units subcu UPMCE while
the patient is confined to bed.  Risperdal 3 mg po bid,
Percocet 2010-12-26 00:00:00 q 4 hours prn severe pain, Tylenol 1 gm po q 4
hours prn pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post struck by car.
2.  Head trauma with diffuse axonal injury.
3.  Schizophrenia.
4.  Left tibia and fibula fracture status post open reduction
and internal fixation.
5.  C7 facet fracture.
