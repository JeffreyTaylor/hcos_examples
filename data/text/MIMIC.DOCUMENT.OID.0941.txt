Service:  Surgery, Blue Team

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Armato is a 43-year-old
black female with multiple medical problems including a
history of systemic lupus erythematosus and end-stage renal
disease (on hemodialysis).  She was admitted to the General
Surgery Service on 2012-07-30 00:00:00 for a scheduled laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.

She had been admitted for one week prior to this admission to
our service because of nausea, vomiting, and right upper
quadrant abdominal pain.  An ultrasound at that time showed
cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis or biliary
obstruction.  The patient was diagnosed with a gallstones
pancreatitis which was treated conservatively with
intravenous hydration, pain medications, and antibiotics.
That hospitalization was complicated by an episode of shaking
which was suspect for a seizure disorder.  A head magnetic
resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were obtained
which were nonspecific, and she was put on Dilantin;
according to Neurology consultation suggestion.

She did well at home for the four days between the discharge
and this current admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission showed a temperature of 98.6, pulse was 84,
blood pressure was 138/80, respiratory rate was 16, and
oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.  The physical
examination revealed that she was a black woman in no acute
distress.  Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic.  Her
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her neck was
supple without lymphadenopathy.  Her heart had a regular rate
and rhythm with normal first heart sound and second heart
sound, and a 2012-07-30 00:00:00 ejection murmur.  Her abdomen was soft and
nondistended, mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
No guarding, and no rebound.  Her rectal examination showed
no mass and was guaiac-negative.  Her extremities were warm
and well perfused.  There was no peripheral edema.  There was
an arteriovenous fistula on the left arm with a palpable
thrill.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
studies showed a white blood cell count of 5.1, hematocrit
was 35.7, platelets were 135.  Sodium was 138, potassium
was 4.9, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 33, blood urea
nitrogen was 27, creatinine was 8.1, blood glucose was 105.
ALT was 4, AST was 37, total bilirubin was 0.2, alkaline
phosphatase was 69, amylase was 155, lipase was 54.  PT
was 11.9, PTT was 26.8.  Dilantin level was 5.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the operating
room on 2012-07-30 00:00:00 for a scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
intraoperative cholangiogram, and common bile duct
exploration.  She tolerated the procedure well and was sent
to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

Her postoperative stay in the hospital was a prolonged one,
mostly because of her comorbid issues.  On postoperative day
two, she received 2 units of packed red blood cells for
decreasing hematocrit levels.  On the same day, and abdominal
ultrasound was obtained which showed a hematoma in the
surgical bed measuring 4 cm X 8 cm and showed no evidence of
residual stones.

On postoperative day three, she had an episode of flash
pulmonary edema which necessitated a transfer to the
Intensive Care Unit where she was closely monitored for fluid
management.  She returned to the floor one day later.

During the hospital stay, she continued to receive
hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and continued to
complain of abdominal pain, and low energy level, and fevers.
These complaints were essentially remaining as the same
complaints during this entire hospital stay.  Her abdominal
examinations did not change.

Two repeat abdominal ultrasounds done on 2012-07-30 00:00:00 and 2012-07-30 00:00:00
did not show any change in the size of the hematoma.  A CT
scan of the abdomen on 2012-07-30 00:00:00 also confirmed the presence of
the same hematoma without any change in appearance.  A
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography obtained during
this hospitalization again did not show any stones.
Incidentally, both the CT and magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography showed possible pancreatic divisum.
We did not think there was active bleeding, and there was no
radiologic signs such as free air to suggest any infection of
the hematoma.  Below is a review by systems for her hospital
stay.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  She continued to have complaints of
abdominal pain which was nonspecific and somewhat difficult
to localize; although, she sometimes referred it to the
epigastric region.  This pain did not change whether she was
n.p.o. or was taking a full diet.  Her amylase level has a
baseline of approximately 220.  We initially started to
advance her diet, but the amylase bumped up 430.  However,
she remained to have a good a123 Any St.e, and there was no
increase in abdominal pain.  We again made her n.p.o. and
started her on total parenteral nutrition.  Later, we
restarted the oral intake slowly.  Her amylase had stabilized
at her baseline level upon discharge.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Since postoperative day 15, she
continued to spike fevers for several days.  Blood, urine,
and sputum cultures failed to grow any organisms.  Because in
the past hospitalization she also presented with fevers of
unclear etiology, which responded well to steroids, we
increased the prednisone to 30 mg every day.  She remained
more than 70 hours afebrile prior to the day of discharge.

3.  RENAL:  She had dialysis every other day while in the
hospital.  Because of her labile blood pressure, the amount
of fluid removed varied significantly.  She also suffered
from fever, fatigue, and malaise after every dialysis.  In
fact, she has not tolerated hemodialysis well as an
outpatient.  She is currently on a list for renal transplant.

4.  PAIN:  There was a long history of chronic pain.  The
patient relayed that her chest/abdominal pain since she had
video-assisted thoracic surgery biopsy of her lungs several
years ago.  Although she had an outpatient appointment with
the Pain Clinic, she was not compliant.  Before discharge,
she was started on gabapentin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s.; according
to the Pain Service suggestions.  She also received thoracic
nerve blocks from the Pain Clinic and received a TENS unit.
She was to follow up with the Pain Clinic as an outpatient.

5.  NEUROLOGY:  During the workup of her fever, Neurology was
consulted for the use of Dilantin; which can potentially
cause fever.  An electroencephalogram failed to identify any
abnormalities.  Therefore, according to Neurology
recommendations, Dilantin was discontinued.  She was
discharged to home without any antiepileptic medications.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home without services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cholelithiasis.
2.  Status post cholecystectomy.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was asked to make an
appointment with Dr.Gordean Armato clinic in the next month.  The
patient was also instructed to follow up with the Pain
Clinic, and also with her nephrologist, and rheumatologist.
