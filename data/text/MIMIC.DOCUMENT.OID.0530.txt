History of Present Illness:
57 year old male with history of EtOH and HCV cirrhosis
(genotype 1, treatment-naive) complicated by ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, with most recent EGD in 2011-10-16 00:00:00 showing no varices,
as well as seizure disorder, polysubstance abuse on methadone,
with recent admission for hepatic encephalopathy, now referred
from his PCP's office for hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
He admits that he is often noncompliant with her medications,
and is almost completely reliant on his sister Eshter Hammersmith to
administer them (he can't even say which meds he's on).

His last admission (2011-10-16 00:00:00 - 2011-10-16 00:00:00) was notable for
hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and
encephalopathy. He underwent large volume paracentesis (4.7L),
from which the peritoneal fluid grew GPCs and he was treated
with vancomycin for 48 hours until cultures returned showing one
bottle growing peptostreptococcus (believed to be a
contaminant).  Antibiotics were discontinued at that time and he
had no further signs of infection for the remainder of his
hospital stay. His acute kidney injury was thought to be related
to hypovolemia from overdiuresis, improved with IV albumin. His
hyperkalemia was treated with kayexylate and the hyponatremia
improved with fluid restriction (132 on discharge). His hepatic
encephalopathy resolved with lactlose. He was given
ciprofloxacin 250mg daily for SBP prohpylaxis (given low
peritoneal fluid protein) and spironolactone was decreased from
200 to 100mg + furosemide decreased from 80 to 40mg.

Since discharge, patient has had 3 weekly, large volume
paracenteses (2011-10-16 00:00:00 - 5L, 2011-10-16 00:00:00 - 4.75L, 2011-10-16 00:00:00 - 3L). He was seen by
his PCP today who checked routine labs, which showed K+ of 6.8
along with acute kidney injury (creatinine of  he was referred
to the ED for further management.

In the ED, triage vitals were 96.7 73 109/65 20 97%. He was
AAox3 and without complaints. Labs showed K 6.8, Na 121 (ranging
121-132 in past 20 days) Cr 1.9 (baseline ranging 0.9- 1.8 in
past 20 days) INR 1.7, AST 47 ALT 89 tbili 1.4, Lactate 2.1. EKG
reportedly had no peaked T waves, He was given calcium
gluconate, dextrose + insulin, kayexelate, and 1L IV NS.  His
blood glucose dropped and he started having terrible muscle
cramps, requiring morphine and lorazepam to calm him down.  He
is being admitted to the ICU after he received too much insulin
and concern for hypoglycemia.

On arrival to the MICU, he is awake, oriented, but sleepy.  His
muscle cramps are much improved and he is having lots of
diarrhea.  His electrolytes have started to normalize.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old male with history of EtOH and HCV cirrhosis with
multiple prior hospitalizations for encephalopathy and ascites
requiring weekly paracenteses, initially admitted to the ICU for
stabilization of blood sugars after treatment for hyperkalemia,
transferred to the Liver service for management of his ascites
and encephalopathy. He was started on lactulose and rifaximin
and his encephalopathy cleared. On 2011-10-16 00:00:00 he underwent
paracenteses with removal of 3L fluid. On this admission his
creatinine peaked at 1.9 on 2011-10-16 00:00:00. Home Lasix and Aldactone were
held. On the floor he was given three units of albumin and
creatinine eventually trended down to 1.3. With improvement in
Hammersmith, potassium also trended down. On the day of discharge (2011-10-16 00:00:00)
it was noted to again be elevated at 5.6, confirmed with a value
of 5.3 later in the day. He was given a dose of Kayexylate with
instructions for outpatient lab draw (LFTs and basic chemistry)
on 2011-10-16 00:00:00 and to follow up with Dr. Ethelene Vinar on 2011-10-16 00:00:00.

>> Active Issues:
# Hepatic encephalopathy: Presented with asterixis change in
mental status relative to baseline. MS improved with lactulose.
Infectious workup negative to date with neg Ucx; tap neg for SBP
2011-10-16 00:00:00. Bl cx NGTD. CXR without evidence of PNA. RUQ U/S with
dopplers unremarkable.
.
# Hammersmith: Cr of 1.9 on adm. Cr improved with albumin but plateaued
at 1.5. Baseline approx 0.9. Most likely from diuretics causing
prerenal azotemia, especially since improvement after albumin
but DDx also included HRS. Ulytes c/w prerenal etiology with low
Una which may also suggest HRS. Pt given 2 day albumin challenge
without significant improvement in Cr. Diuretics held and pt
will discharged off diuretics and plan for weekly taps for
ascites mgmt. After third albumin dose Creatinine trended down
to 1.5 and remained stable at that level until discharge.
.
# Hyperkalemia: On adm, K 6.8 without EKG changes. Pt given
insulin/glucose in ED as well as kayexalate and hyperK resolved.
Pt initially with muscle cramping on adm, which resolved with
treatment of hyperkalemia. Etiology likely from Hammersmith in
combination with spironolactone and questionable compliance. On
day of discharge 2011-10-16 00:00:00 it was noted to be high at 5.6 and then
confirmed with repeat chemistries in the afternoon. Pt was given
one dose of kayexylate with instructions to go for lab draw on
2011-10-16 00:00:00. Pt is to follow up with Dr. Ethelene Vinar in Transplant clinic on
2011-10-16 00:00:00.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC bump to 12.8 2011-10-16 00:00:00, and quickly normalized.
No clear infectious source.
.
# Hyponatremia: likely from decompensated cirrhosis. Na as low
as 120 and improved with holding diuretics and fluid
restriction.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: plts to 28 on 2011-10-16 00:00:00, improved to 68.
DIC/hemolysis labs suggestive that this is most likely related
to cirrhosis vs low grade chronic DIC.
.
# Hypoglycemia: From insulin given in ED for hyperkalemia.
Resolved. Likely has nothing to do with the degree of his liver
failure, as he does not appear to be in these late stages yet.
Fingersticks stable in ICU.
.
>> Chronic issues:
# HCV and EtOH cirrhosis c/b diuretic-refractory ascites
requiring weekly therapeutic taps, as well as HE: Asterixis and
significant ascites on exam. Receiving transplant work-up as
outpt. Continued cipro 250mg daily for now for SBP ppx. HE mgmt
per above. Consider TIPS for diuretic refractory ascites.
Discontinue diuretics on discharge and proceed with weekly
therapeutic taps for ascites mgmt.
.
# Polysubstance abuse: continue methadone 100

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Hammersmith,

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. You were
admitted because of high potassium levels in your blood and labs
suggestive of decreased kidney function. Your blood sugar
dropped low after you were given insulin to treat the high
potassium levels. You had to be observed overnight in the ICU.
You developed a bit of confusion. We did not find any infections
to explain this. We gave you lactulose and you improved.

Please follow-up at the appointments listed below. Please see
the attached list for updates and changes to your home
medications. Please make sure to take lactulose so that you have
2011-10-16 00:00:00 bowel movements daily.

We have stopped the two diuretics below. Please stop taking them
at home:
STOP: Furosemide 40 mg by mouth DAILY
STOP: Spironolactone 100 mg by mouth DAILY

Please have your labs drawn this Friday (2011-10-16 00:00:00) and then
follow up with our liver center in 2 weeks as below.
