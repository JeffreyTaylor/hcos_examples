Studies:

CT Head 2014-04-23 00:00:00
Large intraventricular hemorrhage with interval worsening and
greater mass effect on third ventricle. CTA of the head appears
unremarkable.
.
CT head 2014-04-23 00:00:00
Extensive left-sided intraventricular hemorrhage with a small
amount of hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle, similar in
distribution to the prior examination. There may be slight
interval increase in surrounding edema with 5-mm rightward shift
of midline structures, 123 Any St.usly measured as 4 mm. Pl. see
prior CTA study for vascular details.
.
LENIs 2014-04-23 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either
lower extremity.
.
IVC filter 2014-04-23 00:00:00:
1. Placement of an Option IVC filter, just below the level of
the lowermost right renal vein.
2. The filter is retrievable, and removal should be considered
when the
patient's contraindication to anticoagulation is no longer
present.
.
2014-04-23 00:00:00 Portable abdomen:
IMPRESSION: IVC filter in the expected infrarenal location. No
evidence of
bowel obstruction.
.
Patient has had more than 30 chest X-rays, below is most recent
(2014-04-23 00:00:00):
FINDINGS: The right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Tracheostomy
is noted.
There is minimal if any change from 2014-04-23 00:00:00. There is
persistent
cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular
congestion, greater on the left. No focal consolidation is seen,
though an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 83 year old Arabic speaking male with multiple
medical problems including dementia, HTN, COPD, GERD, BPH,
osteoporosis, CKD, prior GI bleed secondary to ulcer 2014-04-23 00:00:00 and
prior right total hip replacement who presented with a right hip
dislocation s/p closed reduction and postoperatively developed a
left sided intracranial hemorrhage and now has been left with
only residual brain stem function and s/p trach, PEG, and IVC
filter who has bounced between MICU and medicine floor for
respiratory distress and recurrent UPMCE-Pneumonias, hypoxia and
mucous plugging. Extensive discussion regarding goals of care
indicate duty to prolong patient's life as long as possible
regardless of quality of life.

# Goals of care: Aidanjames Oakes son Aidanjames Oakes is the healthcare proxy.
After extensive discussion the family clearly states that
withdrawl of care is firmly against both patient and HCP
personal, ethical and religious beliefs. Additionally, the
patient had requested all treatment measures regardless of
outcomes 3 months ago prior to this acute presentation. Goals of
care at this point are to prolong patient's life regardless of
quality, meaningful prognosis and regardless of mental status.
Given goals of care to prolong life at all costs, medical
management was continued in prevention of cardiac arrest. CPR
was discussed with Dr. Ceili Schankweiler and HCP at length, decision that
CPR is not indicated was made and patient's son/HCP was
agreeable to this. HCP continued to push for aggressive care
though realizes futility of some measures. Frequent revisiting
of goals of care continued to confirm goal to prolong life.
Social work, ethics, legal and Geriatrics have all been involved
in this patient's care. Neurology re-consulted and re-evaluated
patient on 2014-04-23 00:00:00, documenting no significant improvement in
neurological status, had lengthy discussion with family
discussing that prognosis for a meaningful recovery is
unfavorable and he is at a risk for both neurological and
systemic complications. Geriatrics chief spoke with patient's
son and daughter extensively, indicating that patient should as
much as possible stay on the medical floor w/ frequent pulmonary
toilet and care, and try to avoid ICU transfer. Family, while
understanding, continues to push for MICU transfer whenever
hypoxia or labored breathing develops. The patient ended his
UPMCE stay in the ICU secondary to respiratory failure. He will
leave for rehabilitation requiring mechanical ventilation.

#. Vegetative state: Secondary to intracerebral hemorrhage with
midline shift. On 2014-04-23 00:00:00 patient was transferred to the
neurosurgical service for lethargy and a right facial droop. CT
head was done and showed a large left IVH.  Patient was placed
in the SICU for close neuro monitoring. All anticoagulation was
held. A CTA was performed which ruled out vascular anomaly. On
2014-04-23 00:00:00 patient's neuro exam improved and the decision to hold
off on surgical intervention was made. His blood pressure was
liberalized and the goal was to keep him greater than 160. Later
in the evening he began desatting due to poor pulmonary status
and it was discussed with son that any interventions would be
high risk and that if he was intubated then he most likely would
not be extubated. Social work was consulted for his son who was
having difficulty coping with the situation. On 2014-04-23 00:00:00 a family
meeting was held to discuss goals of care which was attended by
the ICU team, stroke team, geriatrics team, ethics, social work,
and his son in addition to neurosurgical team. The son voiced
his wishes that everything possible be done for his father even
if it meant eventual trach and PEG and him never leaving the
hospital. Later on 2014-04-23 00:00:00 he was intubated secondary to
paradoxical breathing and required neosynephrine for BP control.
On 2014-04-23 00:00:00 his neurologic exam deteriorated and he was transferred
to the MICU given his multiple medical issues and lack of
indication for surgical intervention. A PEG, trach, and IVC
filter was placed in the MICU, and he has had no neurological
recovery since. Neurology re-consulted and re-evalutated patient
on 2014-04-23 00:00:00, documenting no significant improvement in
neurological status, had lengthy discussion with family
discussing that prognosis for a meaningful recovery is
unfavorable and he is at a risk for both neurological and
systemic complications.

# Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient bounced from
Medicine and MICU a few times secondary to respiratory failure.
VAP with MDR pseudomonas and pan-sensitive Klebsiella s/p
Vancomycin/Cefepime and s/p Meropenem last dose 3/10. Sputum
culture from 2014-04-23 00:00:00 shows Pseudomonas without clinical s/s
pneumonia so more likely colonizer. During his last stay in the
IVU, the patient was in distress again, likely due to another
pneumonia, this time his sputum culture grew Klebsiella and
Pseudomonas, both of which were susceptible to meropenem. He was
treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia, with the last day
of therapy intended to be 2014-04-23 00:00:00. The patient will be
discharged still requiring mechanical ventilation, on CPAP with
50% FiO2, pressure supprt of 12, and PEEP 5.

# Tachycardia, ectopy / non-sustained v-tach: Episodes of A.Fib
with RVR to 150s occasionally. Generally in Sinus rhythm with
rate in 80s otherwise. Occasional episodes of NSVT on floor.
Sinus tachycardia and ectopy likely related to intracranial
process / myocardial irritation. Patient on admission to ICU was
in atrial fibrillatoin with RVR; upon the time of his transfer
to the floor, he was maintained in NSR with rates in the 80s on
both metoprolol and diltiazem PO. Addiionally, he began to alarm
on telemetry for ST elevations in V3 greater than 2 mm; EKG did
not show any obvious distributions of cardiac territory to
suggest MI, and tropinins checked x 2 were stable. In addition,
the family was notified that even if an MI were present, the
risks of heparinization and Plavix loading given his ICH were
too great, and he would not undergo these therapies. The
patient's atrial fibrillation was controlled in the ICU via oral
metoprolol and diltiazem.
.
#. Right hip dislocation- The patient presented with a
dislocated right hip with neurovasular compromise.  On HD#1, he
underwent a successful closed reduction - right dislocated total
hip arthroplasty with constrained component that appears to have
no function with Oakes on 2014-04-23 00:00:00. The patient was on bedrest
until a brace was fit, which occurred on HD#2.  The patient was
restarted on lovenox 90mg SC q12 hours for DVT ppx and due to
lifelong need give prior PEs. The patient was placed on
subcutaneous heparin on prophylaxis doses in the ICU. His
rehabilitation facility can determine which prophylactic form of
heparin works best for them.
.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency- On HD#2 the patient
developed acute on chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary
to poor PO intake following the closed reduction.  The patient
was given IVF, nephrotoxins were avoided, and all medications
were renally dosed.  The patient returned to baseline (1.0-1.2)
shortly therafter.
.
#. Dementia- The patient was noted to have progressing dementia
and was bowel and bladder incontinent at baseline.  He was
having difficulty swallowing solids and was started on
pureed/dysphagic diet on thin liquids.  He was also supplemented
ensure for each meal given poor nutrition status.  He currently
has a PEG tube and is receiving tube feeds.
.
#. Pulmonary Embolus: The patient was diagnosed with his second
PE in 2014-04-23 00:00:00 and was on lifelong anticoagulation with
Lovenox.  Lovenox was held the night before the closed reduction
and restarted after the procedure (Lovenox 90 mg SC Q12H).
Unfortunately, he developed a left sided intracranial hemorrhage
and it was stopped.  An IVC filter was placed and he is
currently on heparin SC at prophylaxis dosing.

# DVT/PE: H/o DVT in 2014-04-23 00:00:00, underwent treatment with 4 months of
lovenox. PE in 2014-04-23 00:00:00 retreated with lovenox 80 mg UPMCE. IVC
filter placed on 2014-04-23 00:00:00. Patient is at risk of pulmonary embolus
given history and persistant vegetative state though systemic
anticoagulation is contraindicated given recent ICH. Continuing
prophylactic heaprin.
.
#. COPD: Kept on a regimen of fluticasone, albuterol, and
ipratropium.
.
#. GERD: Kept on lansoprazole.
.
#. BPH: Holding home tamsulosin, finasteride. The patient has a
Foley catheter in place and is passing urine.
.
#. Code Status/Aidanjames Oakes With son/HCP, Aidanjames Oakes, who is
constantly present at bedside.  Extensive goals of care
discussions were held with Ceili Schankweiler and he elected to proceed with
PEG, trach, and IVC filter.  His father's poor prognosis has
been communicated with him, but he continues to hope for a
miraculous recovery.  His code status is DNR, but its ok to
place him back on ventilatory support since he has a trach.

regimen of medications:
Albuterol, ipratropium for COPD
Keppra for prevention of seizure
Lansoprazole for GERD
Metoprolol and diltiazem for control of atrial fibrillation and
for hypertension
Heparin for prevention of DVT
Acetaminophen for pain
Artifical tears for comfort of his eyes
Bisacodyl, docusate, polyethylene glycol, and senna for
constipation

Followup Instructions:
