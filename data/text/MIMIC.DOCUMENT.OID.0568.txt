HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old man with
AIDS referred by Dr. Jacquilla Nixt Baggott who has fevers to greater
than 104, likely pneumonia or other pulmonary process
increasing for one month.  He reports increased cough,
usually nonproductive, but occasional production of bloody
sputum.  In addition, he has some dark stool which he states
is maroon in color in the last few weeks as well as nausea
and vomiting.  He states that sometimes he vomits blood.

Patient admitted to the Medical Service.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By system:

1.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was spinal tapped which
was not consistent with meningitis, however, he was treated
empirically with Ceftriaxone and noted to defervesce.
Therefore, Ceftriaxone was continued.  Infectious Disease
Service was consulted.  PO acyclovir and dapsone were
continued.  KUB was obtained which was negative except for a
small amount of pelvic free fluid.  Numerous microbiology
studies were sent.  The only one which was positive was a
sputum that grew out aspergilloses fumigatus.  Blood
cultures, urine cultures were negative.  Ova and parasites
was negative.  Stool ova and parasites was negative.  Stool
culture for yersinia, Campylobacter, E. Coli, vibrio,
cryptococcus, Giardia were all negative.  RPR was negative.
Sputum ova and parasites was negative.  Toxicology IgG was
negative.  Cryptococcus antigen was negative.  Sputum for
acid fast bacilli times three were negative, however, patient
was isolated respiratory until this was obtained.  The
cerebrospinal fluid from 2012-10-27 00:00:00 grew one colony on one
plate of ..... bacterium which was .......this was thought
most likely to be contaminant.  Patient was continued on
ceftriaxone as he defervesced and remained afebrile.  Also
continued on dapsone and acyclovir, however, his white count
was noted to drop and the acyclovir was decreased and then
stopped.  However, after stopping the acyclovir, the patient
noted increase in rectal burning and the acyclovir was
restarted given the patient's history of herpes and the
patient was put on neutropenic precautions.  The patient was
not restarted on HAART during this acute period as he had
been off it 123 Any St.usly.

On 2012-10-27 00:00:00, a chest CT was obtained which showed a 1.8 x
1.5 cm cavitary lesion in the posterior left upper lobe
surrounded by consolidation and ground glass opacity, as well
as scattered emphysema.  The patient was started on nystatin
for thrush and over the next couple of days, the diarrhea
seemed to resolve.  The Pulmonary Service was consulted and
on 2012-10-27 00:00:00, the patient underwent bronchoscopy.  BAL grew
aspergillus fumigatus, however, it was negative for PCP, German Baggott
cardia, ova and parasites and acid fast bacilli.  Thoracic
Surgery was consulted to assess whether the aspergilloma was
resectable.  They felt that he would need at least four to
six weeks of treatment before surgery would be a
consideration.  Therefore, amphotericin was started with a
test dose and then at 0.5 mg /kg/IV/q.d.  Gastrointestinal
was consulted given continuing abdominal pain without source,
heme positive, and history of skin ........and patient with
elevated eosinophils on his white count differential.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on 2012-10-27 00:00:00 which
was noted for friability, erythema and congestion in the
antrum consistent with gastritis and abnormal mucosa in the
duodenum, but otherwise normal.  Biopsy was taken.  The
antrum biopsy showed chronic gastritis with focal intestinal
metaplasia.  No active gastritis seen.  Duodenal biopsy
showed no diagnostic abnormalities.  Patient was continued on
Protonix.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  As above.  Multiple stool studies were
sent and all were negative.

3.  Respiratory:  Patient found to have aspergillosis and
started on amphotericin.

4.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  Patient noted to have
a low sodium on admission of 130 felt consistent with
syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.  This resolved
with fluid restriction.

5.  Psychiatric:  Patient continued on Paxil.  It was
discussed with the patient as to whether to have a social
worker or psychiatrist and he declined at that time.  On
2012-10-27 00:00:00, patient was noted to start having nausea and
vomiting.  After that, he was found later in the morning,
after he had tried to get out of bed, next to formed stool
and he was unable to get up at that time.  Head CT was
ordered but before patient was sent for head CT it was noted
that his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s.  Patient
was bolused with one liter of normal saline.  Blood pressure
only responded slightly.  Medical Intensive Care Unit Team
was called and was in the room at bedside.  Patient was
vomiting and curled on his side.  Eyelids were noted to
flutter and subsequently patient noted to become rigid, then
arms came towards chest in tonic-clonic.  Patient was
nonresponsive.  Ativan 4 mg given and Code Team called.
Patient intubated for airway protection and transferred to
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, patient by system:

1.  Neurologic:  He was loaded on Dilantin.  First lumbar
puncture showed protein of 524. Other cultures and cytology
were negative.  He was on acyclovir until HSV, PCR came back
negative from cerebrospinal fluid.  MRI was negative.
Patient continued to have occasional gaze deviation and
facial twitching, so, bedside electroencephalogram was
obtained which revealed seizures q. 10 minutes.  He was
loaded on phenobarbital.  He was still having seizures, so
induced pentobarbital coma.  Neurology had been consulted.
Electroencephalogram flat line using pentobarbital for 72
hours.  During this time, he developed central diabetes
insipidus, spiked fevers with negative cultures, which was
suspicious for ..........dysregulation.  The second lumbar
puncture showed protein of 226.  Patient believed to have
meningitic process, especially active in basilar regions
given central diabetes insipidus and neurogenic fevers of
unclear etiology. Question of whether this might be partly
due to HIV encephalopathy.

After three days from 2012-10-27 00:00:00 to 2012-10-27 00:00:00, pentobarbital
was weaned to off over 24 hours, continuous
electroencephalogram monitoring for 72 hours after started
pentobarbital taper with no signs of epileptic activity on
electroencephalogram.  Bedside electroencephalogram was
discontinued and patient was followed clinically.  He had
occasional eye twitch and facial myoclonus believed not to be
seizure activity.  He was maintained on phenobarbital and
Dilantin, which will be his anti-epileptic coverage for life.
Goal levels are 30 for phenobarbital and 17 for Dilantin.
On the fourth day after pentobarbital was off, patient noted
to have brain stem activity, reactive pupils and corneal
reflexes.  By day seven, off pentobarbital.  He became awake
and alert, though not interactive over the next two to three
days, he became interactive and vocal after extubation,
although not at baseline mental status.  He was able to
follow commands sporadically, although confused often and
quite exhausted.  Mental status will be impeded by his high
viral load and his cerebrospinal fluid.  Central diabetes
insipidus resolved but he continued to have fevers, but did
not seem to be infectious.  At the end of his Intensive Care
Unit stay, he appeared to have ICU psychosis requiring a
sitter and Haldol.

2.  Pulmonary:  He was intubated for airway protection.
Initially acidotic during seizure that resolved quickly on
assist control while on pentobarbital, and then quickly
weaned to pressure support.  He was extubated with ease after
the mental status improved and he had no problems with
oxygenation or ventilation.  He spent 11 days on the
ventilator during which time sputum became colonized with E.
Coli not believed to be a pathogen, developed bilateral
effusion from fluid overload that resolved with diuresis.
Bronchoscopy after mucus plug, off right upper lobe with
complete collapse.  Plug suctioned at bronchoscopy and right
upper lobe atelectasis resolved completely.  Left upper lobe
aspergilloma remained unchanged per chest x-ray.  Patient was
maintained on itraconazole as amphotericin had to be stopped
after the seizure.

3.  Cardiovascular:  In the beginning, patient was initially
septic appearing requiring pressors.  The need for pressors
increased during the pentobarbital, on dopamine and
vasopressin after the pentobarbital was discontinued,
pressors easily stopped and patient had good blood pressure,
thereafter, echocardiogram was done while in coma with mildly
depressed left ventricular function.  After, out of his coma,
he had no cardiac issues.  He initially developed effusions
from fluids he received but auto drive receptor-like episode
resolved with resolution of the effusions.

4.  Infectious Disease:  Dapsone prophylaxis was continued.
Itraconazole for aspergilloma.  Initially patient on
ceftriaxone, Levaquin, Flagyl because he looked like he might
have gram negative rods sepsis, but when cultures were
negative, the Levaquin and Flagyl were discontinued.  He was
kept on Ceftriaxone to complete a 24 day course.  He was on
acyclovir until HSV PCR was negative, ESBL, E. Coli and
sputum, but no infiltrates, so believed to be a colonizer.
Cultures were always negative even when spiking q.d.
Cultures were drawn q. 24-48 hours so fever thought not to be
infectious.  Renal function was good throughout.  Central
diabetes insipidus treated with DDAVP and matching out's with
resolution of diabetes insipidus. In fact, DDAVP was stopped
completely because he became hyponatremic and then sodium
became normal.  Fluid status and urine osmolarity were
monitored and normal saline or D5 water was given prn.

5. Gastrointestinal:  Initial loss of bowel sounds during the
coma with poor motility that improved with Reglan.  Patient
was put on TPN during the coma, but after the coma, tolerated
tube feeds.  Patient with good bowel movement after the coma.
Patient stable and transferred to floor on 2012-10-27 00:00:00.

This will be his hospital course from 2012-10-27 00:00:00 to
2012-10-27 00:00:00 by system:

1.  Pulmonary:  Patient with aspergilloma, continued on
itraconazole.  02 saturations and respiratory rate remained
stable.  Patient remained on nasal cannula oxygen.

2.  Infectious Disease:  Patient continued to spike fevers
every day.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.
Blood cultures were always negative or pending as were urine
cultures.  Infectious Disease consult Service continued to
follow with the discussion that HAART might be started when
Dilantin was weaned off as the two interacted and could not
be started reliably concomitantly.  Another lumbar puncture
was obtained for question of possible neck stiffness and
photophobia.  That night, tube four had white blood cells, 8
red blood cells, 21 polys, 2 lymphocytes, 52 monocytes, 47 in
tube 1, 7 white cells, 22 red cells, no polys, 71
lymphocytes, 24 monocytes, protein of 46 and glucose of 67.
That night, he got a dose of Ceftriaxone, however, the next
day with review with Infectious Disease Team, it was felt
that this was not consistent with meningitis, and so,
Ceftriaxone was stopped.  Patient was started on Levaquin for
possible coverage of pneumonia as he had some crackles on
exam.  The following day, oxacillin was also started but this
was stopped after one day as LFTs were known to elevate.  At
this time, no source for fevers were definitely discovered.
Patient with nasogastric tube, no nasal drainage or facial
pain to palpation, however, CT at maxillary facial was
obtained and is pending at this time.

3.  Neurology:  Neurology Team continued to follow the
patient.  Dilantin and phenobarbital levels were monitored.
Patient not noted to have any seizure activity.  Patient was
started on Keppra, which will not interact with HAART, and
after several days of this, Dilantin will fully be weaned to
off as Keppra becomes therapeutic.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Patient followed by Nutrition and
continued on tube feeds, tolerating well, hold on starting po
until swallow study.  On 2012-10-27 00:00:00, LFTs were checked and
noted to have risen.  ALT at 57, AST at 176, alkaline
phosphatase at 333, therefore, oxacillin was stopped.  These
may be due both to oxacillin and Dilantin and will be
followed.

5.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  Patient noted to have
drop in his sodium after three water fluid boluses were
increased with his tube feeds.  These were held and changed
to normal saline intravenous for fluid and sodium fully
started to rise.  Electrolytes were monitored and repleted.

6.  Cardiovascular:  Patient noted to be tachycardic, felt
secondary to fevers and possibly dehydration, therefore,
normal saline boluses were given as needed.

7.  Prophylaxis:  Patient was kept on ........and Protonix.
Physical Therapy worked with patient.

Addendum to this dictation will be dictated by new intern,
German Baggott.  This dictation is through 2012-10-27 00:00:00.
