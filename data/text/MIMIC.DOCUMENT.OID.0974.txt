NOTE:  This is an addendum to a dictation done on 2014-11-19 00:00:00.

Since 2014-11-19 00:00:00, the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit,
receiving hemodialysis.  On 2014-11-19 00:00:00, the patient failed a
swallow study.  He was continued to tube feeds through a
Dobhoff.  The patient was continued on hemodialysis and
plans were being made to place a tunneled dialysis catheter.
On 2014-11-19 00:00:00, the patient was placed on Fluconazole for yeast
in his urine.  He was converted to trach mask, which he did
quite well with.

On 2014-11-19 00:00:00, renal decided that given the fall in his
creatinine and his improvement in urine output, he seemed
like he did not need to have hemodialysis.  On 2014-11-19 00:00:00, the
patient's internal jugular Quinton catheter was discontinued
and the plan for a perma-cath was held off on, given the
patient's decreased need for hemodialysis.  On 2014-11-19 00:00:00, the
patient was transferred to the vascular Intensive Care Unit
on a trach collar, tolerating tube feeds.  The patient
continued to do well in the vascular Intensive Care Unit and
his creatinine appeared to get better and better.  On
2014-11-19 00:00:00, his creatinine was 2.2.

The patient continued on his Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Zosyn
and Fluconazole until 2014-11-19 00:00:00 when the Vancomycin and Zosyn
were discontinued.  The patient's Fluconazole was
discontinued on 2014-11-19 00:00:00 after his Foley catheter had been
removed.  On 2014-11-19 00:00:00, the patient was noted to have a
hematocrit of 26, for which he received a unit of packed red
blood cells.

The patient continued to do well on trach mask, tolerating
his tube feeds. He had warm feet.  His right groin wound was
granulating well, was being packed tightly with Kerlix. The
patient was to be transferred to rehabilitation on 2014-11-19 00:00:00.
