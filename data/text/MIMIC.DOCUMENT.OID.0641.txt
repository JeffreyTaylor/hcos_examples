Pertinent Results:
Cath 2008-07-22 00:00:00:
COMMENTS:
1. Access was obtained via the RFA in a retrograde fashion.
2. Resting hemodynamics showed central aortic hypertension with
a 30
mmHg gradient to the RFA, a 15 mmHg gradient to the right
subclavian and
a 100 mmHg gradient to the left subclavian artery.
3. Thoracic Aorta: Type I arch without critical lesions.
4. Abdominal aorta: Mild disease with a modest lesion in the
distal
aorta.
5. RLE: The CIA had a 70% stenosis.
6. LLE: The CIA had no critical lesions.
7. Subclavian artery: The RSCA was normal. The LSCA had a
tubular,
calcified 95% at the origin. There is retrograde flow from the
Adelayne Connolly but
not the vertebral artery.
8. Carotid/vertebral arteries: The RCCA was normal. The ICA had
a 99%
calcified type C lesion. The ICA filled the ipsilateral MCA and
mildly
filled the ACA with competitive flow from the Chantee Egawa. The right
vertebral
artery was small and diffusely diseased. The LCCA was normal.
The Chantee Egawa
had a 95% had a 60% tubular stenosis. The ICA filled the
ipsilateral ACA
and MCA with contralateral filling of the ACA. The left
vertebral artery
was patent without lesions and filled the cerebellar and PCAs
bilaterally.
9. Successful PTCA and stenting of the 123 Any St. with a 6-8 mm
Acculink
stent. Final angiography showed a 10% residual stenosis, no
dissection
and normal flow (see PTA comments).

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: 82-year-old woman with dyspnea and cough.

COMPARISON: 2008-07-22 00:00:00.

FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is widening of
the right
paratracheal stripe. There is a mild interstitial edema. No
focal
consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Osseous structures are
diffusely
demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema.

2008-07-22 00:00:00 ECHO
This study was compared to the report of the prior study (images
not available) of 2008-07-22 00:00:00.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal IVC
diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild (1+) MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated LA pressure.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Frequent atrial premature beats.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2008-07-22 00:00:00, the left ventricular thickness has
increased and the severity of diastolic dysfunction has
worsened.

2008-07-22 00:00:00 RENAL DOPPLER
INDICATION: 82-year-old female with hypertensive urgency.
Evaluate for renal
artery stenosis.

COMPARISON: Abdomen CT, 2008-07-22 00:00:00.

FINDINGS: The right kidney is again noted to be atrophic
measuring only 7.4
cm on today's exam. The left kidney measures 10.0 cm. There is
no
hydronephrosis and no stones or solid masses are identified in
either kidney.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Note is made that the Doppler study is very
technically
limited due to the patient's atrophic right kidney and the
patient's inability
to hold her breath. Color Doppler and pulsed wave Doppler images
were
obtained. In the right kidney, there is arterial and venous flow
documented;
however, spectral waveforms could not be obtained that could be
evaluated for
renal artery stenosis. On the left kidney, arterial waveforms of
the main
renal artery demonstrate sharp upstrokes. Arterial waveforms of
the
intraparenchymal arteries do not demonstrate any measurable
diastolic flow.
This lack of diastolic flow may be due to the technical
limitations of this
study. Appropriate venous flow is identified in the left main
renal vein.

IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis. Atrophic right kidney. No stones or renal
masses
identified.
2. Very technically limited Doppler exam documents arterial and
venous flow
in each kidney, but spectral waveforms cannot be evaluated for
renal artery
stenosis.

2008-07-22 00:00:00 RENAL MRI/MRA
INDICATION: Diffuse severe atherosclerotic disease with diabetes
and multiple
stent placements. Assess for renal artery stenosis.

COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis of 2008-07-22 00:00:00.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the abdomen
were
obtained, including 3D dynamic images obtained prior to, during,
and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1
mmol/kg of gadolinium-BOPTA. Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformatted
images and subtraction images were generated and reviewed on an
independent workstation.

MRA OF THE KIDNEYS AND AORTA: There is a large atheromatous
plaque at the
origin of the right renal artery, which results in severe right
renal artery stenosis. As expected, the right kidney is smaller
than the left in size, measuring about 7 cm in craniocaudad
dimension (an estimate from axial images and slice thickness).
There is cortical thinning of the right kidney as well. In
contrast, the left kidney measures approximately 10.9 cm,
without cortical thinning. There are two left renal arteries,
without stenosis.

The celiac axis demonstrates a severe stenosis just beyond its
origin.
Contrast does not opacifies the proximal most 2.6 cm of SMA
lumen, which could be related to a stent at this locale.
Alternatively, if no stent has been placed in this area, the
finding represents occlusion. There is flow in the SMA beyond
this level. The inferior mesenteric artery is patent. There is
moderate atherosclerotic stenosis of the proximal right common
iliac artery, and severe atherosclerotic stenosis of the
proximal left common iliac artery.

The imaged portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder,
and adrenal glands are normal. There are small rounded
nonenhancing lesions of the left kidney, which are compatible
with cysts. The largest of these is hyperintense on pre-contrast
T1-weighted images, indicating hemorrhagic or proteinaceous
contents. This lesion is in the lower pole of the left kidney
and measures 1.5 cm.

There are several foci of heterogeneous signal intensity in the
subcutaneous fat of the buttocks, corresponding to calcified
injection granulomas as seen on the prior CT of 2008-07-22 00:00:00. There
is an L1 vertebral body compression fracture, mentioned on prior
chest radiographs.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the
anatomy and pathology in this case.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe plaque at the origin of the right renal artery,
resulting in severe right renal artery stenosis. The right
kidney is smaller in size, with cortical thinning.
2. No stenosis of the two left renal arteries.
3. Severe atherosclerotic disease elsewhere within the abdomen,
including
severe celiac stenosis just beyond its origin, a moderate
stenosis at the
proximal right common iliac artery and a severe stenosis of the
left proximal common iliac artery.
4. The proximal superior mesenteric artery is not visualized
over a 2.6 cm
segment, but please correlate to the patient's history. If a
stent is present in this locale, this finding may be
stent-related. If there is no history of stent placement, the
findings are compatible with occlusion. The superior mesenteric
artery demonstrates flow beyond this 2.6 cm segment.
5. Patent Adelayne Connolly.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - The reason for the patient's
decompensation remains unclear, although inadequate thyroid
supplementation may have been a contributing factor. Cardiac
markers were negative x 3. TTE revealed diastolic dysfunction
with preservation of LVEF. The patient was placed on a 750 cc
fluid restriction and given loop diuresis with improvement in
her symtoms. She demonstrated adequate RA oxygenation prior to
discharge. She will be discharged with lasix 20 mg daily, VNA to
check daily weights and BP, and instructions to call her
physician regarding Adelayne Connolly the dose of lasix should she
gain weight or feel subjectively more short of breath.
.
#Orthostatic hypotension - The patient had an episode of
hypotension BP 92/40 upon standing which produced presyncopal
symptoms. Her BP rose to 116/60 after 500 cc NS. Her labetalol
dose was decreased to 100 mg daily.
.
#Acute renal failure - Patient's renal failure was felt to be
multifactorial, resulting from prerenal azotemia in the setting
of overdiuresis, UTI, and gadolinium administration for MRA. MRA
was remarkable for right renal stenosis. Lisinopril was held in
the setting of ARF, and may be restarted at the discretion of
outpatient providers. VNA will draw electrolytes and BUN/Cr two
days after admission, prior to an appointment with Dr. Chantee Egawa
Connolly of Connolly Dept. Nephrology.
.
#UTI - The patient was partially treated for UTI with Bactrim,
but was given only half the prescribed dose. She was given
Bactrim to complete a 7 day course.
.
#Hypothyroidism - TSH was elevated at 17, and the patient's dose
of synthroid was increased from 88 mcg to 112 mcg daily. TSH
should be rechecked in 6 weeks as an outpatient.
.
# HTN - Per recommendations from neurology, patient's SBP goal
was 140-160 to optimize cerebral perfusion. Continued on
nifedipine and labetalol (at a reduced dose as above).
Lisinopril was held in the setting of ARF. MRA revealed right
RAS.
.
# DM 2- Well-controlled on a RISS
.
# Nutrition - Given a low-Na, heart-healthy diet
.
# PPx: SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with extra fluid that built up
because of congestive heart failure. Your symptoms improved with
lasix, a diuretic (water pills). You were diagnosed with a
urinary tract infection which was partially treated with
antibiotics. Please continue taking Bactrim 1 tablet twice daily
for 7 days (through 2008-07-22 00:00:00).

Please begin taking lasix 20 mg once daily. Your labetalol dose
was decreased to 100 mg once daily. Your synthroid was increased
to 112 mcg once daily. Please refrain from taking lisinopril
until you are seen at your follow-up appointment. You may
continue your other medications as prescribed.

Please ensure that your weight and blood pressure are checked
daily. If you gain more than 3 pounds or if you notice that you
are increasingly short of breath, please call your physician
immediately regarding whether you may need to take a higher dose
of lasix. However, all shortness of breath is not necessarily
due to extra fluid, so you may be advised to come to the office
or to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.
