Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents / Ceftriaxone

Attending:Dequawn Brownwood
Chief Complaint:
s/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hip Dynamic hip screw (open reduction and
internal fixation).

History of Present Illness:
Although the pt was responding to questions, a complete history
was difficult to obtain.  The following HPI was obtained from
chart biopsy and son.
.
81 yo chronically ill female with MMP, resident at UPMCE
Nursing Home who presented to 123 Any St. UPMCE Hospital after
falling out of bed.  The pt normally requires assist from two
people for repositioning.  On 2011-12-22 00:00:00, the pt was trying to
get up unassisted and fell out of bed onto her left side.  The
pt was BIBA to 123 Any St. 123 Any St. and was found to have a left
proximal humerous, left proximal femur, left supracondylar knee
fracture, and left rib fracture.  The pt was given dilaudid IV
and fentanyl for pain control with good success as Corddaryl Canup RN
report.  The ECG at NW was NSR at 70, LAD, nml interval, RSR'
in v1, TWI in III and F.
.
Currently patient reports some back pain but is unable provide
any history about the fall or her medical history. Per son, pt
cannot give much history when in pain for sick. She has very
littel functional capcity only to and from wheelchair with
assistance. He denies any hx of MI or chest pain, but she does
have pain all over all the time from her RA.


Past Medical History:
1) Felty's Syndrome (RA, Splenomegally, Granulocytopenia),
Anticardiolopin Ab, multiple DVTs, PEs s/p IVC filter many years

gallstones and 123 Any St.us spine surgery again identified.
IMPRESSION: Likely developing multifocal pneumonia.

mucous debris vs. aspirated content within the right and left
lower bronchi and their segmental branches.This should be
addressed with respiratory therapy.
3) Moderate centrilobular emphysema. Mild subpleural
honeycombing in the mid to lower zone due to background of
interstitial lung disease.This distribution may be due to
connective tissue disease if there is a history of this (Felty's
is mentioned in the request details).Other possibilities would
included interstitial pulmonary fibrosis or drug reaction
depending on the clinical history.
4) Cholelithiasis

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Canup is an 81 yo woman with hx of Felty's syndrome,
osteoperosis, dementia who presented after falling out of bed at
her nursing home with resultant left sided fractures.
.
She was found to have a comminuted oblique intertrochanteric
fracture of the left proximal femur.  The ortho team evaluated
her initially and recommended ORIF of the hip fracture.  While
undergoing pre-op by ortho for surgery, the patient developed
hypoxia secondary to aspiration pneumonia.  Initially, she was
placed on levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin.  Later, she
became progressively more hypoxic and hypotensive.  She was
bolused and given stress dose steroids for hypotension.  The
medical team at that time had a discussion with patient's
family, and because her prognosis was poor, the decision was
made to change her status to Comfort Measures Only.  The family
wanted to discontinue all medications except for the antibiotics
and pain control/comfort meds.
.
About 48 hours later, the medical team noted marked clinical
improvement.  The patient was more alert, blood pressure was
improved, and oxygen requirement decreased.  Her status was
changed back from CMO to DNR/DNI.  Ortho began to evaluate her
again for possible surgery.  She was taken on 2011-12-22 00:00:00 for left
hip dynamic hip screw (open reduction and internal fixation).
After surgery, she remained intubated and was admitted to the
MICU electively for weaning from the ventilator.  Pressors were
also weaned.  She was eventually found to have MRSA and
pseudomonas in her sputum, as well as proteus in her urine.  Her
femoral line was also pulled and proteus grew from tip culture.
Vancomycin was continued for the MRSA in her sputum, and
Meropenem was started for pseudomonal and proteus coverage.
.
She was successfully extubated on 2011-12-22 00:00:00 and was maintatining
O2 saturation well on 70% shovel mask.  She was trasferred from
the MICU to the general medicine service on 2011-12-22 00:00:00.  After
transfer to the floor, she initially became hypoxic to the
mid-80's, which resolved after receiving lasix and nebulizers.
Her course was relatively uncomplicated over the next several
days.  O2 saturation remained in the mid-90's on 70% shovel
mask, and diuresis was continued daily since she was fluid
overloaded peripherally.  Her O2 was weaned to 50% shovel mask.
.
On 2011-12-22 00:00:00, the patient became acutely hypoxic and hypotensive
(SBP=70).  She also had a bloody bowel movement.  She was given
an IVF bolus and nebulizers.  Oxygen requirements again
increased to 70% shovel mask.  At the time, the covering
physicians updated the UPMCE health care proxy with the
changes in her condition.  The patient's family decided to
change her status from DNR/DNI to CMO given her poor prognosis,
and poor quality of life.  Most medications were discontinued
and the patient was made comfortable. The palliative care
service was consulted.  Another family meeting was held with the
Health care proxy (Corddaryl Canup), and the patient's daughter (Corddaryl Canup)
on 2011-12-22 00:00:00.  The family wanted her to return to the nursing
home that she had come from, so the decision was made to wean
her O2 to a level that the nursing home would accept her on.
The family was in agreement on this descision, and reiterated
that they wanted her to be comfortable.  They felt that her
quality of life was poor, and did not want to prolong her
course.  The patient was weaned to 4L NC and remained stable and
very comfortable.  O2 saturation was 95% on 4L NC.  She was
discharged to her nursing home with hospice care on 2011-12-22 00:00:00.
.
.
OTHER ISSUES MANAGED ON THIS ADMISSION:
.
Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has a history of Heparin Induced
Thrombocytopenia. Her platelets dropped slightly while in the
MICU just before being transferred to the floor. It is not clear
why this happened.  Her platelet levels were followed and
remained stable.  She was continued on Fondaparinux for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
Elevated liver enzymes: Her alk phos and total bili were
slightly elevated throughout her admission. This was thought to
be secondary to cholestatsis due to gallstones.  A CXR from
early in her hospital course showed gallstones.  Her
transaminases remained stable, and no intervention was
necessary.
.
Osteoporosis: She was continued on Calcium carbonate and Vitamin
D
.
Hypothyroidism: She was continued on synthroid.
.
Rheumatoid Arthritis: She received stress dose steroids while in
the MICU, and then tapered back to Prednisone 10mg po daily.
