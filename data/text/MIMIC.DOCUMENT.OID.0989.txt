Attending:Dameian Olick
Chief Complaint:
restrained driver high speed mvc
1. Massive chest trauma, avulsion of right pulmonary vein
from the left atrium.
2. Multiple rib fractures.
3. Multiple lung lacerations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
chest tube x 2
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Clamshell thoracotomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Kroeger is a 61 year old gentleman who was a
restrained driver in a high speed, head on motor vehicle
crash. After extrication by report, he was unstable at the
scene and he was brought to the UPMCE emergency room with
hypotension, tachycardia. His initial evaluation
demonstrated right flailed chest with crepitus and decreased
breath sounds. In the emergency room he had a right chest
tube placed after a needle decompression and large bore IV
access. He continued to have hypotension in the trauma bay
and was given 3000 liters of crystalloid and 2 units of
universal blood. A chest x-ray done at that point showed
left hemothorax and a left chest tube was placed. Both chest
tubes put out about 1000 cc blood before the rate of bleeding
slowed down significantly. At this point he again remained
hypotensive. A DPL was performed, which was positive for
blood and he was emergently brought to the operating room for
an exploratory laparotomy.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS PORT)  2009-03-13 00:00:00 12:37 PM

TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS POR

Reason: TRAUMA

INDICATION: Trauma.

ONE VIEW CHEST: Patient is lying on a trauma board, limiting
evaluation. Heart size is within normal limits. The aortic knob
is not well visualized. There is increased opacity in the left
and right hemithoraces. There is a right apical pneumothorax.
Multiple rib fractures are noted on the right. There is
subcutaneous emphysema on the right.

ONE VIEW PELVIS: No evidence of fractures. The hip joints and
sacroiliac joints are well maintained.

IMPRESSION:

1. Right apical pneumothorax.

2. Multiple right rib fractures with associated subcutaneous
emphysema.

3. Bilateral diffuse opacities which may be secondary to
pulmonary contusion. A layering left pleural effusion cannot be
excluded.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  2009-03-13 00:00:00 12:45 PM

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT; -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN

Reason: S/P LINE PLACEMENT

INDICATION: Status post line placement.

PORTABLE AP CHEST:
The ET tube and NG tube are in good position. The NG tube
projects beyond the margin of the film. The right-sided chest
tube is in the right lower hemithorax. There are multifocal
opacities in the right lung indicative of consolidations.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures are noted. The heart size is
normal. There is mild pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION:
1. Irregular opacities in the right lung, right-sided
consolidations could be likely secondary to
aspiration/effusions.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
3. Multiple right-sided rib fractures.
4. Subacute emphysema on the right.
5. ET and NG tube are in good position

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN

Reason: POST MORTEM INSTRUMENT COUNT

INDICATION: Postmortem instrument count.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to a plain film performed two
hours earlier the same day.

AP chest radiograph shows diffuse subcutaneous emphysema as well
as bilateral consolidations throughout both lungs. There is
evidence of multiple sequential rib fractures on the right side
along with flail chest. Two chest tubes are seen within the
right lung with tips pointed towards the right base. Right-sided
central line is seen overlying the area of the SVC. Endotracheal
tube is seen with the tip at the level of the clavicles. A
surgical sta123 Any St. seen in the right neck. A linear metallic
shadow seen overlying the trachea above the level of the
clavicles, possibly representing needle.

AP film of the pelvis shows a left-sided femoral line. No
metallic hardware is identified on this film.

IMPRESSION: Metallic linear structure seen overlying the trachea
above the level of the clavicles, possibly representing a
needle. Surgical staples seen overlying the right neck.

Brief Hospital Course:
(please refer to op note)
Pateitn was taken emergently to the operating room an attempt to
provide cardiopulmonary bypass, The patient continued to
exsanguinate and evaluation of the
injury demonstrated that the right pulmonary veins had
avulsed from the left atrium and that there was massive
defect within the heart. All attempts to control bleeding,
achieve cardiopulmonary bypass and maintain resuscitation.
They were unable to maintain vital signs. After many attempts
to resuscitate, he had no myocardial function, no vitals and
he was pronounced at 3:15 p.m. by the trauma surgery
attending.



Discharge Disposition:
