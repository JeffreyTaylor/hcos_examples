LABORATORY DATA:  Admission WBC 10.4, hematocrit 32.6,
platelet count 195,000; PT 17.8, INR 2.1, PTT 32.8; sodium
132, potassium 4.8, chloride 91, CO2 26, BUN 65, creatinine
4.4, calcium 10.4, phosphate 3.5, magnesium 2.3.

Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia,
pleural thickening/small left-sided pleural effusion and left
midzone atelectases/scarring, unchanged.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
no acute ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
2010-07-05 00:00:00.  She was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Vancomycin was ordered at Hemodialysis and doses when random
Vancomycin level was less than 15.

On 2010-07-05 00:00:00, the patient received fresh frozen plasma in
order to undergo an arteriogram.  The arteriogram showed a
right occluded popliteal artery with reconstitution of the
anterior tibial artery.  Following arteriogram, the patient
had hemodialysis in the afternoon.

The Cardiology Service was consulted for preoperative cardiac
risk assessment.  On 2010-07-05 00:00:00, the patient underwent
Persantine MIBI study which was positive.  On 2010-07-05 00:00:00,
the patient had hemodialysis followed by cardiac
catheterization.  She underwent a stent to her posterior
descending artery vein graft.  She was started on Plavix 75
mg p.o. q.d. for one month.

On 2010-07-05 00:00:00, the patient underwent a right femoral to
anterior tibial bypass graft with PTFE.  Perioperatively she
received a unit of packed red blood cells.

Postoperatively the patient developed atrial
fibrillation/flutter.  The Doppler signal in her right bypass
graft diminished and was lost by late afternoon.  Her toes
were cool and ischemic appearing.

She was taken back to the Operating Room about 6:30 p.m. and
underwent a thrombectomy of her bypass graft.  She was
started on a Heparin drip.  The patient had a warm foot with
a Doppler signal at the right dorsalis pedis.

The Cardiology Service was reconsulted regarding the
patient's new atrial fibrillation.  They noted that her
troponin was elevated to 9.  They recommended decreasing the
afterload with an ACE inhibitor and also increasing her
beta-blocker for rate control.  They recommended
cardioversion if the patient remained in atrial fibrillation.

Midway through hemodialysis on the afternoon of 2010-07-05 00:00:00,
the patient suffered ventricular tachycardia arrest.  She was
resuscitated, intubated and transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  She was treated with Amiodarone drip.
She was extubated the following day.  She was maintained on
her Heparin drip, Plavix, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Cardiology recommended increasing her Aspirin from 81 to 325
mg p.o. q.d.  Intravenous Amiodarone treatment was changed to
oral treatment.

On 2010-07-05 00:00:00, while on Amiodarone, the patient developed
wide complex tachycardia to a rate of 130.  The patient was
asymptomatic.  Her rhythm then changed to atrial fibrillation
and to ventricular tachycardia and then again to atrial
fibrillation.  She had another five-minute run of ventricular
tachycardia.  She was treated with intravenous Amiodarone.

Upon discussion with her primary cardiologist, Dr. Keshanna Kasher
Isenberg, it was decided that the patient was not a candidate
for a AICD.

On 2010-07-05 00:00:00, the patient underwent cardioversion for
ventricular tachycardia.  She was maintained on a Heparin
drip.  She went on to have two more recurrences of
ventricular tachycardia.  She was treated with Lidocaine,
rebolused with Amiodarone, and her rhythm changed from
ventricular tachycardia to atrial fibrillation.  The patient
was asymptomatic throughout her episodes of ventricular
fibrillation.

On 2010-07-05 00:00:00, the patient underwent an electrophysiology
study and ventricular tachycardia ablation which resulted in
normal sinus rhythm.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. was
started.  Coumadin was restarted.  At the time of dictation,
the patient is receiving 1 mg p.o. q.d.  Her INR is 1.9.  Her
goal INR is 2.0-2.5.  The patient's Amiodarone dose will be
adjusted by her primary care cardiologist Dr. Isenberg.

The patient was from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the
Vascular Intermediate Care Unit on 2010-07-05 00:00:00.  She
remained on telemetry until 2010-07-05 00:00:00.  The remainder of
her hospitalization was uneventful.

Physical Therapy assessed the patient's need with transfer
skills.  She required a Keshanna Kasher lift for transfer from bed to
chair initially.

At the time of dictation, the patient's right groin and leg
incision are clean, dry, and intact.  Her foot is warm.  She
has a Doppler signal of her right dorsalis pedis.  Her
staples will be removed, and her incision Steri-Stripped
prior to discharge.  Her Levofloxacin and Flagyl, as well as
Vancomycin will be stopped at the time of transfer to the
UPMCE rehabilitation facility.

The patient will follow-up with Dr. Isenberg in the office
following discharge from the rehabilitation facility.
