Imaging:

1. Increase in interstitial prominence and new development of
small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with moderate
pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are most likely related to
confluent edema, though infection is not excluded.  Repeat
radiography after diuresis is recommended.

Sinus rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality. Poor R wave

Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Hyperacute T

myocardial ischemia.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to the 123 Any St.us

 CXR 2009-07-03 00:00:00
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
   30 year old woman missed dialysis yesterday with crackles and
hypoxia/
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   assess for pulmonary edema



Final Report
PATIENT HISTORY: 30-year-old female who missed dialysis
yesterday.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph
demonstrates a left
subclavian hemodialysis catheter with its tip at cavoatrial
junction.
Compared with 2009-07-03 00:00:00, there is increase in perihilar and
bibasilar
interstitial markings and small bilateral pleural effusions
consistent with
moderate pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged in
appearance. Patchy opacities are superimposed on parasagittal
interstitial
pattern bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increase in interstitial prominence and new development of
small bilateral
pleural effusions consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
Patchy opacities
are most likely related to confluent edema, though infection is
not excluded.
Repeat radiography after diuresis is recommended.
2. Stable appearance of hemodialysis catheter.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
EKG 2009-07-03 00:00:00
Sinus rhythm. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy although may
be
non-diagnostic given patient's age. Delayed R wave progression
may be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy, normal variant or possible prior
anterior wall
myocardial infarction although is non-diagnostic. Inferolateral
lead ST-T wave
changes are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the
123 Any St.us tracing of 2009-07-03 00:00:00 lateral limb lead ST-T wave changes
appear slightly
more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF MICU COURSE:
 MICU Ms. Sower was admitted to the ICU with pulmonary edema
after missing HD.  She underwent HD and UF the day of admission
and had another session of UF on 2009-07-03 00:00:00.  She was hypertensive
overnight and received both IV and PO Labetolol.  After her UF
session on 2009-07-03 00:00:00 her blood pressure was 110s-130s systolic.
She was put on her Lisinopril 10mg daily, Lasix 60mg daily and
Carvediolol 25mg UPMCE per renal recommendations.  She was noted
to have pus coming from her HD line and was given Vancomycin per
HD protocol.  She was cultured from her HD line.  Her
hyperkalemia resolved after UF.
.
FLOOR : 30 YO F w ESRD 2009-07-03 00:00:00 DM1 now with tachypnea, hypoxia and
hyperkalemia in the setting of missing HD. Was admitted to the
MICU intially where she was dialyzed and her fluid
status/tachypnea improved and was transferred to the floor.
.
#Tachypnea, hypoxia. Likely related to missing HD although
initially a  underlying respiratory infection cannot be
excluded. On transfer to the floor she complained of no
tachypnea and seemed comfortable with no complaints. Patient
tolerated room air well and complains of no shortness of breath.
UF recieved yesterday (2009-07-03 00:00:00) with improvement in tachypnea.
Repeat CXR post-UF to eval for clearance on patchy infiltrates
on CXR- showed bilateral parenchymal opacities have decreased in
extent and severity with only a ground-glass like pattern of
opacities seen diffusely throughout the middle and lower lung
zones. Urine/blood /HD entry site cultures-no growth to date.
.
# Hyperkalemia. Likely related to lack of HD. HD with UF as
above . Repeat post-HD-potassium levels were normal  Repeat EKG-
no curent EKG peaked T waves which were present on 2009-07-03 00:00:00 EKG's.
F/u 2009-07-03 00:00:00 EKG - no more peak T waves seen, offical results are
pending.
.
# Hyperglyemia. No gap.
- insulin sliding scale with home regimen- Blood sugars were
initially above 350 however were then controlled under 200-250.

.
# Pus around HD line.-no pus was seen around HD line on the
floors. With no fluctuance, draining fluid, or erythema.
Vancomycin 1.5g with hD per renal fellow- discontinued per
renal. F/u cultures- no growth to date. Bacitracin admin. only
with dialysis to HD entry site recommended.
.
# ESRD.
- continued home meds.Ordered Folic acid home dose. Contnued
Sevelemer 800mg TID per renal.
.
# HTN.   Continued home meds  including home dose lisinopril
daily in addition to already ordered  home dose carvedilol, and
lasix (60mg daily)

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to care for you as your doctor.
.
You were brought to the hospital because of diffuculty
breathing,a high potassium level and having excess fluid in your
system. We felt like this was caused by being fluid overloaded
due to missing a dialysis appointment. You were admitted to the
intensive care unit where you had fluid taken off with dialysis
and were given support for your breathing. After these measures
your breathing and potassium levels improved and you were
transferred to the general floors. We observed you and you were
medically stable to be discharged.
.
We made the following changes to your home medication list:
We added Bacitracin which is a topical antibiotic which should
be administered to your hemodialysis entry site before dialysis.
We added Lasix 60mg daily. This will help keep your body fluid
level appropiate.
.
Please take your other home medications as prescribed before
coming to the hospital.
.
Please follow your dialysis schedule as you were before coming
to the hospital.
.
Please weigh yourself daily and if you gain more than 3 pounds
in one day contact your primary care physician.
.
Please follow up with the following outpatient appointments
