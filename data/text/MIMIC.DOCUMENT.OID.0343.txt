Chief Complaint:
Hematuria, cough, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
85 F h/o stage 0 CLL, not requring tx 123 Any St.usly, presents to ED
for persistent cough/abdominal pain, and hematuria.
.
Pt notes about 2 months of increasing fatigue, nightsweats,
decreased a123 Any St.e, and increasing left side abdominal pain
(intermittent, no relation to food, BM, sharp, no diarrhea,
constipation, melena). She was seen by PCP 2010-02-19 00:00:00, felt to have
viral URI, symptoms persisted, and seen again 2010-02-19 00:00:00 with
persistent cough (intermittently productive, yellow-white),
single episode of hematuria (clear red, not clot), and LLQ
abdominal pain, treated with azithromycin, and abdominal US
obtained which revealed new splenomegaly with new 1.5-cm
echogenic area.

On 2010-02-19 00:00:00, pt noted recurrent episode of "strong blood in urine."
Describes clear red +clots, +feeling incomplete voiding, no
suprapubic pain, no CVA tenderness. Also notes transient R LE
shooting pain last night which has resolved.

Pt presented to the ED with VS: 98.1 79 113/69 16 100%RA. In the
ED, CXR with LUL collapse, CT ABD/PELVIS with multiple new
metastasis, and new mass in bladder. Also RLL PE. UA +hematuria,
+ UTI. pt given levo, flagyl, morphine 2mg x3 for pain. BP then
noted to drop to 70/37, pt received total 2L IVF, although

DIAGNOSIS

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT



FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, FMC-7,
Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens: 3, 5, 10, 19, 20, 23, 38, 45.



RESULTS:

Three-color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield. Lymphocytes comprise <1% of total
analyzed events.

B-cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of clonality.
Approximately 77% of total analyzed events show dim CD45 and
high side scatter, representing neutrophils.



INTERPRETATION

Non-diagnostic study.  Clonality could not be assessed in this
case due to insufficient numbers of B-cells. Cell marker
analysis was attempted, but was non-diagnostic in this case due
to insufficient numbers of cells. If clinically indicated, we
recommend a repeat specimen (fresh) be submitted directly to the
flow cytometry laboratory.

  Atypical but very degenerated urothelial cells, cannot
  exclude urothelial dysplasia/neoplasia.
  A few squamous cells, histiocytes, scattered lymphocytes,
  and many red blood cells.

DIAGNOSIS:



A.  Cell block, "2010-02-19 00:00:00":

Blood and  rare atypical but markedly degenerated urothelial
cells and a few lymphoid cells, see note.



B. Cell block, "2010-02-19 00:00:00":

C.  Cell block, "2010-02-19 00:00:00":

Insufficient material for diagnosis.



Portable AP chest dated 2010-02-19 00:00:00 is compared to the chest CT from
2010-02-19 00:00:00 and chest radiograph of 2010-02-19 00:00:00. Patient respiratory
motion degrades the image. The heart is normal in size; however,
there is marked opacification of the left heart border and
retrocardiac region which may represent
atelectasis/consolidation and pleural effusion. The right lung
is grossly clear, but there is probably a small right pleural
effusion. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. Patient respiratory motion degrades the quality of the image.
2. Left lower lobe opacification likely represents
atelectasis/consolidation plus effusion.

REPORT TO: DR. Lashond Jimeson Kielty

DIAGNOSIS: SUSPICIOUS.

  Atypical but markedly degenerated urothelial cells and
  scattered atypical lymphoid cells present.

  Squamous cells, anucleate squames, red blood cells,
  crystals.

ECHO: Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The gradient increased
with the Valsalva manuever. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular function with mild
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. No significant
valvular disease.

NONCONTRAST CT, (has had recent dye load), please evaluate l

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old woman with CLL admitted with multiple abdominal
mets, and LLL obstruction 2010-02-19 00:00:00 hilar LAD on CT abdomen.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
NONCONTRAST CT, (has had recent dye load), please evaluate
lymphadenopathy, LLL collapse, infiltrate.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATIONS: 85-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, admitted with abdominal metastases and left lower lobe
obstruction secondary to hilar lymphadenopathy on the abdomen
CT.

Question lymphadenopathy, left lower lobe collapse and
infiltrate.

At the request of the referring physician, Fierra Kielty contrast
was not administered because of a recent dye load.

COMPARISONS: Limited comparison to a recent CT of the abdomen
from 2010-02-19 00:00:00 which depicted the lung bases.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest were obtained without
[**Year (4 digits) 3124**] contrast, and coronal and limited sagittal
reformatted images, including the spine, were also performed.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient was
inadvertently imaged during submaximal inspiration/partial
expiration; there is apparently slightly greater than 50%
narrowing of the anteroposterior dimension of the mid trachea,
an appearance suggestive of tracheomalacia.

A coarse calcification is noted the right lobe of the thyroid.
There are calcifications along the right, the left anterior
descending, and the left circumflex coronary arteries. The
pulmonary arteries cannot be assessed for filling defects. There
is only trace pericardial fluid but a small-to- moderate left-
sided pleural effusion of low density is somewhat larger.

Although the left anteromedial basal segment appears spared, all
other portions of the left lower lobe are collapsed, likely due
to post-obstructive atelectasis. The overall degree of
atelectasis has progressed since the prior day.

A large subcarinal mass of 51 x 26 mm in axial dimensions
(2a:27) is now fully visualized, although not as well depicted
without [**Year (4 digits) 3124**] contrast. It can be seen to extend to the
carina and also abuts the posteromedial aspects of each mainstem
bronchus. A large mass along the right infrahilar region and
adjacent portion of the lower left mediastinum measures 61 x 37
mm (2c:74), but was better depicted with contrast. The mass
likely obstructs one or more descending basal segmental airways,
but its 123 Any St.e origin is not fully clear.

There are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. The largest
is a paraaortic node measuring 12 mm in shortest axis dimension.
There is marked lymphadenopathy in the left axilla. The largest
node (2A:97) measures 30 x 23 mm in axial dimensions. There are
also several slightly prominent right hilar lymph nodes, but
these are not over 8 mm in diameter.

A small right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis
appears unchanged. Two calcified granulomas are noted in the
right lung.

Limited views of the upper abdomen again depict multiple masses,
marked lymphadenopathy, a right adrenal mass, and marked
splenomegaly. There are also gallstones and a new small amount
of ascites. This appearance was better depicted on the prior CT
of the abdomen.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Subcarinal nodal mass.

2. Mass in the left infrahilar region with post- obstructive
atelectasis, which has progressed to near left lower lobe
collapse.

3. Marked left axillary lymphadenopathy, amenable to biopsy.

4. Somewhat larger bilateral pleural effusions.

5. Collapsibility of the trachea suggesting tracheomalacia.

6. Coronary artery calcifications.

7. Multiple abnormal masses in the upper abdomen, better
depicted on the recent abdominal CT. The only new finding is
trace ascites.

8. Known pulmonary embolism not visualized given the lack of
contrast administration. The extent of pulmonary emboli,
accordingly, cannot be assessed.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for diverticulitis, signs of C-diff
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: History of CLL with leukocytosis, left upper
quadrant pain, and cough. Additional history from the online
medical record indicates that there is hematuria.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced MDCT of the abdomen and pelvis
displayed in multiplanar collimation.

COMPARISON: 2010-02-19 00:00:00.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is a large 5.6 x 3.2 cm mass in
the inferior mediastinum at the G-E junction. There is a large
4.2 x 1.9 cm subcarinal mass that compressess the esophagus. The
most superior slice also suggests an additional visualization of
a left hilar node, which is compressing the superior segment
bronchus of the left lower lobe resulting in postobstructive
collapse. There is additional atelectasis at the left base with
a moderate left-sided pleural effusion. There is a trace
pericardial fluid. A nonocclusive pulmonary embolism is present
in the visualized portions the right lower lobe pulmonary
artery, partially visualized on this study.

Widespread metastatic disease is identified, with a large, 5.9 x
3.7 cm heterogenous mass in the left upper quadrant, overlying
the spleen, with a small amount of associated ascites.
Innumerable additional omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and
retroperitoneal soft tissue nodules/masses consistent with
metastases are also noted. There is an enlarged 2.7 cm mass/node
in the gastrohepatic space. Multiple metastatic deposits are
noted about and within the right adrenal gland. The spleen is
markedly enlarged measuring 19 cm in long axis and contains
multiple sub- centimeter hypoattenuating, indeterminate lesions.
There is no free air or free fluid. The small bowel loops appear
normal. Multiple hypodense lesions are present in the kidneys,
all probably simple or dense cysts. No lesions are identified in
the liver. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The
gallbladder and pancreas appear normal.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a large lobulated mass within
the right superior lateral wall of the bladder measuring 6.0 x
2.9 cm. There are multiple markedly enlarged lymph nodes along
the right external iliac, right common iliac, and left
paraaortic lymph node distributions. The rectum, colon and
uterus appear normal. The ovaries are not identified without
definite adenexal mass.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lesions are identified. Sclerosis is
noted at the pubic symphysis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Widely metastatic disease with innumerable peritoneal
implants, including a large left upper quadrant mass, and bulky
iliac and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Lobulated mass within the
bladder wall. While a primary bladder malignancy remains a
consideration, other primary neoplasms (such as lung or ovarian)
with implants on the bladder should also be considered.
2. Mediastinal adenopathy with likely left hilar adenopathy
(partially visualized) causing post- obstructive collapse of the
superior segment of the left upper lobe.
3. Nonocclusive pulmonary embolism of the right lower lobe
pulmonary artery.
4. Massive splenomegaly with multi123 Any St.determinate 1-cm
lesions, either metastases or small foci of infarction secondary
to splenomegaly.

[**Numeric Identifier 3125**] INTERUP IVC  2010-02-19 00:00:00 4:14 PM

Reason: please place IVC filter.
Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old woman with CLL, multiple new abdominal masses, new
bladder mass, with RLL PE, with concern for anticoagulation
given hematuria.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please place IVC filter.
PROCEDURE: IVC filter placement.

INDICATION: 85-year-old woman with CLL, multiple new abdominal
masses, and with new bladder mass. Patient has now presented
with right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and with concern for
anticoagulation given hematuria. IVC filter placement was
requested.

RADIOLOGISTS: This procedure was performed by Dr. Fierra and Dr.
Fierra, the attending radiologist, who was present and
supervising throughout the entire procedure.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits
of the procedure, an informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
and the right groin was prepped and draped in standard sterile
fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed.

After injection of local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and using
ultrasound guidance, access was gained into right femoral vein
with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was advanced
into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance and the needle was
exchanged for a 5 French Omniflush catheter. Using Omniflush
catheter and guidewire, access was gained into left common iliac
vein and IVC venogram was obtained. IVC venogram demonstrated no
thrombosis in left iliac, IVC, and both renal veins were noted
at L2 level. Based on these venographic findings, it was decided
to place IVC filter at L3 level.

A 5 French catheter was removed and guidewire advanced into the
upper IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. A 7 French delivery
catheter was advanced over the wire into the IVC. A G2 IVC
filter was advanced through the catheter, and it was deployed in
the immediate infrarenal IVC at L3 level. Final abdominal x- ray
demonstrated proper location and position of IVC filter in
infrarenal IVC.

Vascular catheter was removed and manual compression was held
until hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the
procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Patent IVC and single renal veins at L2 level.
Successful G2 IVC filter deployment in immediate infrarenal IVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o russian woman with history of Stage 0 CLL presented with
cough, abd pain, and hematuria, found to have LUL collapse
secondary to LAD, multiple abd mets, and new bladder mass.

Metastatic cancer of unknown primary
Presented with hematuria, found to have new bladder mass on CT
scan, in addition to peritoneal and lung mass. Urology consult
service followed, recommended urine cytology for diagnosis.
3-way foley placed and clots ultimately cleared and urine
returned to regular color.  Per urology, biopsy of mass not
advisable given risk of procedure (bleeding, poor functional
status). Instead, urine cytology collected (multiple samples),
which were not diagnostic by pathology.  ASA was held.  Patient
was transfused with 1U PRBCs.

Given inability to obtain a diagnosis, and extent of metastatic
cancer (as well as unliklihood it is progressive CLL or
transformation), comfort/palliative care was recommended. Her
oncologist Dr. Lashond Jimeson were
instrumental in decision-making and recommendations for goals of
care and prognosis. Mrs. Kielty was very clear in her desire
to pursue comfort measures only. The main symptoms were pain and
dyspnea both were treated with oxycontin and oxycodone. On day
of discharge, oxycontin was increased to 20 mg UPMCE. She did not
want to take morphine secondary to 123 Any St.us side effects.
Palliative care team was involved as well and they recommended
starting ritalin, dexamethasone as well.

Constipation - on senna, colace and lactulose. Please give a
dose of lactulose when patient arrives at rehab today(2010-02-19 00:00:00)
as pt had not had a bowel movement in 2 days.

LLL collapse/possible post-obstructive pneumonia: was treated
for pneumonia with antibiotics that were stopped when patient
requested they be discontinued. O2 continued for comfort.

Pulmonary embolism: IVC filter placed 2010-02-19 00:00:00.  Systemic
anticoagulation deferred in setting of hematuria.

Leg edema is likely from IVC filter and abdominal metastases
compressing on the venous return. Leg elevation recommended.

CLL/hemolytic anemia: The patient's labs showed evidence of a
hemolytic anemia.  Prednisone was not administered given stable
hematocrit and risk of steroids with unknown malignancy, on
recommendations of Dr. Lashond Jimeson. (However, eventually dexamethasone
was started per palliative care recommendations.)

Celexa, klonapin continued at home doses.

Son, Fierra Kielty (Fierra Kielty Kopelev h-test@mail.com, cell test@mail.com.)
is the proxy and aware of all issues. constant communication was
maintained with him during the hospital stay.

Patient will be discharged to rehab with hospice support.
