Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

None


History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with h/o COPD, CHF sent in by PCP to evaluate
hypoxemia.  His baseline O2 sat is 92% and he was noted to be
78% RA at his PCP's office and satting in the 86% 4Ln.c. in the
ED.  His CXR with pulmonary congestion and RLL pneumonia.
Patient states for the past week, he has had increasing dyspnea
on exertion and also with some dizziness and nausea with
exertion.  Two days prior to admission, he states he was sanding
floors with his son, wearing a mask and noticed the symptoms to
be more prominent after this.  He was initially admitted to the

.
pCXR 2012-01-06 00:00:00:
1. CHF.
2. Possible superimposed right lower lobe pneumonia.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Increase in mediastinal width and tracheal deviation compared
to 2012-01-06 00:00:00 is probably due to AP technique but suggests
increased aortic caliber. A full PA and lateral series is
suggested when the patient may tolerate this.
.
Abd ultrasound 2012-01-06 00:00:00:
1. Unremarkable abdominal ultrasound with no focal liver
lesions.
2. No evidence of ascites.
3. Pancreas and aorta not well imaged in the midline
.
Echo 2012-01-06 00:00:00:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.3 cm2). The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of 2012-01-06 00:00:00, mild aortic stenosis
is now present.
.
Pa/L CXR:
Mild pulmonary edema and congestion of pulmonary and mediastinal
vessels have resolved since 2012-01-06 00:00:00, small bilateral pleural
effusions are present. It could have been present but
unrecognized on the 123 Any St.us study. Heart size has returned to
123 Any St.. There is a roughly 3-cm wide opacity at the base of the
right lung, which projects over the thoracic spine on lateral
view and could be a mass. The configuration of the trachea
suggests chronic lung disease. There is a severe degenerative
change in the right shoulder.
.
CTA chest 2012-01-06 00:00:00:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
There is more focal airspace disease at the right lower lobe,
which may represent pneumonia, clinical correlation is
recommended.
2. Hilar lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive.
3. Two indeterminate pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe
as described. If the patient has a known malignancy, a one-year
followup is recommended or comparison with prior CT scans. If
there is history of malignancy, then a three-month followup is
recommended.
4. Suggestion of thoracic outlet syndrome, correlation with
history and symptoms is recommended. These findings were
discussed with the intern on call at 7 p.m. on 2012-01-06 00:00:00.


Brief Hospital Course:
80yoM with h/o COPD & CHF presents with hypoxemia and R lower
lobe pneumonia.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Etiology was thought to be
multifactorial, due to decompensated CHF, complicated by RLL PNA
and COPD.  He was initially sent to the ICU for Bipap, diuresis
and anitbiotics, but called out after one day.  He underwent an
echo 2012-01-06 00:00:00, which showed EF of 70%, so likely diastolic CHF.
D-dimer was elevated so CTA chest was performed and negative for
PE.  Two small nodules were noted in the R upper lobe (5mm and
4mm) and need to be followed as an outpatient.  He was continued
on Lasix 20mg IV, Levofloxacin for pna, and standing nebulizers
(Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol).  He was fluid restricted
with strict I/O measured.  He was started on and ACEI for
afterload reduction.  The patient improved symptomatically but
continued to be hypoxic on room air (78%). This improved to low
90s on 2L oxygen.  It was felt that he is likely chronically
hypoxic as he has chronically elevated bicarbonate and
hematocrit.  He was evaluated by physical therapy and felt safe
for home.  It is recommended that he undergo pulmonary rehab.
He will be discharged on lasix 20mg PO daily, Levofloxacin x 6
more days for community acquired pneumonia, and 2L home oxygen
at all times.
.
# CAD: The patient denied chest pain, and there were no acute
ECG changes. Cardiac enzymes showed flat CK and trops, slightly
elevated to 0.03 in setting of hypoxia.  He was continued on his
statin and aspirin.  Stress test was deferred to outpatient as
pt with acute CHF exacerbation.  Addition of a b-blocker was
considered by deferred to his primary care provider.
.
# HTN- he was hypertensive on admission and not on any
anti-hypertensives.  ACE-I was started and BP has been well
controlled on Lisinopril.  Addition of a b-blocker for CHF/CAD
was considered but deferred to his primary care provider.
.
# Dizziness: The patient unable to define "dizziness."  This may
be due to hypoxia or orthostasis. His neuro exam was wnl.  His
dizziness resolved with treatment of his CHF and hypoxia.  He
was cleared by PT for discharge home.
.
# Hyperlipideia: The patient was continued on atorvastatin.
.
# BPH: The patient was continued on Terazosin.
.
# FEN: cardiac diet
.
# PPx: SC heparin, po diet, bowel regimen
.
# Code: Full

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Community acquired pneumonia
2. Congestive heart failure exacerbation
3. COPD


Discharge Condition:
Stable, comfortable.  Requires O2 at all times.


Discharge Instructions:
You have a right lung pneumonia as well as volume overload from
heart failure.  Your oxygen levels were noted to bee too low and
you will therefore require home oxygen therapy.  You should use
oxygen at all times until instructed otherwise by your primary
care doctor.
.
Two small nodules were discovered on your CT scan.  These need
to be followed over time by your primary care physician.  Beasley Hosier is
aware of these nodules.
.
We recommend a stress test to be done as an outpatient to
evaluate your arteries in the heart.
.
Some new medications were started for you: Lisinopril for your
blood pressure, Levofloxacin (an antibiotic) for pneumonia (to
be taken for 6 additional days), and Furosemide (a diuretic) to
be taken every day for heart failure.
.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have
shorntess of breath while using your oxygen, chest pain,
dizziness, or any other concerning symptom.

Followup Instructions:
You have an appointment with your primary doctor, Dr. Hosier
on Thursday, 2012-01-06 00:00:00 at 11:30am.
