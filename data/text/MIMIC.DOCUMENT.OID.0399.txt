Attending:Dushan Ziolko
Chief Complaint:
arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Grochowski is a 63yo M w/hx of CHF (EF 15-20%), s/p ICD
placement, severe TR, DM2, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3-1.8), afib on
coumadin, elevated LFTs, who presented to the ED with chest pain
and L arm pain. By report of wife and patient he has had bad
gout over the past several weeks to months.  Principally this
has been involving his right foot limiting his ability to walk.
In the past few days had increasing right arm pain that patient
thought was also his gout.  Then starting about yesterday,
patient had severe left arm pain at the shoulder and the elbow.
This is ultimately what prompted him to come to the ED.  ROS
notable for +sharp midsternal chest pain with coughing,
non-productive cough, sinus congestion for several weeks,
chills.  Patient denied back pain, neck pain, pain with chewing,
changes to his urine output or other complaints beyond those
noted.
.
Of note, recent medication changes include uptitration of
allopurinol to 250mg PO qday for gout after recent gout flare
2008-05-23 00:00:00.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T101.4 HR71 BP90/42 RR20 100%RA .
Blood pressures dropped to the 70s systolic and he was given 1L
IVF, a CVL was placed and CVP was 13-16.  A R IJ was placed and
after dopamine was turned up to 20mcg/min, he was started on
Levofed and dopamine was weaned down.  He was given Vanc and
Levofloxacin and nothing further due to allergy to Unasyn.  He
underwent non-contrast CT of the abdomen which was grossly
normal. CXR was clear.  A FAST scan in the ED did not show
pericardial effusion, kidneys without hydronephrosis.  Received
3L NS, ASA 325, Vanco 1gram Morphine 4mg IV x1.  Levo/aztreonam
ordered but not given.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient c/o total body pain, and
feeling cold.

wife.  Returned to 123 Any St. this past fall, but came back to US
after severe gout flare of his foot.  No smoking.  He quit
alcohol use, no IV drug use.  He says his diet is generally
difficult because he
feels like any food he eats causes gout flare
.

Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
THREE VIEWS, LEFT SHOULDER: Examination is limited by
nonstandard views as
well as the overlying pacemaker. There is moderate degenerative
change at the acromioclavicular joint with narrowing and
subchondral sclerosis. The
glenohumeral joint appears intact. There is no visualized
fracture.
.
THREE VIEWS, LEFT ELBOW: There is no fracture or abnormal
alignment. There
is no joint effusion. Mineralization is normal.
.
NON-CONTRAST CHEST CT: Imaged thyroid gland is grossly
unremarkable. There
is a left-sided cardiac pacer with the lead terminating in the
right
ventricle. There is also a right internal jugular intravenous
catheter with the tip at the mid-distal SVC. A few subcentimeter
mediastinal lymph nodes with no evidence of lymphadenopathy are
noted. There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy on this
non-contrast study. The aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic
calcifications. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary
arteries are also seen. Heart is enlarged. There is no
pericardial effusion. Bibasilar atelectatic changes and/or
pneumonia, left more than right are noted. Mild emphysema is
likely present. Calcified granulomas in the right lower lobe
(2:46 and 2:30) are noted. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.

NON-CONTRAST ABDOMINAL CT: The unenhanced liver, spleen,
pancreas, adrenals are unremarkable. Small pericholecystic fluid
was also seen on prior study.  Both kidneys are in normal
anatomic location. A focal, somewhat band-like calcification in
the interpolar region of the left kidney is stable since 2008-05-23 00:00:00
2008-05-23 00:00:00. There is a probable 2-mm nonobstructive stone in the
inferior pole of the left kidney (2:74). There is no
hydronephrosis. Abdominal aorta and
iliac vessels demonstrate severe atherosclerotic calcifications
with no
aneurysmal dilatation. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.
Evaluation of
the GI tract demonstrates no evidence of bowel obstruction or
bowel wall
thickening. Tubular blind ending structure in the right lower
quadrant likely represents a normal appendix.

NON-CONTRAST PELVIC CT: The urinary bladder is collapsed and
contains a Foley atheter. Air within the urinary bladder is
likely secondary to
instrumentation. Bilateral small fat-containing inguinal hernias
are seen.  The rectum contains stool, otherwise unremarkable.
Seminal vesicles are symmetric. The prostate gland measures
about 5 cm in transverse diameter.  The urinary bladder wall
thickening may be secondary to underdistension. A few mildly
prominent inguinal lymph nodes are noted. A hypoattenuating
structure measuring 2.3 cm in the right lower abdomen to the
right of the urinary bladder is stable.
  .
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no bony lesion to suggest
malignancy or
infection.
  .
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild emphysema.
2. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid was also seen on prior
study. Please clinically correlate.
2. Probable 2 mm nonobstructive left renal calculus.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 63 year old male with PMH of severe systolic HF with
an EF=25%, afib on coumadin, who presented with hypotension and
found to have questionable adrenal insufficiency in the setting
of a likely gout flare.
.
#. Hypotension:  Possibly due to adrenal insufficiency, given
symptoms of fever, hypotension, diarrhea, high eosinophils,
hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia with low cortisol failed ACTH
stimulation (Grochowski stim 6->10->10).  Confounding factors are that
colchicine causes diarrhea and allopurinol induces
hypereosinophilia.  An abdominal CT without contrast showed no
evidence of adrenal pathology.  Initially, the patient had fever
and tachypnea concerning for septic shock possibly from a
pulmonary source as a possible pneumonia was seen on CT scan.
He did have a normal lactate and no leukocytosis.  Septic
arthritis was considered given prominent joint complaints and
history of gout, although his joint was tapped by Grochowski
and was negative for infection.  He was on vasopressors on
admission, but weaned off over 48 hours.  He was subsequently
normotensive with a normal lactate.  He was started on IV
hydrocortisone in the ICU which was transitioned to oral
prednisone on 2008-05-23 00:00:00.  Grochowski endocrine team recommended a quick
prednisone taper to 20mg on 2008-05-23 00:00:00, 10mg on 2008-05-23 00:00:00, then off on
2008-05-23 00:00:00.  The patient's pressures remained stable off of prednisone
for greater than 24 hours.  Cortisol and free cortisol levels
were sent on 2008-05-23 00:00:00 when the patient was off of steroids for 24
hours and he was sent home on prednisone 5mg daily until he can
be followed up in the Grochowski endocrine clinic.
CMV, HIV, RPR, and TSH were all sent to rule out other causes of
adrenal insufficiency.  HIV, CMV, and RPR negative.  TSH was low
with high free T4 and low T3 attributed to SICU thyroid.  It is
therefore unlikely that the patient is panhypopit.  The patient
said that a PPD placed 3 months prior was negative for Tb.  An
adrenal MRI was considered to rule out hemorrhage while on
coumadin or infection but could not be performed with his ICD in
place.
.
#.  Gout: The patient redeveloped right ankle swelling and pain
on 2008-05-23 00:00:00 in the setting of decreasing his prednisone from 20mg to
10mg.  Allopurinol was continued and he was restarted on daily
colchicine.  His uric acid level was 5.8 on 2008-05-23 00:00:00.  Colchicine
was restarted with a 1.2mg dose followed by 0.6 mg dose on 2008-05-23 00:00:00.
 He was started on low dose prednisone 5mg daily both to prevent
gout and hypotension (from possible adrenal insufficiency) until
he follows up as an outpatient with endocrinology.
.
#.  Infection/sepsis:  The patient was febrile and admission
blood cultures were growing coag negative staph which was likely
a contaminant.  CT chest on admission showed an opacity that was
read as being consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA.  He received
empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn, vancomycin, flagyl)
in the ICU until 2008-05-23 00:00:00, but they were discontinued prior to
transfer to the floor.  The patient remained afebrile, but
developed a leukocytosis with peak WBC count of 12.3 on 2008-05-23 00:00:00
which was likely secondary to a gout flare as the leukocytosis
resolved after proper gout treatment and no abx.  TTE showed no
evidence of vegetations on valves or hardware.  2008-05-23 00:00:00
tapped his swollen joint in the ICU and it was negative for
infection.  His central line was removed on 2008-05-23 00:00:00 and the
catheter tip culture was negative.  All blood and urine cultures
were negative.
.
#. Hyperglycemia:  The patient initially had poor glucose
control in the setting of high dose steroids. He required an
insulin gtt in the ICU and was started on Lantus/HISS upon
transfer from the ICU.  His sugars improved dramatically as he
was weaned off of steroids and he was discharged on his home
Novolog sliding scale.
.
#. Grochowski: The etiology was likely pre-renal given that his UA was
bland.  His creatinine peaked at 4.2 and improved with IVFs.   A
renal U/S was normal and his creatinine was his creatinine was
back down to his baseline of 1.1 upon discharge.
His home Diovan was restarted on 2008-05-23 00:00:00.  Torsemide was held given
his hypotension and potential to provoke gout flare.  Given his
severe CHF, the torsemide may need to be restarted as an
outpatient.  His ankles did have 1+ edema, but his lungs were
clear on discharge.
.
#. Elevated INR:  The patient's INR trended up to 11.5 on 2008-05-23 00:00:00
requiring vitamin K administration.  The etiology of this rise
was unclear, but may have been secondary to poor PO intake prior
to admission.  His Coumadin dose was decreased to 2 mg daily
before discharge with therapeutic INRs resulting.
.
#. CHF:  The patient has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
EF=25% and severe TR.  Initially, all of his cardiac meds except
for digoxin were held given his hypotension requiring pressors.
He was restarted on his home Diovan 40mg on 2008-05-23 00:00:00 and his
carvedilol 3.125mg UPMCE was restarted upon discharge.  His home
torsemide was not re-initiated given his hypotension and the
potential of triggering another gout flare.  His digoxin level
was low at 0.4 but was not adjusted in the setting of his
fluctuating renal function.  He should follow-up with Dr. Chawn
ans an outpatient for further titration of his cardiac meds.
.
#. Atrial Fibrillation:  His home carvedilol was held initially
given his hypotension, but was restarted on discharge.  His
digoxin level was low at 0.4 but was not adjusted in the setting
of his fluctuating renal function.  He was continued on Coumadin
at discharge after it was initially held for an INR=11.
.
#. Sinusitis: The patient has had several months of sinus
congestion and was started on fluticasone nasal spray.
.
#. Eosinophilia:  His absolute eosinophil count on admission was
about 900 and has been noted in past labs.  This finding was
concerning for malignancy, occult parasitic infection, or
Churg-Dushan Ziolko.  However, his eosinophilia improved with steroids
and ANCA was negative.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to UPMCE for
evaluation of arm and chest pain.  You were found to have
dangerously low blood pressure and were admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit where IV medications were given to keep your
blood pressure up.  Initially, it was thought that your blood
pressure could be low because of an infection.  However, we were
not able to find any source of infection.  Since infection was
not the likely cause of your low blood pressure, we were
concerned that you did not have enough of a hormone called
cortisol in your blood.  Cortisol helps keep the blood pressure
at normal levels, and is secreted by a gland above your kidney
called the adrenal gland.  Your cortisol levels were found to be
low, which made us suspect a problem with your adrenal glands.
In the meantime, your gout began to flare up and you were
treated with colchicine and allopurinol.
.
It is very important that you follow up with UPMCE clinic next
week. Until then, please take 5 mg of prednisone per day, as
prescribed. This dose will make sure that you have cortisol
activity in your system and will thus make sure your blood
pressure stays up.
.
The following changes were made to your home medication regimen:
- You should take allopurinol 200mg daily
- You should take Flonase for your runny nose
- You should change your Coumadin dose to 2mg daily
- You should continue on prednisone 5mg

Please do not take torsemide or spironolactone until instructed
to do so by Dr. Chawn.


Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with all of your outpatient medical
appointments listed below:
.
1. Please call Dr.Chawn Grochowski office tomorrow to set up an
appointment with him this week.   Please keep track of your
daily weights.  You will need to see Dr. Chawn to discuss when
to restart your fluid management medications, torsemide and
spironolactone.
.
2. Please call your PCP, Grochowski. Chawn, at test@mail.com, tomorrow to
set up an appointment.
.
3. The Grochowski endocrine clinic should call you with an
appointment to follow-up the possibility of your adrenal
insufficiency as an outpatient.  If you do not hear from them in
1 week, please call (test@mail.com to schedule an appointment.
