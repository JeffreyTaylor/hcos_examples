Abd Xray 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No foreign object resembling the imaged item is
identified in the radiograph field. Please note that the right
lateral abdomen and the dome of the liver have been excluded
from the field of view.

Chest Xray 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 2010-01-29 00:00:00 through 20:
Moderate left pleural effusion is larger. Small right pleural
effusion
persists, right basal atelectasis is improved. Left lung base is
obscured,
probably severely atelectatic. Heart size is top normal and
unchanged.
Mediastinal veins slightly engorged. No pulmonary edema. No
pneumothorax.
ET tube, left subclavian central venous line, and nasogastric
tube in standard placements.

Chest Xray 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
No pneumothorax. Decrease in left pleural effusion. Bibasilar
retrocardiac
atelectasis. No edema.

Chest Xray 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
Left lower lobe consolidation is improving, probably resolving
atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions probably
unchanged. Right lung grossly clear. Heart size normal. Left
subclavian line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic
veins. Skin staples and drains noted in the upper midline
abdomen and right upper quadrant.

Chest Xray 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
Improvement in left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis

ERCP 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
Contrast extravasation from the pancreatic duct.
Nonvisualization
of the pancreatic duct within the body and the tail.

CT Abdomen 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
No extraluminal contrast identified on non-contrast images.  No
active extravasation on arterial or venous phase imaging.
Large, multiloculated peripancreatic collection with gas and
multiple smaller collections associated with the pancreas. A
medial catheter courses through a portion of the dominant
peripancreatic collection.  The visualized pancreatic parenchyma
enhances normally, however, due to the close association with
the low-density peripancreatic fluid collection, pancreatic
necrosis cannot be excluded. Attenuation of the s123 Any St. vein,
which remains patent

CT Guided Drainage 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
Successful placement of 8 French pigtail drainage catheter into
left
lateral aspect of peripancreatic collection. Overall decreased
size of peripancreatic collection compared to two days earlier
with near resolution of the lateral portion following today's
drainage.

CT Abdomen & Pelvis 2010-01-29 00:00:00:
Slight decrease in peripancreatic collections since 2010-01-29 00:00:00


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Napoleon was transferred from an OSH to UPMCE for
further management of her necrotizing pancreatitis. She was
placed in the SICU and was aggressively resuscitated with IVF
and placed on broad spectrum Abx. She was also noted to have a
markedly elevated INR and was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP.
She was closely monitored overnight and taken to the OR with
Drs. Bryasia and Bryasia Napoleon the next morning. She toleratd the
procedure well and taken back to the SICU postoperatively.

She remained intubated and sedated and on pressors. She came off
her pressors on POD 2, and was extubated on POD 3. She remained
in the SICU until POD 4 when she was transferrred to the floor.

-CVS: Pt rate and rhythm monitored on telemetry.  She has been
persistently tachycardic in sinus rhythm, controlled with beta
blockade which she will continue on discharge to rehab.

-RESP: Incentive spirometry encouraged during hospital stay.

-GI: OR for pancreatic debridement as above, nutrition provided
via J-tube and PO as described below. Post-op constipation
treated with aggressive bowel regimen, which she will continue
as an outpatient. CDiff toxin was negative on 2010-01-29 00:00:00 and 2010-01-29 00:00:00

-GU: Foley catheter was removed 2010-01-29 00:00:00 and pt was able to void
without difficulty. Urine cultures were negative 2010-01-29 00:00:00 and 2010-01-29 00:00:00.

-NEURO: Pain was controlled on the floor with a dilaudid PCA
and, when pt started taking PO, changed to PO dilaudid.

-ACTIVITY: Pt worked with Physical Therapy on the floor.  She
did have pain with activity secondary to her Rheumatoid
Arthritis but was able to walk with assistance.

-F/E/N: Electrolytes were monitored and repleted regularly. Pt
maintained on tube feeds while recovering from surgery.  Diet
was advanced slowly as tolerated and tube feed were stopped when
pt was taking adequate PO.

-ID: Pt was treated with empiric antibiotics post-operatively
until culture and sensitivity data was available.  Her positive
cultures were: Pan-sensitive E.Coli from OR culture of
pancreatic abscess on 2010-01-29 00:00:00, MRSA from IR culture of pancreatic
abscess on 2010-01-29 00:00:00, MRSA on culture from biliary drain on 2010-01-29 00:00:00.
Antibiotic therapy during her hospital stay was as follows:
Fluconazole (2010-01-29 00:00:00); Meropenem (2010-01-29 00:00:00); Cipro(2010-01-29 00:00:00,
2010-01-29 00:00:00-ongoing at d/c); Vancomycin (2010-01-29 00:00:00-ongoing at d/c).  She was
persistently febrile for a period on the floor and was worked up
appropriately.  Blood cultures were all negative. Her symptoms
improved with vanc/cipro and will maintaining her biliary drain
to gravity.

-T,L,D: Feeding jejunostomy, biliary drain, 2x #19 Emorie Ampy drains
were placed in the OR: 1x #19 Emorie Ampy drain was placed in the
pancreatic necrosectomy bed cavity in the lesser sac from the
right side of the abdomen through the omentum where it was
curled up liberally & oversewn w/the omental attachments to the
transverse mesocolon again in order to close down the lesser sac
and contain any leakage from it. 1x #19 Emorie Ampy drain was placed
in the gallbladder fossa by the biliary drain--both intraop
Blakes enter on the right abdomen.  On 2010-01-29 00:00:00 an 8F Napoleon pigtail
drain was placed by IR via left lateral into the pancreatic
necrosectomy bed to further aid in drainage.  The biliary drain
was capped on 2010-01-29 00:00:00 but was uncapped on 2010-01-29 00:00:00 due to fevers.  The
coiled Emorie Ampy in the necrosectomy bed was pulled back by 3 inches
on two occasions and will be slowly withdrawn on future
follow-up visits in order to ensure slow and permanent collapse
of the space. Right-sided PICC line was placed for antibiotics
2010-01-29 00:00:00 and confirmed to terminate in the RA 2010-01-29 00:00:00.
