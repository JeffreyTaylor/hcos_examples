History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 39 year old male, baseline nonverbal with
mental retardation, cerebal palsy, seizure disorder, history of
recurrent aspirations on a modified diet who presented to the ED
on 2005-07-22 00:00:00 from his UPMCE nursing home with seizure x 2 on day of
presentation ( 7 pm, 8:15 pm) with a fever to 102. Status post
seizure, the patient was found to be hypoxic to 89% on RA per
EMS report. His seizure spontaneously resolved. The patient has
a history of multiple aspirations in the past. Allysandra Bourque HCP,
sister, Allysandra Bourque requested no central lines, LP or femoral stick.

.
In the ED, a CXR was obtained which showed no evidence of
infiltrate. His temperature in the ED was 103.8 for which he was
given tylenol. Given a concern for aspiration, the patient was
given vanco 1 gm, ceftriaxone 2 gm, and flagyl. His pulse was
noted to be up to 146, BP 152/98 and he was sat'ing 100@ liters
->96-99% on RA.
.
A dilantin level was checked in the ED and was 12.6. A valproic
acid level was subtherapeutic at 37. He was given 2 mg IV ativan
in the ED given his recent seizure. His WBC was elevated at
12.4. A UA was checked which was negative for signs of
infection. A lactate was checked and was 3.7->4.4.
.
An EKG was checked which showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of
141 bpm. No acute ischemic changes. He received a total of 2
liter IVFs with a net I/O of 1.4 liters positive.
.
The patient is documented as being DNR/DNI and the patient's
sister Allysandra Bourque asked that no femoral sticks, central lines, or
other aggressive measures be pursued. He was admitted to the ICU
given his tachycardia and elevated lactate as it was felt he
would trigger on the floor.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2005-07-22 00:00:00 3:32 AM
Marked scoliosis distors the chest. Right hemithorax is small
and there is some decrease in aeration at the base, either
atelectasis or conceivably effects of recent aspiration.
Followup advised. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement persists,
but heart is normal size. Pleural effusion if any is minimal, on
the right. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 39 year old male with a history of cerebral
palsy, mental retardation, seizure disorder on dilantin, keppra,
and depakote as well a history of aspiration presents after 2
seizures at NH on the day of presentation with fever to 103.8
with ?aspiration on vanco/CTX/flagyl.
.
Plan:
.
# Seizure disorder
- Valproic acid level subtherapeutic at 37. Dilantin level
therapeutic at 12.6. Neurology was consulted and agreed with
continuing current medications at current doses. Seizure likely
in setting of subtherapeutic medications but also may occur in
the setting of infection. There was no evidence of infection.
- Ativan prn for seizure.
- No further seizures during admission.
.
# Fever
- Elevated WBC to 12 from 10 on presentation in the setting of
recent seizure and possible aspiration during event with
transient hypoxia and now RLL crackles.
- Repeat CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia. Fever likely
occurred in setting of seizure or aspiration pneumonitis.
- The patient was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, flagyl in
the ED. These were discontinued shortly after arriving in the
MICU.
- Given IVF in ED.

.
# Hypoxia
- Now resolved. Sat'ing 99% on RA, 100% on 2 liters for comfort.
Likely occurred in setting of aspiration during seizure.

.
# Mental disability
- Continue psych home medications.
.
# History of aspiration
- Maintain aspiration precautions. He was re-evaluated by speech
and swallow with no change in his aspiration risk/diet. He is on
a modified diet at NH: regular diet, pureed consistent with
honey thickened liquids and yogurt with each meal with 1:1
supervision.
- Aspiration precautions.
.
.
#Code - DNR/DNI

#Dispo - Discharged to UPMCE from MICU.
