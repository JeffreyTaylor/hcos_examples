History of Present Illness:
Mr. Bieler is a 24-year-old gentleman with history of
Bieler Disease, several aspiration events, multiple
admissions for respiratory distress who was sent from UPMCE
rehab for evaluation after being found unresponsive at 3 PM. Per
report, patient was found to open eyes but otherwise not
responding to verbal commands. ABG done at rehab showed marked
hypercarbia (pCO2 100) and patient was referred urgently to the
ED.
.
In the Emergency Department, patient was intubated for presumed
hypercarbic respiratory failure. ABG was not done on admission.
CXR did not show any acute changes from ED visit 3 days prior
(he had presented to ED on 2005-07-19 00:00:00 with dyspnea, respiratory
status had returned to baseline, CXR was unchanged, and labs did
not reveal leukocytosis). He was given Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for
possible sepsis, albuterol/atrovent for bronchodilation, and
methylprednisolone for ? assumed COPD exacerbation given
hypercarbia.
.
In discussing history and events with wife, she noted that
patient appeared more lethargic than normal today, with some
confusion. At baseline, patient is AO x 2, occasionally
disoriented to place and sundowns at night, but otherwise is
able to carry on normal daily conversations with her. During
prior hypercarbic episodes, wife reported that patient's speech
becomes softer and non-sensical, which she reported was
occurring throughout the day today. At 3 PM, she reports that
patient became very somnolent, and she sought immediate

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING: Head CT 2005-07-19 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of the normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. No major vascular territorial infarct is
identified. There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci
consistent with age-related involutional change. Mild
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is
consistent with microvascular ischemia. No fractures are
identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
Admission chest x-ray:
AP SUPINE CHEST: Tip of an endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm
above the carina. The tube could be advanced 2 cm for optimal
placement. A nasogastric tube courses to the stomach, tip off
the inferior margin of the radiograph. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Calcified lymphadenopathy within the
mediastinum is also unchanged. There is persistent bibasilar
atelectasis, left greater than right. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.

IMPRESSION: ETT just below the thoracic inlet. The tube could be
advanced 2 cm for optimal placemtent. Persistent bibasilar
atelectasis.

CXR: 2005-07-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 2005-07-19 00:00:00 through 2005-07-19 00:00:00:

Atelectasis at the base of the left lung has improved. Small
left pleural effusion persists. Right lung is clear. Heart size
top normal. ET tube is in standard placement, although the cuff
is highlighted by retained secretions pooling in the trachea,
while a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
view. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
94M hx aspiration PNA, Parkinsons disease, who p/w unresponsive
episode, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure
.
# HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient with several recent
admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
recurrent aspiration events in setting of neuromuscular
disease/Parkisons, which is presumed to contribute to chronic
CO2 retention.   Initial ABG at UPMCE rehab 7.2/100/60,
pronounced hypercarbia. In reviewing prior ABGs at UPMCE, PCO2s
have been in 60s, with HCO3 in the high 30s, confirming chronic
CO2 retention.  Furthermore patient has restrictive lung
disease. Pt was intubated for several days with notable
secretions. Respiratory failure in this event was due to
multifactorial issues-mucous plugging with excessive secretions,
myositis/muscular weakness from Parkinson's disease and mental
status changes/lethargy from hypercarbia. Given that he has
multiple admission for respiratory failure, a tracheostomy was
discussed with the patient, his wife and Dr. Zitlally Kramer his
longtime family physician, Giacomin Bieler agreed to proceed with a
tracheostomy. On 2005-07-19 00:00:00 the IP service placed a tracheostomy, #8
portex trach w/disposable inner cannula. On 2005-07-19 00:00:00 the pt was
placed on trach collar and tolerated it well. He was placed on
ventilatory support for rising PaCO2 in the 70s and placed on AC
overnight with good ventilation and oxygynation. He had a cuff
leak, which was discussed with IP service, if his oxygenation
and ventilation are good, then will tolerate the leak. Plan to
downsize the trach in 2 weeks. Per his insurance he was accepted
back to UPMCE Rehab MACU for ventilatory care and support. If
the MACU can not change the trach, please call test@mail.com, IP
service to change trach. OK to continue with aucapella/chest PT
vest.
.
# UNRESPONSIVE EVENT: Per wife pt gets very obtunded when his
CO2 levels increase, his lethargy and unresponsiveness
corresponded with significant hypercarbia. His mental status
improved markedly as his hypercarbia improved with ventilatory
support. His Head CT was negative for bleed, neuro exam was not
remarkable for gross neurologic insult
.
#. ID:
Line Infection--Pt was noted to have coag neg staph on 2 blood
cultures from 2005-07-19 00:00:00 2 bottled from femoral line that was placed
in the ED. On subsequent blood cultures he had NGTD. He was
treated with a 4 out of 5 day course with Vanco.
.
Klebsiella UTI--UTI noted to be ESBL which was sensitive to
bactrim. He was continued on Bactrim with a 7 day course, he was
due to complete his 7 day course on 2005-07-19 00:00:00.

#. Bradycardia: Patient with multiple types of AV delay, but per
EP does not have Mobitz type II and does not meet criteria for
pacemaker placement.  Therefore, will continue to hold nodal
blocking agents and follow hr.  Of note, patient does not have
hypotenision with bradycardia.

# PARKISONS DISEASE: He was continued on his outpatient
medication regimen of Mirapex, Sinemet, Entacapone
.
# GLAUCOMA: He was continued on his outpatient drops
.
# HTN: His anti-hypertensives were held and BP well-controlled,
some BP decrease while under sedation which resolved when
sedation was removed. His BP meds were not continued during this
hospitalization.
.
#. Nutrition: Pt was resumed on Tube Feeds once his G tube was
changed per GI on 2005-07-19 00:00:00. 2005-07-19 00:00:00 tube was used immediately form meds,
and TF without any problems.
.
# CODE: FULL, wife is having ongoing discussion with Pt's
longtime family physician and the patient regarding DNR.
