History of Present Illness:
57M with AF on coumadin, h/o dvt, CHF, CAD h/o MI, COPD on 4L
home O2, 4 prior intubations for PNA, who presented with 4d of
worsening SOB. He was admitted at UPMCE approximately
5 wks ago for PNA and intubated for approximately 6 days. At
baseline, he takes 160mg Lasix TID. He began to feel short of
breath 4 days prior to admission at UPMCE, with orthopnea, mild
cough with one episode of coughing up brown non-bloody sputum,
and fever to 100 on the morning of admission, with no prior
known fevers. He reports weight loss of 20lb over the past few

a123 Any St.e. He denied any recent sick contact/travel, missed
medication doses, or dietary alterations.
In the ED, initial vs were T 97.6 HR 120 BP 186/103 RR 20 sat
96% 5L. Prior to transfer to ICU vs were HR 108 afib, BP
131/101, RR 15, 95% on 5L. The patient was given
vanco/ceft/azithro (without cultures), nebs, and K re123 Any St.n.
CXR showed cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions R>L, and
RML/RLL opacity concerning for PNA. Given the patient's history,
he was admitted to the MICU for possible airway control and
possible MRSA PNA.

ECG 2011-08-25 00:00:00 Atrial fibrillation 94bpm. Modest low amplitude lateral
lead T wave changes are non-specific. Since the 123 Any St.us tracing
of 2011-08-25 00:00:00 no significant change.
.
CXR 2011-08-25 00:00:00: IMPRESSION: Right mid to lower lung opacity concerning
for pneumonia.  Cardiomegaly with bilateral effusions and
pulmonary vascular congestion also present.
.
Echo 2011-08-25 00:00:00: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of 2011-08-25 00:00:00, significant systolic and diastolic
dysfunction of the left ventricle are now both present.
.
CXR 2011-08-25 00:00:00: Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The
component of the pulmonary edema has resolved. Persistent right
mid and right lower lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia are
unchanged. The lateral CP angles were not included on the film.
Evaluation of pleural effusion included. There is no evident
pneumothorax.
.
Repeat TTE 2011-08-25 00:00:00:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation
of apical setments. (LVEF = 30%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate (2011-08-25 00:00:00+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2011-08-25 00:00:00,
the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure are slightly reduced. Biventricular
cavity sizes and systolic function are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Kochanowski is a 57 yo man with a PMH of AF on coumadin, h/o DVT,
CHF, CAD h/o MI, COPD on home O2 of 4L, h/o of intubation 4 x
during 123 Any St.us admissions for pneumonia, on methadone who
presented with a 4d history of worsening SOB, principally
secondary to CHF.
.
#. SOB: At baseline, the patient has COPD with 4L of 02 at home.
The patient required approximately the same amount of 02 during
the ICU and floor course. The shortness of breath was likely
multifactorial, with CHF as the major contributor.  His SOB and
CXR improved with diuresis.  He was put on vanc/levo on
admission, which was discontinued on 2011-08-25 00:00:00 after a 5d course.
The consulting pulmonary team did not feel that he had
pneumonia.  He received nebs and bi-pap in house.
.
#. Diastolic and systolic CHF: The patient was taking furosemide
160 mg TID at home. The patient has had difficulty with fluid
overload in the past.  Pro-BNP was 6217.  On admission, he had a
CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema so was diuresed on a Lasix
drip overnight in the MICU, with follow-up CXR showing
resolution of the edema and lung exam free of rales. On the
floor, he was diuresed with a goal of negative fluid balance
1-2L/d and was euvolemic by discharge, with no crackles or
edema.  Initially, furosemide 80IV tid was used (equivalent to
his home dose), switched to torsemide 100mg daily per cardiology
recommendations on 2011-08-25 00:00:00.  He was also discharged on
spironolactone 12.5 mg, which was started in house.
.
Past echos had shown diastolic failure with preserved EF, but
echo on this admission showed new systolic failure with EF of
30%.  Cardiology felt this might be secondary to poorly
controlled hypertension and fluid overload rather than interval
ischemic event so recommended up-titrating his carvedilol dose,
as per below.
.
#. Afib/History of PE & DVT/anticoagulation: The patient suffers
from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and also has a history of PE
and DVTs. He was admitted with supratherapeutic INR of 4.7, so
warfarin was initially held, then restarted at half dose on 2011-08-25 00:00:00
and full dose on 2011-08-25 00:00:00.
.
#. Hypertension: Cardiology recommendation is a DBP goal of <80.
 Carvedilol was titrated to 50 mg TID from 12.5 mg TID.  He was
at goal at time of discharge.
.
# Chronic pain:  patient was discharged on methadone 10 mg QID,
per discussions with patient's PCP about decreasing dose from 20
mg.  He takes methadone for chronic knee pain.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with shortness of breath, likely due to
impaired functioning of your heart with fluid in your lungs.
You were given diuretics to remove the excess fluid, with
recommendations from the cardiology team about the best
medication choices.  You also received antibiotics, which were
then discontinued because the pulmonologists did not think you
had pneumonia.  Social work saw you to discuss your questions
about UPMCE.
Discharge instructions:
1.  Weigh yourself every morning, Jrew Kochanowski MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
2.  Avoid salty foods.

The following medication changes were made:
(1) Lasix was stopped
(2) Spironolactone 12.5 mg once a day was added.  This is a
diuretic.
(3) Torsemide 100 mg once a day was added.  This is also a
diuretic.
(4) Captopril was increased to 50 mg three times a day.  This is
for your blood pressure.
(5) Methadone dose was decreased to 10 mg four times a day.

No other changes were made to your medications.

You were also give a prescription for UPMCE rehab, which is
to help your lungs.  You have been given the phone number for a
pulmonary rehab in 123 Any St. by UPMCE, which you had
requested.  This phone number is test@mail.com50.
Please call to schedule an appointment.
