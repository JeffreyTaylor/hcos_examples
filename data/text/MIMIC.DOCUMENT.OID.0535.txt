Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Jermarius Rassbach
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and Vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
55 year-old female with recently diagnosed stage IIIA fallopian
tube adenocarcinoma who presented to oncology clinic complaining
of ongoing nausea, vomiting, and weakness. She received her
first cycle of chemotherapy consisting of intravenous Taxol and
carboplatin on 2005-12-02 00:00:00, and last week received her second cycle
consisting of intravenous Taxol and intraperitoneal cisplatin,
followed by aggressive antiemetics with dolasetron, Emend, and
compazine.  Ever since her recent chemotherapy, she has had some
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and was feeling tired.  She
has not been able to keep any food down, but has been tying to
drink Boost and Ensure as tolerated. She has not had any
diarrhea.  She describes also intermittent fevers/chills at
home, without any headache, change in vision, chest pain, SOB,
excessive thirst or urination, or change in her bowel habits.
In oncology clinic she was found to be dehydrated, with a serum
sodium in the 108 range and potassium in the low 2 range, and is
admitted for further management.
.
In the ED she was afebrile, with normal vital signs, and a
normal mental status exam (per her husband). She was given IV
normal saline, potassium replacement, and was admitted to the
UPMCE for further management.  The patient's sodium improved with
normal saline. The etiology of her hyponatremia and hypokalemia
was unclear but was possibly secondary to SIADH, exacerbated by
dehydration and electrolyte loss (vomiting), or secondary to a
component of Fanconi's syndrome. Hypertonic saline and
democycline were not necessary. The patient's cortisol
stimulation test and TSH were within normal limits. Celexa was
discontinued due to its association with SIADH. The patient's
IVF were discontinued at noon the day of transfer to the OMED
floor with sodium improving to 128 and normalization of her
potassium.

Past Medical History:
1. Stage IIIA grade III left-sided fallopian tube cancer, status
post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, left pelvic lymph node dissection,
peritoneal washings and omental biopsy on 2005-12-02 00:00:00.
2. Hypertension
3. Major Depression
4. History of gastrointestinal bleed

however, it may be related to her history of ovarian cancer and
correlation with past imaging studies and patient history is

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year-old female patient with history of hypertension,
depression, and recent diagnosis of stage IIIA fallopian tube
cancer who presents with one week of nausea, vomiting, and
malaise and laboratory abnormalities of hyponatremia and
hypokalemia. This was likely secondary to either SIADH or
Fanconi's syndrome.

1. Hyponatremia. The patient's baseline sodium is 128 per
123 Any St.us records. The patient was asymptomatic on presentation.
The patient was followed by the renal team throughout admission.
Cortisol stimulation was performed with appropriate response.
TSH was within normal limits. Her serum osmolality was low, and
her urine osmolarity was high. Her urine sodium was > 60 with
FENa > 2%. Citalopram was discontinued for its association with
SIADH. Hydrochlorothiazide were discontinued because of
hyponatremia and dehydration. The patient was initially treated
with normal saline with slow correction of hyponatremia. Liberal
salt intake was encouraged. Hypertonic saline and demecycline
were not necessary. The patient's creatinine increased to 1.4
the day of discharge, possibly secondary to recent cisplatin
treatment. The patient will have repeat labwork after discharge
to monitor this.
.
2. Hypokalemia. This is most likely related to GI and renal
potassium. The patient will have outpatient labwork as above.
.
3. Nausea/vomiting. Likely secondary to chemotherapy and
hyponatremia. The patient was given anti-emetics as needed. This
was improved prior to discharge.
.
4. Fallopian tube cancer. The patient was followed by Dr.
Picone while she was in the intensive care unit. The patient
will follow-up with Drs Jermarius Rassbach. The patient's
blood counts remained stable throughout.
.
5. Hypertension. The patient was continued on Diovan. The
patient's hydrochlorothiazide was held because of the patient's
hyponatremia and dehydration.
.
6. Depression. She has a long history of major depression
including one drug overdose. She denied suicidal ideation. The
patient's citalopram was held due to its association with SIADH.
The patient was continued on Remeron. The patient will follow-up
with an outpatient psychiatrist.
.
7. Hypothyroidism. The patient's TSH was within the normal
range. The patient was continued on her outpatient dose of
levothyroxine.
.
8. Erythema of neck and back. Patient states this is related to
anxiety. The patient was given atarax as needed with good
effect.
.
9. History of gastrointestinal bleed. No active issues. The
patient was continued on Protonix.
.
