History of Present Illness:
24yo from UPMCE rehab with h/o HTN, osteoperosis, and chronic
resp failure 2010-08-30 00:00:00 to parkinson's disease, trached and peged d/t
multiple aspiration events brought to the ED from his NH with
concern for AMS. He had an unresponsive episode last night, was
reportedly hypoxic (unclear degree). Staff at NH were also
concerned about possible facial droop. The wife rescinded the
DNR order prior to arrival and stated he is to be full code. EMS
suctioned a golf ball sized mucous plug from his trach. He has
had episodes of mucus plugging in the past. Recent
hospitalization for hip fracture and ileus. Urine culture from
2010-08-30 00:00:00 grew resistant ecoli. He was started on a 7 day course of
ceftriaxone on 2010-08-30 00:00:00. Other micro history: urine w ESBL kleb,
resistant ecoli, pseudomonas resistant to zosyn in sputum and
VRE swab.
.
ED Course: Admission vitals at 0620 53 120/50 15 100. Code
stroke called with concern for new facial droop. CT head wo
contrast was negative for acute intracranial hemorrhage. Once
family arrived they confirmed that facial droop was old. Pt was
documented DNR but was reversed for transport. Family also
clarified that code status is NO COMPRESSIONS, but would want
epinephrine and similar drugs. Started ceftriaxone 1g for
presumed UTI. Briefly hypotensive to 80's at 7am, got 1L IVF.
Vitals prior to transfer: 121/53, 55, 13, 100% on vent (FiO2
40%, tidal volume 500, PEEP 5, rr 13). Access: 20g hand, 22g
hand, 18 R forearm. Foley catheter from rehab not exchanged.
.
On the floor, pt c/o L hip pain.

Radiology:

2010-08-30 00:00:00 CT HEAD NONCONTRAST:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. If
concern for acute infarct is high, please note that MR is more
sensitive if not
contra-indicated. Total opacification of the right mastoid air
cells, middle ear cavity and mucosal thickening in the right
ethmoid air cells and maxillary sinus.

2010-08-30 00:00:00 CXR:
1. Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities which are stable
and could
reflect atelectasis vs pneumonia.
2. Apparent inferior dislocation of the left humeral head,
unchanged - please correlate clinicaly.

2010-08-30 00:00:00 CXR:
Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in
position. Left-sided PICC follows a normal course terminating in
the upper
SVC.  A rounded opacity at the right base is somewhat less
apparent on the Bieler exam; however, there is increased
right-sided effusion and atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis
and small effusion are also present. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. There is atherosclerotic calcification of
the aortic arch. Prominent mediastinal and hilar densities are
compatible with calcified adenopathy.

TTE 2010-08-30 00:00:00:
Poor image quality.There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The study is inadequate to exclude significant aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-08-30 00:00:00 ,
no definite change (the RV appears similar).

2010-08-30 00:00:00 CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Small right lower lobe infiltrate.
3. 2010-08-30 00:00:00 tube in place in the pylorus of the stomach.
4. No evidence of colitis.
5. Scattered diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Normal-appearing appendix.
7. Anasarca.
8. Stable left iliac, left pubic rami, and bilateral inferior
rami fractures.

CXR 2010-08-30 00:00:00:
Following right thoracentesis, there is no visible pneumothorax.

Small residual right pleural effusion is evident. 123 Any St.usly
reported
pulmonary edema has nearly resolved. Left lower lobe opacity and
adjacent
pleural effusion appears slightly improved. Otherwise no
relevant changes.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.





Brief Hospital Course:
24y M hx of HTN, osteoperosis, and chronic resp failure 2010-08-30 00:00:00 to
aspiration from parkinson's disease, trach/2010-08-30 00:00:00 d/t multiple
aspiration events s/p unresponsive episode at nursing home,
?hypoxia, mucus plugging and hypotension, and concern for left
facial droop.

1. HYPOTENSION: Patient initially presented with leukocytosis
and bandemia. Initially was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics
with vancomyin, tobramycin, and cefepime.  He was aggressively
fluid resuscitated prior to arrival with >5LNS. Received PICC
line 2010-08-30 00:00:00.  Urine, blood, and sputum were aggressively
cultured.  CXR failed to show striking infiltrate, though
ventilator associated pnuemonia was suspected.  His BP continued
to trend to the 70s-80s, and so was started on dopamine drip on
2010-08-30 00:00:00 with appropriate BP response.   Sputum cultures from 2010-08-30 00:00:00
eventually revealed two distinct, resistant pseudomonas species,
prompting an antibiotic shift to zosyn/tobramycin on 2010-08-30 00:00:00.  He
underwent bronchoscopy and BAL on 2010-08-30 00:00:00. Vancomycin was
discontinued at that time.  Weaning his pressors proved to be
extremely difficult, and therefore alternative explanations to
his hypotension were sought.  Adrenal insufficiency was ruled
out with a normal AM cortisol of 14 and a normal cosyntropin
stimulation test.  Midodrine was started for any possible
autonomic dysfunction given his advanced parkinsons disease.  He
was started on levothyroxine 50mcg daily due to a low free T4 at
0.79.  Dopamine was changed to levophed on 2010-08-30 00:00:00.  He underwent
ABD/PELVIS CT on 2010-08-30 00:00:00 for abdominal pain, which failed to reveal
an infectious source.  Tamsulosin was discontinued due to
concern that it affected his BP control. Fluorinef was briefly
used, though eventually discontinued as he was grossly fluid
overloaded without sifnicitant hemodynamic effect.  Levophed was
stopped on 2010-08-30 00:00:00 and his systolic blood pressure has since
ranged from 110s-140s. He will continue a 14d antibiotic course
for VAP, with tobramycin ending 2010-08-30 00:00:00 and zosyn ending 2010-08-30 00:00:00.

2. FACIAL DROOP: Felt to be non-stroke and confirmed baseline by
his family. CT head negative in the ED and neuro did not feel
that pt was having a stroke.

3. VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: He was persistently hypoxic
on admission.  Most concerning is ongoing mucus plugging but
generally tolerated his home vent settings. Chest xray poorly
penetrated but possibly suggested RLL infiltrate.  Noted to have
high volume of secretions concerning for evolving pna. He was
continued on home combivent inh and acetylcysteine for
mucolytic.It was decided to treat for a 14d VAP course on
zosyn/tobramycin when 2 resistant pseudomonas species grew in
his sputum.  He received vancomycin for approximately 6 days
which was stopped after culture data failed to reveal gram
positive isolates. He was oxygenating well and tolerating short
periods of time on tracheostomy mask by the time of discharge,
and remained on his home vent settings.

4. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Resolved. Likely 2010-08-30 00:00:00 UTI vs pna vs
hypoxia or other underlying infectious etiology. Rescinded code
stroke after family confirmed appearance baseline. Some AMS may
have been due to narcotic overtreatment of his recent hip
fractures, as his mental status seemed to improve with more
conservative dosing.

5. UTI: History of resistant ecoli and ESBL org in past. Started
on broad abx per above. Foley catheter was exchanged (arrived
with condom cath from Nursing Home). Urine cultures failed to
reveal pathogenic levels of bacteria.

6. HYPONATREMIA:  initial hyponatremia to 128 eventually
resolved with volume resuscitation, likely was due to
hypovolemia.

7. PELVIC FRACTURES: Prior admission, pt had new nondisplaced
fracture involving left superior and inferior pubic rami w known
left iliac Yochanon Meek fracture.  Pain control was continued with
tramadol, oxycodone, tylenol, lidocaine patch, and ice.  Hip
x-ray without acute fracture.

8.TRACHEOSTOMY: Patient chronically trached with occasional time
off the vent. High trach pressures concerning. Per wife, pt
often spends 12-5pm off trach (sat 92% on mask) when he is well.
 He was continued on home combivent inh and acetylcysteine for
mucolytic.  He was bronched on 2010-08-30 00:00:00 and ET tube was exchanged
for larger size at that point. A noticeable cuff-2010-08-30 00:00:00 continued,
and his trach was again upgraded to a 9.0 on 2010-08-30 00:00:00, however
substantial cuff pressures were needed to prevent leakage. A
Bieler tracheostomy tube was then placed on 2010-08-30 00:00:00 with
improvement of his 2010-08-30 00:00:00.

9. Parkinson's disease: Chronic.  Patient with severe dysphagia
and tracheostomy. He continued home carbidopa/levidopa,
entacapone, pramipexole.

10.MACULAR DEGENERATION: cont home eye gtt w warm compresses
following.

11. FLUID OVERLOAD:  Patient roughly 8L positive fluid balance
due to aggresive fluid resuscitation, hypotension, and multiple
IV meds.  He will require diuresis back down to his dry weight
in his nursing home.

12. CODE STATUS: wife clarified that code status is NO
COMPRESSIONS, but would want epinephrine and similar drugs.

13. ANEMIA: His HCT trended down from admission 28 to 21-22.
Received one PRBC transfusion. Iron, b12, folate wnl. hapto 282,
retic: 2.1, LDH: wnl

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr Bieler it was a pleasure taking care of you.

You were brought to UPMCE for evaluation of altered mental status.
Head imaging was negative for stroke. While in house you
developed hypotension as well as difficulty weaning of
ventilation.
.
Imaging and labs were concerning for potential pneumonia and you
were started on broad spectrum antibiotics. With treatment of
pneumonia your breathing improved. In addition we switched your
trach with improvement in symptoms.
.
To treat your hypotension you were started on midodrine and
treated for infection.
.
Medications changes:
To treat infection:
1. Take Tobramycin 240mg IV every 36hrs. Your last dose of
tobramycin at UPMCE occurred on 2010-08-30 00:00:00; your last dose will be due on
the 29th.
3. Take Zosyn 4.5mg every 6hrs. Your last dose of antibiotics
will be on 2010-08-30 00:00:00.
.
To treat low blood pressure:
1. Take Midodrine 10mg. Take one capsult three times daily
.
To treat hypothyroid
1. Take Levothyroxine 50mcg daily.
** You will need repeat TFTs in 6weeks with plan for dose
alteration if needed.
.
To prevent clot formation you were start on SQ heparin.
.
Again it was a pleasure taking care of you. Please contact with
any questions or concerns
