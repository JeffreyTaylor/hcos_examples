CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 4070**]
Reason: interval chnage



UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
   65 year old man S/P CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   interval chnage



Final Report
INDICATION: Status post CABG, please evaluate interval change.

Comparison is made to the prior study of 2008-08-27 00:00:00.

Finidngs: The small right apical pneumothorax is unchnaged.
Small to moderate left pleural effusion is increasing. The
elevated left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. The heart size is
normal, aorta is tortuous.

Findings were discussed with Kyriah Momper (N.P) at the time of
dictation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax.
2. Increasing left pleural effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal IVC
diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch. No 2D or Doppler evidence of
distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. LV inflow
pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and underwent coronary artery bypass
graft surgery.  See operative report for further details.  He
received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.  Post
operatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit for
hemodynamic management.  In first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without complications.  On postoperative day one he
was transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked with him
on strength and mobility.  On postoperative day two he developed
atrial fibrillation that was treated with betablockers and
amiodarone, he converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  He
continued to do well, was gentle diuresed to preoperative
weight.  He was ready for discharge home with services on post
operative day four.
