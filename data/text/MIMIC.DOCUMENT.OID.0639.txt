Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45
%). The right ventricle displays borderline normal free wall
function. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (2011-08-24 00:00:00+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. Kadraya Heus was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. Suboptimal imaging is
worsened and the study is limited for that reason. The left
ventricular systolic function is about the same as pre-bypass
with an EF of about 40-45%. A focal wall motion abnormality is
not seen but can not be fully excluded. Initially after
separation from bypass, the basal right free wall of the right
ventricule, which is the only portion that is well seen,
displayed moderate to severe hypokinesis. Ten minutes after
separation, the function was improved to the pre-bypass state.
The tricuspid regurgitation was slightly worsened and bordered
on moderate but improved to pre-bypass level as well. The mitral
valve is not seen and the extent of mitral regurgitation could
not be adequately assessed. In limited views, the thoracic aorta
appears intact
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from OSH on 2011-08-24 00:00:00. Preop w/u completed and went to
surgery with Dr. Kadraya Heus on 2011-08-24 00:00:00. Transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition on titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips.
Extubated later that evening and awoke neurologically intact.
Transferred to the floor on POD #1.  In the operating room the
patient was found to have costochondral dissociation at the
sternum.  This has been followed on CXR as well as physical exam
and has remained stable post-operatively.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  Physical
therapy was consulted for assistance with post-operative
strength and mobility.  The patient progressed as planned
through the cardiac surgery pathway without complication.  He
was discharged in good condition to home on POD 4.  He was found
to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm preoperatively and has been
arranged to follow up with Dr. Kadraya Heus Anushri Ernest.
