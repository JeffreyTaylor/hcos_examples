History of Present Illness:
Ms. 123 Any St. female with PMH significant
for HTN, HLD, and chronic UTI's who is being transferred to the
MICU for management of hypotension. Per her son,
the patient's home nurse noted that she had a slight temperature
this morning. Her son noted that her a123 Any St.e was poor and was
also incoherent. He also noted that her catheter contained urine
that was dark and concentrated. He immediately called 911. She
was then brought to UPMCE ED for further work-up. There is no
report of SOB, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or
constipation. The son was also concerned that her catheter was
not working well and needed to be changed.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 102.2 BP 115/33 AR 105 RR 18 O2
sat 94% on 3L NC. She received Vancomycin 1gm IV, Zosyn 4.5gm
IV, and Tylenol 1gm. Her blood pressure dropped to 95/43 and
given lack of improvement after receiving 3L NS, she is being
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Left anterior
fascicular block. Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2005-07-09 00:00:00
heart rate has increased. Otherwise, no major change.
2005-07-09 00:00:00: KUB Single AP abdominal radiograph obtained, however,
limited as only the superior portion of the abdomen imaged. The
imaged portion is obscured by overlying pannus, however, the
underlying bowel loops show a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with
mildly air-filled distended loops of colon. No intra-abdominal
free air. Multiple left-sided rib deformities are noted.
2005-07-09 00:00:00: Single AP chest radiograph compared to 2005-07-09 00:00:00 show
slightly increased interstitial lung markings, which may
represent mild edema with areas of new patchy opacity in the
right lung base and left mid lung, which may represent
atelectasis although aspiration/pneumonia would be difficult to
exclude. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The
cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Again seen are multiple
left-sided rib deformities.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Moderate opacification from fluid versus mucosal thickening
in the
maxillary sinuses, not Denson, [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect
sinusitis, and
clinical correlation is recommended.

CTA Chest 2005-07-09 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Mild cardiac decompensation with pulmonary vascular
congestion but no
alveolar edema. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Possible small airways infection in the right middle lobe.
4. Aneurysmal descending aorta, 4 cm. Descending aortic graft in
place
without complication.
5. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries suggesting underlying
pulmonary
artery hypertension.

2005-07-09 00:00:00 MRI HIP
FINDINGS:
Please note that due to hardware failure, the complete sequences
could not be obtained.
There is a comminuted left proximal femur intertrochanteric
fracture, with
coxa varus orientation. There is a large amount of marrow edema
within the
proximal femur. Marrow edema and a small fracture line also
extends into the femoral neck. However, the marrow signal in the
femoral head appears normal. There is a small left hip joint
effusion. The adjacent left acetabulum appears normal. There is
a large amount of surrounding muscular edema. Also noted is
abnormal marrow signal in bilateral ischial tuberosities, left
greater than right. These areas of abnormal marrow signal are
just deep to the bilateral decubitus ulcers. In the appropriate
clinical setting, these are consistent with osteomyelitis.
The right hip appears normal. There is no evidence of right hip
fracture.
A suprapubic catheter is present. There is a large amount of
pelvic
musculature atrophy, consistent with patient's history of
quadri123 Any St..
There are spinal cysts which are partially visualized on the T1
images in the sacral spine. Due to lack of T2-weighted images,
these cannot be further evaluated. Differential consideration
includes Tarlov cyst.

8/3 L HIP XR: IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of the proximal left
femur.

2. Sclerosis and osseous irregularity of the left ischial
tuberosity in the region of a vacuum drain is concerning for
osteomyelitis. Correlation with the recently performed MRI is
advised.

2005-07-09 00:00:00 R HIP XR: Markedly limited study without definite evidence
for acute bony injury or marked infection. If there is high
clinical concern, cross-sectional imaging is recommended. Due to
the patient's large size MRI may not be possible and CT scan may
be the best alternative.  (Per discussion with radiologist after
fracture seen on MR, fracture was 123 Any St.usly visible on this
film as well, but was poor study)



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. 123 Any St. female with PMH as listed
above who presents with transient hypotension and leukocytosis.

1)Hypotension: Patient initially found to be hypotensive with
SBP~90's despite receiving 3L NS. Her baseline SBP is between
110-120's. Upon transfer to the MICU, her BP stabilized. The
drop in her BP may have been early sepsis physiology given
fever, history of recurrent UTI's. She may also have some
underlying autonomic dysregulation given para123 Any St.. She was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn given prior culture results
which grew E.coli and enterococcus. After transfer to the floor
on 2005-07-09 00:00:00 her BP remained stable SBP 110s-120s, no longer
requiring IVF.

2)Leukocytosis/fevers: Patient noted to have WBC~14.0 and
febrile on admission. Cxray was not very revealing. Her U/A was
positive for leukocytes and nitrites but no WBCs and urine cx
were negative. Plastic surgery was consulted to see patient
while she was in-house and recommended VAC dsg changes q MWF.
She continued to spike fevers until 2005-07-09 00:00:00 on Vanc/Zosyn but
remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course.
Since her urine cultures and blood cultures were all negative,
we explored other etiologies for her fever. She had a CTA that
did not show a PE but did show possible PNA. She also had XRs of
her hips to look for osteomyelitis given B/L decubitus ulcers.
Initial XR was poor study. ESR was checked and was 105. MRI
showed abnormal marrow signal of B/L ischial tuberosities near
areas of decubitus ulcers c/w osteomyelitis. Zosyn was
discontinued, vancomycin was continued and Levofloxacin was
added for gram negative coverage for her osteo. She will need 6
week course (5 more weeks of antibiotics). She will also need
follow-up of inflammatory markers which trended down during
hospital stay.

3)Mental status changes: Per son, the patient was less coherent
on day of admission. This resolved rapidly with resolution of
hypotension and fever. CT head was negative.

4)Neurogenic bladder: Patient has chronic SP foley catheter
placement as a result of her para123 Any St.. The patient's son
reported that her foley was not working appropriately. Urology
was contactAldene Denson on floor and performed SP catheter change and
wound care was consulted for ostomy bag change around catheter.
She was also reporting increased bladder spasms since Baclofen
was originally held in MICU. Spasms resolved with restarting
Baclofen and she had decreased leaking around SP catheter after
catheter/bag change.

5)L trochanter ulcer: Patient is followed closely by plastic
surgery as an outpatient. She has a wound vac on her left lower
extremity. Wound care and plastic surgery were consulted and
changed VAC on MWF. She was continued on Zinc sulfate. When
findings of osteomyelitis were reported on MRI, plastics was
again contactAldene Denson and they did not feel that further debridement
was neccessary at that time. She will follow up in plastics
clinic. L buttock VAC dsg changes should continue qMWF.

6.) Left femur fracture: Incidentally, patient noted to have
comminuted L intertrochanteric femur fracture on MRI. She denied
any pain or h/o trauma. Imaging also commented on osteopenia.
She was started on calcium and vitamin D supplements as well as
Alendronate q week for atraumatic fracture. Ortho was consulted
and did not recommend surgery since she was non-weight bearing
on that leg and did not have pain. Could consider endocrine
workup and/or bone density scan as outpatient. She will follow
up in ortho clinic as outpatient.

7)GERD: Continued on Pantoprazole.

8)COPD: Pt reports she has "lung disease" but denies known h/o
COPD and PFTs in 2005-07-09 00:00:00 were normal. She required 3L O2 NC while
in hospital to maintain O2 sats around 94-95%. She reports that
she was intermittently on 3L O2 at home, but it was unclear who
started her home oxygen and what the original indication was.
She was continued on outpatient regimen of Advair and Combivent.
She has not seen a pulmonologist in the past, but follow up was
arranged for PFTs and an appointment was made with Dr. Kanaloa Loonsfoot.

9)Depression: Outpatient regimen was initially held given mental
status. She was then re-started on Gabapentin, Nortriptyline,
and Bupropion.

Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, normotensive


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with fever, low blood
pressure, and confusion. This was most likely from an infection
of the bones in your hips. We also found that you have a
fracture of your left hip. You should not bear any weight on
this leg and should have a repeat X ray in approximately 6 weeks
to ensure that it is healing.

We made the following changes to your medications
1. We added Vancomycin 1g IV twice daily
2. We added Levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily
3. We added Calcium and Vitamin D supplements
4. We added Alendronate 75 mg PO q week

Please return to the ER or call your primary care physician if
you have fever >101, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or
pain in your hips.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor Dr. Kanaloa Loonsfoot
Denson. Call test@mail.com if you have any questions. He will
see you at home. You should also have a repeat X ray of your
left hip to ensure continued resolution of hip fracture.

You will also need to have lab work done to follow safety labs
and inflammatory markers. This will be drawn by nurses in your
home.

Please follow up with Dr. Kanaloa Loonsfoot in Pulmonary clinic. You
have an appointment on Wednesday 2005-07-09 00:00:00 at 8am. Please
