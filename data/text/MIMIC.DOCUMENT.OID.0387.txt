History of Present Illness:
 This is an 81-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
CAD s/p MI, MDS on cycle 2 Vidaza, anemia, severe COPD baseline
home oxygen 2.5 L , hypertension, hyperlipidemia,also with
bladder cancer status post TURBT and BCG treatment in 2007-08-29 00:00:00
presenting with retroperitoneal bleed. He presented to 123 Any St.
ED this afternoon with left sided abdominal pain radiating to
his left thigh. He had 123 Any St.usly been hospitalized there from
2007-08-29 00:00:00 for SOB and tachycardia during which he was found to
have a PE and PNA and discharged to rehab on lovenox bridge to
coumadin and levfloxacin. CT at 123 Any St. showed active
extravasation on CTA abd/pelvis. HCT 23.9, received 1U PRBC and
10mg vitamin K and transferred to UPMCE.

transfusion). In ED Became hypotensive to 59/44 with 1U PRBC
given, 1 U FFP, improving to 111/50 HR in 100s. ED EKG showed
sinus tachycardia. Increasing pain ? tamponading vs worse
managed with fentanyl boluses. Surgery consulted, noted LLQ/L
groin pain c/w location of RP bleed on CT scan, recommended
consulting interventional radiology for possible intervention
and continued transfusion, resuscitation with plan to follow. IR
consulted for angio,felt risks of angio outweighed benefits of
resuscitation, watching.

Studies:
2007-08-29 00:00:00 CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now
a
right jugular sheath in place without evidence of pneumothorax.
Endotracheal
tube tip lies approximately 8 cm above the carina.

Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.

2007-08-29 00:00:00 CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
Interval increase of left retroperitoneal hematoma, now with
decompression
into the peritoneal cavity.  Small amounts of blood tracking
around the liver,
both paracolic gutters, and into the pelvis.


2007-08-29 00:00:00 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
In comparison with the study of 2007-08-29 00:00:00, there is continued
hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
disease.  There
is associated decrease in markings at the apices with coarse
interstitial
markings in the lower lung zones.  The possibility of
supervening pneumonia
would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
81M with CAD s/p MI, severe COPD (home oxygen 2.5 L), HTN, HL,
MDS (on cycle 2 Vidaza), and bladder cancer (s/p TURBT and BCG
treatment in 2007-08-29 00:00:00 was transferred from UPMCE [**Location (un) **] 2007-08-29 00:00:00 with
retroperitoneal bleed and is now s/p coil embolizatoin of left
hypogastric artery and IVC filter placement. He remained
hemodynamically stable post-operatively and has was called out
of the CV ICU to the medicine floor.

# Retroperitoneal bleed: Atraumatic bleed in the setting of
anticoagulation for provoked DVT/PE with INR in therapeutic
range of 2.3 at presentation. Initially presented to 123 Any St.
where CT showed active extravasation on CTA abd/pelvis. HCT
23.9, INR 1.8, received 1U PRBC and 10mg vitamin K and
transferred to UPMCE. Transferred to MICU for hypotension. In
the MICU, IR was consulted and then vascular surgery. Iliac
aneurysm was found and patient transferred to vascular surgery.
He was continuing to have expansion of the RP hematoma. Had CT
scan at 5am on 2007-08-29 00:00:00 which showed expansion with decompression of
peritoneal cavity and his hypogastric artery was coil embolized,
achieving hemostasis. The bleeding was not related to his iliac
aneurysm. He was then brought to the CV ICU post-operatively.
Arbitrary transfusion goal of 30 (was in 28 range before this
acute illness due to MDS). Only got 2 units in CV ICU. In total
he was transfused 10 units since arrival to UPMCE (6 peri
operatively) Last transfusion 2007-08-29 00:00:00 at 9pm with HCT 25 -> 30.
Throughout his stay in the CVICU, he did not require pressors
and has been hypertensive today with SBP~150. Peripheral access
was obtained in the CV ICU and his cortis was pulled.
Transferred from CV ICU to medicine on 2007-08-29 00:00:00 and he remained
hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit in the 28-33
range.

# PE: Diagnosed 2007-08-29 00:00:00 by CTA revealing subsegmental right lower
lobe pulmonary embolus. Was anticoagulated with INR 2.3 on
admission, and is now s/p reversal given RP bleed coil of
hypogastric artery. On heparin drip bridging to coumadin.
Started coumadin 5 mg daily on 2007-08-29 00:00:00. No evidence of bleeding and
stable hematocrits. He had an IVC filter placed 2007-08-29 00:00:00 (Cook
Select Filter). He will require a total of 6 months of
anticoagulation and will follow up with his Hematologist for
ongoing management of his DVT/PE. At the time of discahrge he
was satting 99% on his home O2 (2L NC).

# Elevated Bicarb: Bicarb peaked at 43. Likely multifactorial
due to COPD with chronic renal compensation and retention of
bicarb. Also likely component of contraction alkalosis secondary
to aggressive diuresis. Started acetazolamide 2007-08-29 00:00:00 through 2007-08-29 00:00:00.
Bicarb was 34 at the time of discharge. His HCO3 should continue
to be monitored as long as he is being actively diuresed.

# LE edema: Patient with continued marked lower extremity edema
likely from iatrogenic volume overload due to transfusion of 10U
pRBCs. He was diuresed with Lasix 20mg IV qday for the duration
of his course with marked improvement in his volume overload. He
should continue to have his legs elevated at night and
throughout the day when recumbent in bed. He should also
continue Lasix 40mg PO qday for 3 days. He should have his
electrolytes checked twice daily while receiving Lasix.

# COPD: Patient has a history severe COPD with FEV1 of
approximately 0.7 on 2.5L NC at home. His home medications were
continued and there was no e/o COPD flare on this admission. At
the time of discharge he was satting well on his home O2.

# Ischemic Colitis: Diagnosed UPMCE CT 2007-08-29 00:00:00, involving
descending/sigmoid colon area. Initially presumed infectious s/p
10 day course cipro/flagyll but in context of atherosclerotic
disease and large volume bleed, ischemic seemed more likely. Pt
was transfused per above and was having normal non bloody BMs at
the time of discharge.

# MDS: He is s/p Vidaza with continued pancytopenia. In
consultation with outpatient oncologist, will hold off on
additional chemotherapy for MDS at this time. He will f/u with
his outpatient Oncologist for ongoing management of MDS.

# Liver and renal hypodensities: seen on CT scan last UPMCE
admission likely cysts vs hemangiomas.
- outpatient MRI/renal US to further evaluate

# CAD s/p MI: His home Atorvastatin and Diltiazem were continued
throughout his course. He is allergic to ASA.

# GERD: His home omeprazole 20 mg PO daily was continued.

# Hyperlipidemia: His home Atorvastatin 40mg PO daily was
continued.

# Transitional issues:
- Patient will need IV heparin bridge to Coumadin (INR goal 2007-08-29 00:00:00
for 6 months)
- Will need daily INR checks until therapeutic
- Patient scheduled for follow up with Vascular Surgery (Dr.
Galilea Cearns
- Please ensure the patient follows up for interval IVC filter
removal.  The filter is a Cook Celect filter.
- Patient scheduled for follow up with Ashely Sudduth Ashely Sudduth
- Pt will need his Na, Cl, K, Cr and Mg checked twice daily for
3 days while being diuresed with Lasix.
- Pt will need outpatient MRI/renal US to evaluate liver and
renal hypodensities seen on CT

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Sudduth,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were bleeding
internally (retroperitoneal hemeorrhage).  You were given
multiple blood transfusions.  You required an endovascular
procedure to stop the bleeding as well as to prevent a future
blood clot in your lungs. Due to the recent blood clots in your
leg and lungs, you were restarted on blood thinners (Heparin and
Coumadin) and you should continue taking Coumadin as prescribed
following discharge.  You will need to have your blood drawn
often to determine how much Coumadin you will need to take.
