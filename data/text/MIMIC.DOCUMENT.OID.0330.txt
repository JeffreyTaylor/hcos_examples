History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 yo WF with a PMHx of advanced 2010-07-28 00:00:00 progressive MS,
chronic indwelling foley, h/o pe on coumadin who p/f personal
care home with AMS
.
The patient's last admission was 2010-07-28 00:00:00 who was admitted for
AMS and acute on chronic lethargy.  They dx her with toxic
metabolic encephalopathy 2010-07-28 00:00:00 to UTI and mrsa follicullitis (she
had a dermatomal rash).  She was treated with vancomycin, she
improved was transitioned to orals bactrim and doxycycline and
was d/c.
.
The following history was obtained from an LPN named Donne Mcclaren
Donne Mcclaren at test@mail.com.  She states that since the patient
prior admission she never returned to her baseline.  The patient
seems to have a waxing and wanning mental status.  She denies
seeing the patient have twitching movements or signs of
infection such as recent diarrhea, fever or cough.  Temps at UPMCE
ranged from 99.2-99.4.  The patient recently history is notable
for non-compliance both when she is oriented and when she is
not.  She refuses UA evalaution and also refuses suprapubic
care.  It is not clear when the last time her supr-pubic cath
was changed.  Starting the day of admission, the patient was
incoherent, was unable to swallow her pills and was salivating.
she was deemed usafe to be at her home and was sent to the ED
and UPMCE.
.
The patient arrived to the ED and was intially minimally
responsive.  Per the ED reports she improved while there from a
MS perspective.  They did an I and D of the area around her SP
cath and it was sent for culture which showed GPC in  pairs and
GPR.  BC and Urine cultures were sent.  The patient HCT showed
nothing acute and her CXR was wnl.  The patient was given
levofloxacin and sent to the floor.

Focal spongiosis, focal follicular neutrophilic parakeratosis,
sparse superficial perivascular dermatitis with rare
eosinophils, and mild papillary dermal edema.  The changes are
mild and non-specific.  The finding of neutrophilic
parakeratosis at a follicular ostium (slide L1-2) is suggestive
of seborrheic dermatitis.  While the anatomic site is somewhat
unusual, a seborrheic dermatitis-like drug eruption is possible.
 Seborrheic dermatitis may occur more frequently with some
medical disorders including epilepsy.  PAS stain is negative for
fungi.  Clinical-pathologic correlation is recommended.

Imaging:
CXR 2010-07-28 00:00:00: A single portable chest radiograph is obtained. There
has been no significant interval change in comparison to prior
study from 2010-07-28 00:00:00.  No focal consolidation, effusion, or
pneumothorax is seen. The heart and mediastinal contours are
unremarkable. No soft tissue or bony abnormalities noted.
Biapical pleural thickening is stable.

Non-contrast Head CT 2010-07-28 00:00:00: There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or major vascular territorial
infarct. Hypoattenuation in the subcortical and periventricular
white matter is mild and unchanged, likely sequelae of chronic
microvascular ischemic disease. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and symmetric in configuration. There is no shift
from normally midline structures. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear with interval resolution
of the right sphenoid sinus air-fluid level. No osseous
abnormality is identified.

MRI Head w/&w/o contrast 2010-07-28 00:00:00:
1. No evidence of acute findings.
2. Stable white matter lesions consistent with patient history
of Multiple
Sclerosis.
3. Incompletely visualized atrophy of the spinal cord.
4. Opacification of the mastoid air cells.
.
EEG 2010-07-28 00:00:00: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of initially continuous generalized electrographic seizures
consistent
with non-convulsive status epilepticus. Over the course of the
recording, these frequent seizures subsided with antiseizure
medication
administration. There was a transition from frequent
electrographic
seizures to infrequent bifrontal epileptiform discharges at
around 22:00
hours. There was no recurrence of electrographic seizures for
the
remainder of the study duration. Background activity remained
slowing,
indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.

EEG 2010-07-28 00:00:00: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of frequent rhythmic bifrontal epileptiform discharges occurring

intermittently throughout the recording. The background rhythm
was
diffusely slow indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. Compared to the prior days recording there were
periodic
epileptiform discharges which did not evolve into electrographic

seizures.

EEG 2010-07-28 00:00:00: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring study
due
to several electrographic seizures in the frontal central region
more
predominant on the right associated with clinical jerking of the

shoulders and occasionally gagging. Also, the background showed
a
generalized delta slowing consistent with a diffuse
encephalopathic
process with a non-specific etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 53 yo WF with a PMHx of severe MS, MRSA folliculitis, c.
diff who p/f UPMCE with AMS c/w delerium picture who is also found
to be hyponatremic (Na-122) with a dirty UA from a PB catheder
with labs significant for leukopenia and hypothermia.
.
In the ED the patient received a dose of levofloxacin, had a
negative HCT, got a 123 Any St.inary laboratory w/u and was sent to
the floor.
.
Upon arrival the patient was able to follow simple commands and
would participate in strength testing.  She was mostly non
verbal only speaking 2010-07-28 00:00:00 word phrases that were mostly non
sensical.  She was unable to relate any history.  As a result
the patient UPMCE and medical power of attorney were called.  The
patient has a fairly highly functioning individual who was
verbal and able to ambulate with assistance several monthly ago,
according to the medical power of attorney, Mrs. Donne Mcclaren.
The patient was then admitted for a similar episode of AMS which
was attributed to toxic metabolic encephalopathy at that time.
She was then discharged and since that time has never been back
to her baseline.  According to the nursing home she would have
waxing and Debb Palodichuk MS and was non compliant with care.
.
The patient was free water restricted as it was reported that
the patient consumed up to 3L of free water a day.  She was
started on vanco/levoquin for her SIRS.  The patient sodiums
were monitored overnight and fluids were restarted on her to
help correct her hyponatremia.  Neurology was consulted and they
did not have any additional recomendations at that time.
.
The second day of admission it was reported that the patient was
uncooperative with care and unable to swallow pills.  The
urology service did come by and changed the patients SPC without
significant difficulty.  During evalaution she was witnessed
having horizontal nystagmus and jaw twitching.  A BG was
obtained which was wnl and a stat EEG was ordered.  The patients
repeat Na was 118 and hypotonic infusions that were able to be
discontinued were.  The patients EEG showed characteristics of
status epilepticus and her seizures broke with ativan 1 mg.  She
was also loaded with 1 g of dilantin.  Neurology consults were
made aware of the situation and they aggreed with the above
management.  Their additional recomendations were to conduct an
LP, cover empirically with vanco/ceftriaxone and acyclovir and
to do a brain MRI when the patient is clinically stable.  It was
decided that a transfer to the UPMCE was most appropriate at this
time.
UPMCE Course
53 yo female with advanced secondary progressive MS, admitted in
status epilepticus, which was likely secondary to a urinary
tract infection, c/b hyponatremia and septic shock, who
continued to have seizures, with waxing and Debb Palodichuk mental status
and was, consequently, trach'd and PEG'd at the bedside.  Her
anti-epileptic treatment was also complicated by a drug rash.

# Seizures: Upon presentation to the ICU, the patient was in
status epilepticus, which was thought to be secondary to Debb Palodichuk
and hyponatremia.  LP was performed and returned negative for
infectious processes in the CSF.  She was intubated for airway
protection while in status.  She was placed on continuous EEG
monitoring, which showed bifrontal epileptiform seizures.  Her
seizures were treated with levetiracetam, phenytoin, valproic
acid and lacosamide, and therapeutic levels of these medications
were monitored.  Additionally, her Debb Palodichuk and hyponatremia were
treated.  She was evaluated for cerebral structural lesions with
a brain MRI, which showed stable periventricular plaques,
consistent with MS. Donne Mcclaren and hyponatremia resolved
with treatment and patient was on 4 epileptics, patient
continued to have intermittent seizures.  She also had GPEDs on
her EEG which is c/w high mortality and very poor prognosis from
mental status standpoint.

# Urinary tract infection: Urine culture on presentation grew
Pseudomonas and Serratia, with an I&D of an abscess at the
patient's indwelling suprapubic catheter growing Pseudomonas.
It is likely that the infection lowered the patient's seizure
threshold.  Her UTI was treated with a 14-day course of
cefepime, to which both her Pseudomonas and Serratia were
sensitive.

# Septic shock: Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was in
septic shock, with hypotension, hypothermia, altered mental
status, WBC 14 and left-shift, as well as evidence of end-organ
dysfunction in a transient transaminitis.  Likely source of
infection was the urinary tract, as discussed above.  However,
there was also evidence of possible aspiration on CXR, in the
context of ongoing seizures.  The patient was empirically
treated for HCAP, initially with cefepime, vancomycin and
levofloxacin, which was then tailored to cefepime/vanc as levo
lowers the seizure threshold, for a total of 8 days.  Her
initial hypotension and transaminitis resolved with IV fluids.
Initial thrombocytopenia, which subsequently resolved, was
likely attributable to systemic inflammation as well.  The
patient's vital signs were and WBC were carefully monitored.

# Hyponatremia: On arrival to the ICU, the patient was
hyponatremic.  This was likely due to SIADH, possibly cerebral
salt wasting, and effective intravascular volume de123 Any St.n due
to third-spacing, which were exacerbated by her acute infection.
 She was treated with free water restriction, normal saline and
diuresis for third-spacing and volume overload.  Her diuresis
was complicated by a metabolic alkalosis, which was corrected
with acetozolamide, potassium supplementation and prudent use of
furosemide.  Acetozolamide was discontnued and patient did not
have re-surfacing of hyponatremia.

# Mechanical ventilation: Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient
was intubated for airway protection, while actively seizing.
After a few days, she began to breathe spotaneously on pressure
support ventilation; however, due to continued seizures, copious
secretions, and waxing and Debb Palodichuk mental status, it was
123 Any St.ted that she would require prolonged airway protection.
For this reason, Interventional Pulmonology performed a bedside
tracheostomy under sedation at the bedside on 2010-07-28 00:00:00 and
Gastroenterology performed a bedside PEG placement on 2010-07-28 00:00:00.  The
patient's tracheostomy was complicated by bleeding, as she was
anticoagulated on enoxaparin.  She eventually transitioned to
trach mask, with good oxygen saturation.

#Rash: The patient developed a macular rash on her both of her
lower extremities, which was initially suspected to be due to a
fungal infection; however, KOH stain and fungal cultures
returned negative, and the rash was unresponsive to topical
antifungal medications.  Medication reaction was suspected,
since the rash appeared several days after beginning new
antiepileptic medications.  Biopsy of the rash showed
non-specific signs of inflammation.  The rash responded well to
steroid (fluocinonide 0.01%) ointment.  Her LFTs and CBC were
trended out of concern for DRESS.

# History of PE: The patient was anticoagulated with enoxaparin,
which was held as needed for procedures.  She developed no signs
or symptoms of new thrombosis.

# Normocytic Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia, likely
anemia of chronic disease vs. iron deficiency.  Her anemia was
exacerbated by bleeding after tracheostomy on 2010-07-28 00:00:00, but remained
stable thereafter. She had several more episodes of oozing from
the tracheostomy site as well as from the PEG site.
.
#Goals of care: Patient had [** Location **]usly made her goal of care
wishes very clear to her healthcare proxy and her family and
also had it in writing.  Her wish was that if she were not
functional and alert, she did not want extraordinary measures
taken to prolong her life. Primary ICU team and neurology team
had involved family meeting with HCP and 2 daughters.  It was
explained to the family that in the setting of continous
seizures and no improvement in mental status despite resolution
of what was thought to be instigating them (infection,
hyponatremia), long term prognosis for mental status recovery
was very poor.  Family felt that Ms.Mcclaren would not want to be
kept alive like this and decision was to make her CMO and
transfer to Mcclaren.

Hyponatremia


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic and not arousable.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for confusion and lethargy,
and were sent to the ICU for septic shock most likely due to a
severe urinary tract infection.  During your stay, you required
intubation due to respiratory distress and eventually had a
tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube placed.  You continued to have
frequent seizures despite multiple antiepileptic medications,
and your confusion did not improve significantly.  After
discussion with your health care proxy and family, it was
determined that your wishes would be to transition to comfort
care, and transfer to a UPMCE facility was arranged.  Your
medications were adjusted with the goal of maximizing comfort
and minimizing pain or anxiety.


Followup Instructions:
You are being discharged to inpatient UPMCE.  Doctors at the
Donne Mcclaren facility will manage your ongoing medical care.
