Attending:Lekayla Ogram
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD s/p sclerotherapy


History of Present Illness:
81y/o M with h/o diverticular bleed presented to ED with melena
and BRBPR x1 day.  Pt felt lightheaded, but denied CP,
palpitations, or dyspnea at rest. + DOE.  Denied N/V.  Pt was
noted to be guaiac positive on ED exam.  Hct had dropped from
41.9 in 2008-10-12 00:00:00 to 33.7.  NG lavage was performed, which revealed
active bleeding that did not clear - 1000cc lavage was
performed.  Pt was noted to have ST depressions in V2-V3 and
elevated troponin to 0.15.  Pt was transfused 5 units PRBCs.
EGD revealed esophageal varices and active bleeding.  Banding
was attempted but unsuccessful.  Profuse bleeding was noted
during EGD, and pt had episodes of frank hematemesis.  He was
therefore intubated and sedated.

In the Bashirah Venezia, pt rec'd 6 units PRBC and 5 units FFP (INR 2.9 on
presentation).  He also rec'd protonix 40mg IV x1, sandestatin
200mcg IV x1, levofloxacin 500mg IV x1, propofol gtt,
succinylcholine/etomidate, vitamin K sc, and octreotide gtt.  He
was given a total of 6 units FFP, as well, as well as a bag of
platelets, and taken to IR for emergent TIPS.

At IR, pt was noted to have small systemic-portal pressure
gradient (10mm Hg), with elevated Pra (25mm Hg) and portal
pressures of 35mm Hg.  Varices did not fill with injection of
dye into the portal vein.  TIPS was not performed.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
2. Type 2 diabetes, with peripheral neuropathy.

treated successfully with PTCA.
2008-10-12 00:00:00: NQMI and repeat catheterzation which revealed a moderate
mid-LAD stenosis, a 30% proximal LCX stenosis, a normal RCA and
an 80% D1 stenosis. He was treated medically.
2008-10-12 00:00:00: Recurrent unstable angina and repeat catheterization
revealed 30% stenosis in the mid LCX and OM 1, 50% stenosis in
the mid LAD, and 60-70% stneoses in the distal LCX and D1. Once
again he was treated medically.
2008-10-12 00:00:00: NSTEMI, admitted, CK peak 462, trop peak 0.09. In the
setting of acute bronchitis; no intervention performed.

not determine the direction of flow within the portal vein.

Heterogeneous opacification in both lower lobes has developed
over the past 48 hours accompanied by small right pleural
effusion. Presumptive diagnosis is aspiration. Borderline
cardiomegaly is stable. Upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is not
enlarged and this argues against congestive heart failure. ET

2008-10-12 00:00:00 Video Swallow
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with recent extubation, question of aspiration
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pls evaluate for aspiration
INDICATION: Dysphagia, evaluate for aspiration.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Fluoroscopic guidance was provided
for the performance of video swallow examination by speech
pathologist. The patient was given thin and nectar thickened
barium liquid, barium pudding, cookies soaked in barium, and a
barium tablet. There was mild to moderate residue in the
vallecula and piriform sinuses. No penetration or aspiration
occurred during swallowing. There is normal laryngeal elevation
and epiglottic deflection. A 12.5 mm barium tablet passes freely
through the esophagus with transient hold up at the
gastroesophageal junction.

IMPRESSION: Mild residue in the vallecula and piriform sinuses
without aspiration or penetration. Please refer to dedicated
speech pathologist report for further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  81y/o M with variceal bleeding without underlying known
liver disease.

1.  Variceal bleeding - After attempted variceal banding and
schlerotherapy in the ED, the patient went to IR for an emergent
TIPS.  However, he did not have a large portal-systemic pressure
gradient, and the varices did not fill with dye injected into
the portal vein.  The reasons for this are unclear.  Bashirah Venezia was
transfered to the MICU for hemodynamic monitoring.  He was
started on a high dose PPI and octreotide drip.  He was also on
levofloxacin for sepsis prophylaxis in the setting of upper GI
bleed and cirrhosis.  He remained stable without any evidence of
further bleed.  At this point, ensuring hemodynamic stability
was paramount.  HCT's were frequently checked and maintained >
30.  He was hypotensive, but this rapidly improved once
extubated and off of sedation (propofol, which can cause
hypotension).  He did not have evidence of further bleed and
should be SCHEDULED FOR A F/U ENDOSCOPY in 2008-10-12 00:00:00 weeks. ASA may be
restarted after EGD, but coumadin should likely be held
indefinately d/t high risk for bleed.
.
2.  Liver disease - His liver disease was of unknown etiology;
however, he had clear signs of portal hypertension with variceal
hemorrhage.  Per his PCP, Bashirah Venezia patient has infrequent alcohol
use.  His hepatitis serologies and autoimmune studies were
checked and were all negative.  He was started and maintained on
lactulose.  U/S and dopplers of portal and hepatic vessels were
performed, which showed a heterogenous liver with no masses as
well as a distended portal vein with normal flow.  Liver was
consulted and followed patient closely, and while initially the
thought was that he did not need a liver biopsy, the attending
following the patient at discharge felt a liver biopsy would be
helpful once the patient has recovered from this
hospitalization.  This issue should be addressed when the
patient goes for his outpt EGD.  Nadolol was started on 2008-10-12 00:00:00.
.
3. Respiratory Distress- He was initially intubated for airway
protection in setting of hematemesis.  However, he was difficult
to wean from the vent, and this was thought to be due to
sedation vs. developing PNA on CXR.  He was on levofloxacin
already for a UTI and GI prophylaxis.  Bronchoscopy was
performed with 2008-10-12 00:00:00.  He failed several SBT but eventually was
successfully extubated.  2008-10-12 00:00:00 revealed PMN's, GPC, and GNR's -
however, the report stated this was c/w oropharngeal flora
(although from Venezia, [**First Name3 (LF) **] unlikely).  However, because he was doing
so well s/p extubation, additionaly antibiotic coverage was not
started.  He did have some episodes of hypoxia to mid 80's,
thought to be d/t atelectasis vs. fluid overload/effusion
(patient recieved 2 L free water for hypernatremia).  Lasix 20
mg IV x 2 was given with good effect.  He was maintained on Q6
albuterol nebs and QID atrovent nebs.  By the time of discharge
he was sating > 95% on NC and was not SOB.
.
4. NSTEMI: He had ST depressions in V2/V3 with positive cardiac
enzymes.  This was likley secondary to demand ischemia in the
setting of an acute bleed.  He was maintained on simvastatin and
metoprolol IV was started once his blood pressure was stable.
Once he was able to take PO, he was started on nadolol (for
prevention of further bleed).  PLAN IS FOR STRESS TEST ONCE
PATIENT STABALIZED AS OUTPATIENT.  Aspirin has not been
restarted and should be held until after EGD.
.
4.  Diabetes mellitus - His sugars were elevated during his
hospital course, and lantus 9 units QAM was started with good
effect.  He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale as well.
.
5.  UTI - He had a positive UA in the ED, but cultures grew out
mixed flora.  He had been started empirically on levofloxacin in
the ED, and this was continued because it was also used as
sepsis prophylaxis as above.  Repeat UA was normal.
.
6.  Atrial fibrillation - His digoxin was restarted in the MICU
for rate control of his atrial fibrillation.  Digoxin levels
were monitored.  His coumadin was held in the setting of GI
bleed.  He was also started on low dose IV metoprolol once his
blood pressure was stable, and this was transitioned to nadolol.
 DECISION REGARDING RESTARTING COUMADIN SHOULD BE MADE BY
CARDIOLOGY, perhaps when following up for stress test.
.
8.  FEN - He was initially NPO in the setting of an acute bleed.
 Tube feeds were started once he had been without bleeding for
48 hours.  His electrolytes were repleted (especially calcium
given his numerous RBC transfusions).  Speech and Swallow
evaluated the patient and a video swallow was done which showed
that he does not aspirate and is OK to take PO.  He was started
on a cardiac/heart healthy diet, pureed, and was told to chew
and swallow twice before taking another mouthful of food.
Additionally, the patient was hypernatremic and was given free
water with only mild improvement in Na.  Further IV D5W was held
d/t worsening respiratory status, and it was felt that once the
patient started taking PO's again, including water, this problem
would resolve.
.
9.  Prophylaxis - He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and
high dose PPI.
