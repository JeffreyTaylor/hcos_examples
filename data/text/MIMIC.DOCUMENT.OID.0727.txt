IMAGING:
-----------------
NCHCT 2009-04-18 00:00:00(post-op): stable, with expected post-operative
changes.

MRI Head 2009-04-18 00:00:00(post-op): Expected postsurgical changes identified
at the left posterior fossa, status post meningioma resection as
described. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
ischemic changes. The 123 Any St.usly noted meningioma at the left
posterior fossa has been resected with no evidence of residual
mass, followup after complete reabsorption of the post-surgical
blood products is recommended


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for resection of left posterior
fossa mass on 2009-04-18 00:00:00 and underwent left suboccipital craniotomy
for resection of mass with cranioplasty without complications.
123 Any St.inary pathology in the OR showed that the mass was a
menigioma.  She was extubated in the OR and transferred to the
ICU post-op.  Upon her post-op check she was found to be full
strength, with PERRL, EOM's intact, no drift, and no dysmetria.

On POD#1, her examination was stable, so she was transferred to
the neurosurgery floor following her routine post-operative MRI.
Her steroids were ordered to taper to off over four days.

She was seen and evaluated by PT and OT who determined that she
was safe to go home without services. The patient developed a
rash on the left forearm which was initially thought to be
cellulitis or an allergic reaction. She was placed on
clindamycin for a couple of days. The rash was pruritic in
nature and improved greatly with benadryl. Therefore the
Clindamycin was discontinued. The rash subsequently improved

The patient continued to have pain that was 2009-04-18 00:00:00 on 2009-04-18 00:00:00 so her
pain regimen was adjusted accordingly. She responded well, and
was discharged to home in good condition on 2009-04-18 00:00:00.  of note,
the rash to her L FA was very faint and no longer pruritic at
the time of discharge.
