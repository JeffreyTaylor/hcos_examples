In ED, 99, 138/76, 81, 18, 100%RA. ETOH in ED was 455. He was
placed in C-collar and underwent CT scan of head and torso.

was admitted to neurosurgery. However, later the read of CT head

does have left parietal cephalohematoma. He was then transferred
to general surgery. On the floor, he has been withdrawing from
alcohol and was placed on an ativan CIWA scale. Receiving
2mg-4mg ativan every 4 hours but remains 'shaky'.
.
Today, while on the neuro stepdown unit, he triggered for HR in
150's and severe tremors. He received 4 IV ativan with minimal
response. While not fully documented, he may have received a
total of 9 mg IV ativan in last 24 hours. Medicine consult was
initiated and he was transferred to medicine. At time of
transfer, it was felt that due to increased nursing needs and
concern for DT, he was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring
overnight.
