Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
laser vaporization of the vulva

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 41-year-old female
with past medical history of HIV/AIDS (CD4 392 and viral load
undetectable in 2008-06-16 00:00:00), on Atripla, history of
depression/anxiety, hypertension, chronic kidney disease,
cervical and vaginal dysplasia and laryngeal papillomatosis as
well as abnormal urinary cytology admitted to the ICU following
laser vaporization of the vulva complicated by immediate post-op
desaturation on waking up, intubated in OR.

Per report the procedure went well without complication. She was
in her normal state of health prior to the procedure. Intra-op
she received a total of 2L of fluid intraoperatively. An LMA was
used. Towards the end of the case she was noted to move
suddenly. She was given a bolus dose of propofol. Following the
case she was able to breath on her own for 5-1o mintues she then
became aggressive and bit down on the LMA disloging the tube.
This was followed by an acute desaturation to the 70-80s. She
was given more propofol for sedation and mask ventilated with
some difficulty. She was intubated with blood noted in the tube.
 Over the course of an hour she was noted to be much easier to
ventilate, on exam lungs were noted to clear.  She was then
transferred to the UPMCE for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 92.4 59 97/71 12 100% SpO2
CMV Vt 500 mL PEEP of 10. Patient was intubated and sedated with
blood noted in the ET tube.

IMAGING
CXR 2008-06-16 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 2008-06-16 00:00:00:

ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the
distal stomach.  Ground-glass opacification in both lungs, right
greater than left is certainly consistent with pulmonary edema.
Although heart size is normal, the configuration suggests left
atrial enlargement and central pulmonary vasculature is engorged
suggesting elevated left atrial pressure.  Pleural effusion is
small, on the right.  No pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
41 yo female with HIV/AIDS, history of depression/anxiety,
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, admitted to the ICU
intubated following post-operative hypoxia.

#Hypoxia - Hypoxia was felt to most likely be reflective of
flash edema in the setting of breathing against a closed glottis
(hydrostatic pulmonary edema). This is supported by a chest xray
demonstrating pulmonary edema. There was signs or symptoms of
infection on imaging. The patient required intubation in the OR
and subsequently transferred to the MICU. She was diuresed with
bolus doses of 10 mg IV lasix. Respiratory status improved and
she successfully extubated on HD1.  Oxygen saturations were
stable on room air and she was discharged home.

# Jaylaun Mcever Pt with intial temp of 92 on admission to the
MICU. This was felt to most likely represent an anesthesia
effect. As above no clear evidence of infection on exam. BP
stable in the high 90s systolic. Hypothermia resolved and she
remained normothermic throughout the remainder of the
hospitalization.

# VIN III- patient now s/p laser vaporization. Procedure went
well without complication. She was prescribed premarin cream for
7 days and will follow-up with OBGYN.

STABLE ISSUES
#HIV disease-  Patients home atripla was exchanged for truvada
and efavirenz while in house.

# CKD- Creatinine was at baseline throughout this admission.
.
# HTN- hold home meds were held in the setting of hypotension.
These were restarted at the time of discharge.
