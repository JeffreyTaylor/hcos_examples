Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:

compatible with esophagitis (biopsy)
Antral gastritis
Erythema in the first and second parts of the duodenum

Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

CXR 2009-09-14 00:00:00
comparison with the study of 2009-09-14 00:00:00, the nasogastric tube has been

removed.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
some
indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggestive of elevated
pulmonary venous pressure.  Increased opacification at the left
base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms may be related
to pleural effusion and atelectasis.  However, in the
appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
to be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old woman with history of uterine carcinosarcoma
(diagnosed in 2009-09-14 00:00:00; s/p XRT and hysterectomy in 2009-09-14 00:00:00, relapsed
2009-09-14 00:00:00 now s/p 6 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol, last 2009-09-14 00:00:00) who
presented with hypotension.

#) Hypotension: Most likely was from hypovolemia. Pt had been
vomiting and had one episode of hematemesis in the ED after
being sent over from clinic visit. Also on the differential was
infection potentially from a GI or pulmonary source. Patient was
treated with empiric vanc/zosyn which was continued for 5 days
for treatment of pneumonia seen on CXR. She was transitioned to
po levofloxacin and received 6 days total of antibiotics.

#) Coffee Ground Emesis: Endoscopy showed severe esophagitis.
She required 1 unit of blood in the ICU but her hematocrit
responded appropriately and remained stable. She was given iv
pantoprazole which was transitioned to omeprazole 40 mg po BID.
The patient had no further episodes of coffee ground emesis
while on the floor. EGD showing severe esophagitis, no active
bleeding, with mild gastritis/duodenitis. There was a question
on whether or not to treat for Augustina Holmquist esophagitis but EGD did
not reveal classic white plaques. Also pt denied odynophagia.
Therefore pt not started on fluconazole. GI recs included to
continue PPI PO BID x8 weeks. Pt will need a repeat EGD in 6
weeks which GI will schedule. HCT remained stable s/p 1 unit of
PRBCs (23->26). BP stable. Active T&S. HOLDing Plavix

#) Anemia: 2009-09-14 00:00:00 be active bleeding given report of coffee ground
emesis in ED. Likely also component of hemodilution after
aggressive volume resuscitation. Patient also chronically anemic
which has been slowly worsening over past few months.

#) T2DM: Held home metformin given Holmquist and covered with a
humalog sliding scale.

#) CODE: While in the hospital pt remained DNR, OK to intubate
EXCEPT for when she went for EGD for which the code status was
changed to Full Code.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Holmquist,

It has been a pleasure taking care of you here at UPMCE. You
were admitted because of very low blood pressure. You were found
to have a pneumonia and started on antibiotics.  You were also
given IV fluids and your blood pressure improved. Because you
had an episode of vomitting with blood in the emergency
department the gastroenterology doctors saw Augustina Holmquist and did an
endoscopy (EGD) to look at your esophagus, stomach and small
intestine. There was severe inflammation in your esophagus and
some inflammation in your stomach and small intestine as well.
It is recommended that you take a new medicine, Omeprazole, for
this inflammation. Also you should follow up and have a repeat
endoscopy (EGD) in 6 weeks time. The gastroenterolgy team will
schedule this appointment. Please see below for follow up
appointments that you have.
