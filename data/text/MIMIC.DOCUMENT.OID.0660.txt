HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 47 year-old male
with polycystic kidney disease and impending renal failure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed male in no
acute distress. He is 268 pounds with a blood pressure of
133/86.  Heart rate is 106.  Neck is supple without masses.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2 clearly
heard. No murmur, rub or gallop were ap123 Any St.ted.  His lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen was
soft, distended and the kidneys and liver are easily palpable
bilaterally.  Bowel sounds are normal and present.
Extremities are with 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hemoglobin is 10.8 with a hematocrit of
34.2.  His potassium is 5.2; BUN is 54 and creatinine is 4.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating
room for an elective bilateral nephrectomy and right Perma-
cath placement. He tolerated the procedure well and was taken
to the postoperative care unit where he was noted to have
postoperative potassium of 7.4.  It should also be noted that
his bilateral kidneys, each kidney weighed about 35 pounds
and the total amount of fluid loss during the procedure,
secondary to removal of the kidneys, was estimated to be
roughly 5 liters.  Renal was consulted in the PACU.  The
patient was maintained intubated, at which time he was
dialyzed to remove the potassium which was performed on
postoperative day number zero. After the dialysis was
completed, his potassium had dropped down to 6.0 and patient
was being maintained at this time in the surgical intensive
care unit.  On the morning of postoperative day number 1, the
patient was extubated.  He did well.  He was also dialyzed
again and this brought his potassium down on postoperative
day number 2 to 4.7.  On postoperative day number 2, it was
also noted that his hematocrit had dropped to 24 from a
123 Any St.us level of 30.5.  He was followed for this.  His value
remained stable.  It was 25.2 on the following day.  By
postoperative day number 3, pressors had been weaned off.
The patient was tolerating clears.  On postoperative day
number 4, the patient was transferred to the floor.  On
postoperative day number 5, the patient was noted to be
passing flatus and had 2 bouts of emesis on the 123 Any St.us
evening while taking in clears.  The patient was made n.p.o.
again.  Urinalysis was continued and his hematocrit was
followed.  On postoperative day number 6, one of the
123 Any St. drains was discontinued.  He was
advanced to a regular diet which he tolerated well. His
hematocrit was still stable.  Now it was slowly increasing
and it was up to 26.2 on postoperative day number 7.  Patient
was still receiving dialysis. Hematocrit remained stable.
The patient was discharged home on postoperative day number
8, tolerating a regular diet, after both of his 123 Any St.-123 Any St.
drains had been removed.
