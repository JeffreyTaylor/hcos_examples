of  calcium,  2  grams  of magnesium, 6 liters of fluid.  The
patient   was   treated   with   Levofloxacin,   Flagyl,  and
Hydrocortisone.

The  patient  was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for  management  of  electrolytes.    The  patient  was given
several  ampules of calcium gluconate with improvement of the
free  calcium,  as  well  as the total calcium.  On 2006-10-12 00:00:00,  in the morning, the patient admitted to using Dulcolax
on  a daily basis and also frequent use of Fleet Phospho-Soda
enemas  and wanted to make sure that the staff knew that this
could be the possible etiology of her current symptoms.

The  patient  was  continued  to  be hydrated with IV fluids.
Electrolytes  were  repleted.   Calcium continued to improve.
The  patient  was  transferred  to  the floor for management.
Calcium  was then repleted with one gram PO calcium carbonate
with  improvement  of  free  calcium  to a normal range.  All
other  electrolytes were repleted as well.

The  Department of Psychiatry was consulted for evaluation of
the  patient  laxative  abuse.   It was felt that the use was
secondary   to  constipation  and  not  likely  due  to  body
dysmorphic  disorder  or  attempts  to lose weight.  However,
recommend  follow up as an outpatient, which the patient will
do  through  her outpatient therapist, as well as her primary
care  physician,  Laurich.  Erwin Ghanim.    The  patient  agrees to use
