HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old woman with
non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass
graft in 2010-10-26 00:00:00, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
rushed to the UPMCE Emergency
Room with fever for three days, shortness of breath and right
sided chest pain.  She has been meanwhile at home receiving
visiting nurse care.  She states the fever at home was as
high as 101.4 degrees.  She was 123 Any St.usly admitted to CT
surgery service for median sternotomy wound drainage which
required IV antibiotics and wound debridement.  At home she
denies any productive cough, wheezing or wound drainage.  The
symptoms were first noticed by the patient two days ago and
have worsened over the past several days.

Hydroxyprogesterone, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Ultram 50 mg po
q day, Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Pravachol 0.25 mg po q day,
Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid.

ALLERGIES:  No allergies.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post CABG times three on
2010-10-26 00:00:00.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, T max 101.5, blood
pressure 106/70, pulse 88, respirations 16, FAO2 90% on five
liters.  In general, alert and oriented times three,

the left.   Chest, no pulmonary embolism, no infiltrate or
consolidation, some modest right effusion with right lower
lobe atelectasis, small left effusion, small amount of fluid
in the anterior mediastinum, no pneumomediastinum.

Labs, CBC with white count 14.0, hematocrit 27.2, platelet
count 330,000, differential of 95% neutrophils, 0% bands.
Chemistries, sodium 135, potassium 5.2, chloride 93, CO2 28,
BUN 54, creatinine 6.7, glucose 264.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The night of admission a thoracentesis was
performed in the right posterior thorax.  Approximately 500
cc of fluid was removed.  Also on the night of admission the
saphenectomy wound was sharply debrided, the bleeding tissue
impacted with wet to dry dressing and normal saline and the
sternal wound was sharply debrided.  The granulation tissue
was packed with wet to dry dressings and normal saline.  The
patient was empirically started on Piperacillin and
Vancomycin.  Plastic surgery was consulted, they recommended
conservative management as was being performed by general
surgery.  The patient was also seen by the renal service who
managed the patient's dialysis and electrolyte management
during the hospitalization.  PICC line was placed in
anticipation of a long course of IV antibiotics.  On 2010-10-26 00:00:00 a
VAC dressing was first placed in the wound.  The patient was
doing well on intravenous antibiotics and VAC dressing
changes.

The UPMCE hospital course faltered when at hemodialysis,
increased venous pressures were noticed on 2010-10-26 00:00:00.  On 2010-10-26 00:00:00
fistulogram revealed a clotted fistula and the patient was
unable to receive her normal dialysis on 2010-10-26 00:00:00.  Transplant
surgery saw the patient and scheduled her for revision.
During the interim, Quinton catheter was placed in the
patient's right groin for dialysis.  On the evening of
2010-10-26 00:00:00, the patient fell getting out of bed.  When the house
officer arrived, the patient was confused in bed and somewhat
difficult to arouse.  CT scan of the head performed on an
emergent basis demonstrated no intracranial pathology.
Initially the skull was intact.  The next morning the patient
was difficult to arouse and her labs reflected the fact that
she had not been dialyzed in several days with a rising BUN,
creatinine and potassium.  The patient was given Kayexalate
for the rising potassium.  A repeat CT scan of the head was
similar to the 123 Any St.us CT scan in that there was no evidence
of intracranial pathology.  At this point the patient had an
episode of bradycardia with wide QRS complexes.  She lost
consciousness.  After receiving an amp of D50 insulin and
Calcium Gluconate, the patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.  At this point her hematocrit was found
to be 13.  The patient vomited a large amount of guaiac
positive material.

In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was transfused four
units of packed red cells and 4 units of FFP.  The patient
was intubated and an NG tube was placed.  Large amount of
bloody material was aspirated from the stomach.  GI service
was consulted for an emergent EGD which revealed an enormous
amount of clot protruding from the pylorus and bright red
blood was seeping around it.  The gastroduodenal artery was
visualized in the posterior wall of the duodenum.  The
patient was given blood and FFP to maintain hematocrit and to
combat an ongoing coagulopathy.  On 2010-10-26 00:00:00 the patient went to
the interventional radiology suite and had an
angioembolization of the gastroduodenal artery.  At this
point patient was placed on Protonix and started on a course
of Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin in addition to the
Piperacillin and Vancomycin.

The patient received her dialysis in the ICU beginning on
2010-10-26 00:00:00.  During this course in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient remained intubated and was repeatedly transfused to
keep her hematocrit above 30.  By 2010-10-26 00:00:00 the patient's
mechanics were good enough to begin a wean from the
ventilator and by 2010-10-26 00:00:00 she was extubated.  By 2010-10-26 00:00:00 the
patient was transferred to the patient care floor.  The
patient continued to do well on the floor, the VAC dressing
changes to the sternum were continued and the size of the
sternal wound had decreased with time.  Additionally, the
saphenectomy sites were cared for with wet to dry dressings
which were changed over to santyl dressings twice a day.
Both wounds were intermittently debrided to reveal viable
tissue.

On 2010-10-26 00:00:00 the transplant surgery service deemed the patient
an operable candidate and brought her to the operating room
for fistular revision.  Please see 123 Any St.usly dictated
operative note for more details.

After the fistula revision the patient was able to use her
fistula for hemodialysis and the Quinton catheter was
removed.  The VAC dressing changes continued.  The UPMCE
hospital course was complicated further by a brief episode of
C. difficile colitis.  For this, the patient was treated with
Flagyl for 10 days and remained on Piperacillin and
Vancomycin.  By 2010-10-26 00:00:00 the patient was accepted to
UPMCE.  At this point patient's wounds were stable,
she had a PICC line in place, was tolerating po and was ready
to go to rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Regular insulin sliding scale as
follows: Glucose 150-200 gets 2 units, 201-250 gets 4 units,
251-300 gets 6 units, 301-150 8 units, Epogen 14,000 units q
hemodialysis, Vitamin A, D, Zinc ointment to affected area
tid, Vancomycin 500 mg IV after hemodialysis times 6 weeks,
Neurontin 500 mg po bid, Norvasc 5 mg po bid, Trazodone 100
mg po q h.s., Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Lipitor 10 mg po q
h.s., Piperacillin 3 gm IV q 8 hours for 6 more weeks,
Captopril 12.5 mg po q 8 hours, Protonix 40 mg po q day,
Miconazole powder applied to affected areas prn, Morphine
Sulfate 2 mg IV before dressing changes.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Sternal wound infection.
2.  Infection of saphenectomy site.
3.  Gastrointestinal bleed, status post embolization.
4.  C. difficile colitis.
