Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion, atrial fibrillation with RVR.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Agrawal is a 77-year old male with minimal prior medical care
for over 50 years, with no known past medical problems, who was
brought to the Chaketa Agrawal this morning by his social worker because he
was noted to have labored breathing.  He minimizes his symptoms,
and reports that he has been feeling "great" and has no
complaints.  Per his social worker, Chaketa Agrawal Chaketa Agrawal, she has noted a
deterioration in his health over the last 2 weeks.  Her main
concern has been with his balance.  He has been having trouble
maintaining his balance on ambulating for several weeks.  He has
had several falls recently due to difficulty with his balance
and has been walking with a cane for the last 3 weeks.  He
recalls his last fall to have been approximately 1 week ago.  He
denies any prodromal symptoms with this fall including no
lightheadedness, LOC, chest pain, SOB, and palpitations.   His
social worker also notes that he has had decreased a123 Any St.e with
minimal PO intake for the last few days.  She notes that on her
visit today, he looked pale and had difficulty breathing.  He
denies difficulty breathing and other complaints including no
chest pain, palpitations, SOB, orthopnea, LE edema and PND.
.
In the ED he was noted to have atrial fibrillation to 140-160s
with SBP 145/65.  He was given 5 mg IV diltiazem without
response and started on a diltiazem gtt.  He had an
echocardiogram that was done by ED staff that revealed a
pericardial effusion.  He had a formal echocardiogram that
showed a moderate pericardial effusion (2cm) and no evidence of
tamponade, though limited by suboptimal study due to RVR.  He is
being admitted to the CCU with atrial fibrillation with
difficult to control RVR on diltiazem 15 mg/hour.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

..
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST (2010-10-03 00:00:00):
There is diffuse symmetric enlargement of the ventricles and
sulci consistent with mild-to-moderate age-related atrophy.
There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
large vascular territory infarct. The Keiser Bogenreif-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Paranasal sinuses and ethmoid air
cells are normally pneumatized and clear. There is a small
heterogeneous lucency within the left parieto-occipital
calvarium (2:24). This likely represents a hemangioma. The
osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for hemorrhage or other acute
intracranial process.
.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST (2010-10-03 00:00:00):
There is asymmetric interstitial septal thickening with some
nodularity involving the entire right lung. Multiple pulmonary
nodules in the lungs are also identified measuring 8 mm (series
4:100). There is bilateral atelectasis and moderate simple
fluid-attenuating effusions. There are multiple mildly enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 12 mm(precarinal, series
4, image 96). Although evaluation is limited without contrast,
there is increased soft tissue in the right hilum concerning for
adenopathy such as increased soft tissue posterior to the right
main bronchus (series 4:125). Calcified mediastinal and small
right hilar nodes also noted. No left hilar adenopathy is
identified. There are coronary artery calcifications. Study was
not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but no
abnormalities are identified. Please note that the adrenal
glands were not imaged. No suspicious lesions are identified in
the osseous structures, which otherwise demonstrate diffuse
degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION:
1. Constellation of findings including asymmetric nodular right
lung
interstitial septal thickening, mediastinal and right hilar
adenopathy, and multiple pulmonary nodules are concerning for
possible malignant disease, but no definite primary tumor site
is identified. Consider PET CT for further assessment, if
warranted clinically.
2. Large pericardial effusion.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAM (2010-10-03 00:00:00):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears borderline depressed
(difficult to assess to very rapid and irregular pulse). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a moderate sized pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized
within the pericardial space c/w organization. No right atrial
or right ventricular diastolic colla123 Any St. seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate circumfirential pericardial effusion
without tamponade. LV/RV systolic function are preserved
(difficult to assess due to irregular and very rapid pulse)
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAM (2010-10-03 00:00:00):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized
within the pericardial space c/w organization. The effusion is
most prominent posterior to the left ventricle, with <1 cm
anterior to the right ventricle in diastole. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta. Moderate
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of 2010-10-03 00:00:00 LV function appear normal (largely
secondary to a lower ventricular response rate in atrial
fibrillation). Aortic regurgitation is slightly more prominent,
also likely secondary to longer diastolic period.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 77-year old gentleman with no prior
medical history who presents with a pericardial effusion and
atrial fibrillation with RVR.  He was started on a diltiazem
drip and admitted to the CCU for closer monitoring given his
rapid ventricular rate.
..
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  On echocardiogram, he was found to have
a moderate-sized effusion (2 cm).  Given his hemodynamic
stability, we suspected that this was a chronic process.  A
repeat echo showed little interval progression.   After
evaluation of echo findings and symptoms, we felt that the
effusion was not affecting hemodynamics in any marked way.  By
symptoms he was never hypotensive or showing clinical signs of
tamponade.
.
We checked Chaketa Keiser Bogenreif and PPD, both of which returned negative.  We
order a CT chest to evaluate his lung fields and possibly shed
light on the etiology of the pericardial effusion.  The full CT
report is above; in brief, it showed interstitial septal
thickening, as well as mediastinal LAD and pulmonary nodules,
all highly concerning for malignancy (primary site not
identified).  Thus the pericardial effusion was felt to be due
to metastatic cancer.
.
We discussed the findings with Mr. Agrawal and explained to him
that further work-up to diagnose and potentially treat his
condition would involve tissue biospy and additional imaging.
He was not interested in more work-up and expressed desire to go
home.  See below for more information.
..
# CAD/ISCHMIA:  We did not suspect ischemic disease as he had no
risk factors, symptoms or EKG changes to suggest ACS.
Furthermore, echocardiogram did not show any focal hypokinesis
or akinesis to suggest myocardial infarction.
..
# PUMP:  There were so signs of fluid overload or clinical pump
failure on physical exam.  His echocardiogram showed a normal EF
of 55-60%.
..
# RHYTHM:  He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR that
required a diltiazem drip in the emergency room.  He converted
back to sinus rhythm on the morning after admission.
Unfortunately, he returned to AF intermittently throughout his
hospital stay.  We started him on PO metoprolol and diltiazem;
however, he continued to have periods of AF with ventricular
response to 90-110s while lying in bed.  At time of discharge,
his rate is 80-100 while lying in bed and increases to 150s when
he is walking.  His systolic blood pressure and oxygen sat are
120s and mid to low 90s, respectively, during these episodes.
He remains asymptomatic.
.
We discussed starting anticoagulation, but felt that it was
unnecessary and potentially harmful in this patient with a
CHADS-2 score of 1 (age), potential medical non-compliance
(history of homelessness), and significant fall risk (history of
multiple mechanical falls in recent weeks).  We started him on
aspirin at a dose of 325 mg once daily.
..
# HISTORY OF FALLS:  History as above seemed most consistent
with mechanical falls due to balance and gait problems.  Chaketa Agrawal loss
of consciousness or cardiac prodromal symptoms to suggest
arrhythmic cause, although certainly AF could be contributing to
his generalized weakness and propensity to fall. Neurologic exam
was nonfocal and CT was negative for acute process.
.
He was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehab.  However,
he declined this option; in the end he left against medical
advice so that he could return home.  We arranged for him to
have a walker as well as home PT/OT visits and VNA visits.
.
# LOW-GRADE FEVERS / PULMONARY INFILTRATE ON CXR:  He had
persistent fevers overnight with Tm of 101.6.  Chest CT showed
no infiltrate but did show diffuse nodules and adenopathy
concerning for malignancy.  Blood and urine cultures were
negative and there were no localizing symptoms.  White count was
WNL with no bands on the differential.  No source for his fevers
was found, and he was not started on antibiotics.  Further
work-up would require tissue sample of his pericardial effusion
or mediastinal lymph nodes.  At time of discharge, he had
remained afebrile for over 24 hours.
..
# RENAL FAILURE:  Urine electrolyes were consistent with
prerenal azotemia.  His ARF resolved with IVF boluses in ED.
There were no further concerns.
..
# ANEMIA:  Iron, TSH, vitamin B12 and folate studies were
normal.  His anemia is likely secondary to marrow suppression
from his underlying process, most likely a malignancy.
..
# GOALS OF CARE:  These were discussed with Mr. Agrawal when his
underlying disease remained uncertain.  We explained that we
would need a tissue sample to definitively diagnose the cause
for his pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions.
We explained that this would likely provide an explanation for
his presenting symptoms, namely his shortness of breath and
anemia.  He was also seen by physical therapy, who noted that he
was too weak to go home and should be discharged to rehab.
However, it was clear that Mr. Agrawal wanted to return to his
home and was not interested in any invasive procedures, even if
these might reveal a potentially treatable cause for his
symptoms.  We suggested that he consider hospice care, but he
did not want to leave his home for a hospice facility.
.
Prior to leaving, he signed an AMA form.  Eventhough he returns
home against medical advice, he has agreed to have VNA come
visit him, as well as PT/OT, meals on wheels, and elderly
services.  We have provided home oxygen if he needs it during
activities, although his O2 sats have been fine on RA when
walking with walker.  He has confirmed his code status is
DNR/DNI.
..
# He was given a regular diet.  Subcutaneous heparin was used
for DVT prophylaxis.  Code status was discussed and at his
request he was made DNR/DNI.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation, a
irregular fast heart rhythm. We treated this rhythm with
medications to slow down your heart rate. You have a collection
of fluid around your heart and lungs, called effusions.  We
asked you if you would agree to the removal of this fluid with a
needle and you indicated you didn't want this done. You also
have some nodules in your lungs that likely are cancer. You have
told us that you don't want to have any more diagnostic tests or
treatments.
.
We are sending you home and have asked a nurse to come to your
house to check your blood pressure and heart rate so we know if
the medicines are working.
.
Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on
METOPROLOL and DILTIAZEM, two medications to help keep you out
of a fast heart rate.
.
Please take all of your medicines as instructed as they will
help you feel better. Please call Dr. Keiser Bogenreif
if you have more trouble breathing and the oxygen does not help,
if you have chest pain or pressure, if you feel dizzy or weak.
