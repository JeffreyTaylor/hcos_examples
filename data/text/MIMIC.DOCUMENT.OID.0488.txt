REASON FOR EXAM: 73-year-old man status post redo sternotomy,
AVR, CABG,
pacemaker.
Since 2006-10-19 00:00:00, left-sided pacemaker ends in expected
position. Prior sternotomy for CABG is again seen. Small
bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis decreased,
now minimal. There is no volume overload.
Incidentally, DISH of the thoracic spine is unchanged.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  4.7 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  30% to 40%  >= 55%
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Moderate global LV hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis initially with bradycardia (LVEF =
30%) that improves with pacing to 80/min (LVEF 40%).. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is seen with good leaflet motion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen (focused color Doppler). The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No definite mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Eun was admitted one day prior to his surgery to be
started on Heparin (he d/c'd Coumadin 4 days prior to admission)
and undergo complete pre-operative work-up. On 2006-10-19 00:00:00 he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a
redo-sternotomy, coronary artery bypass graft x 1, and aortic
valve replacement. Please see operative report for surgical
details. In summary he had a redo sternotomy with AVR(#21
UPMCE Mosaic porcine) and CABGx1(SVG-Pda). His bypass time
was 94 minutes with a crossclamp of 65 minutes. he tolerated the
operation well and following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. In the
immediate post-op period he remained hemodynamically stable, his
anesthesia was reversed he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Endocrine/Inserra were
consulted post-op to assist with patients poor diabetes control
(recent A1C 8%). On post-op day one he was started on beta
blockers and diuretics. On POD2 he was transferred from the ICU
to the stepdown floor for continued care. Once on the floor he
had several episodes of atrial fibrillation which were treated
with Beta blockers. Following beta blockade Mr Inserra had
symptomatic bradycardia and was transferred back to the ICU for
closer monitoring, EP service was consulted and a permenant
pacemaker was placed on 2006-10-19 00:00:00.
On POD7/1 he was again transferred to the stepdown floor. Over
the next several days the patients activity level was advanced
and he was anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation. On POD
2006-10-19 00:00:00 he was discharged home with visiting nurses. His INR is to
be drawn by the VNA on 2006-10-19 00:00:00 and coumadin dosing is to be
followed by Dr Inserra.
