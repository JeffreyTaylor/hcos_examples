Chief Complaint:
constipation w/ inability to void- developed chest pain in ER

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
2008-04-19 00:00:00 urgent CABG x2 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA)

History of Present Illness:
76M h/o Diabetes, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, h/o CVA, elevated
PSA, on warfarin arrives with 5 days of inability to void and
7day h/o constipation. Poor historian with reported poor follow
up history in chart and unclear about what meds he takes at
home. Tried suppositories and laxatives without effect initially
but then states that he had small BM yesterday at home. Last
colonoscopy was over 10 yrs ago per pt. Arrived in ED because he
states Dr. Kinnaman was not in office - he mainly arrives with c/o
urinary retention. Of note, it appears that he was on flomax in
past and has been referred to urology for w/u with elevated PSA
around 6, but he states he is no longer taking this med. He also
failed to f/u with urology for prostate bx. Denies abd pain,
n/v, or any other sx.
In ED, vitals were 98.8, 57, 124/61, 16, 97% RA. KUB consistant
with constipation, no stool in rectum. Foley was placed and
urine relieved. Given enema with another small BM, pt states
that now his bowels are relieved. Labs notable for Cr 1.5
(baseline 1.1), Na slightly elevated to 146 c/w dehydration. On
transfer from ED to floor, pt was comfortable, without pain, and
only concerned for urinary retention.
During the course of his hospitalization, he experienced chest
pain and shortness of breath. His pain was reported to radiate
from to his throat and resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin
and oxygen administration. ECG demonstrated LBBB with ST
depressions in II and AVF which resolved. CE Tn 0.02 -> 0.08 ->
0.14. CK 174 -> 178 -> 138. Cardiac cath deferred until INR
decreased from 3.3. He was clopidogrel loaded with 300mg.
Cardiac cath demonstrated severe 3 vessel CAD with single
remaining vessel with 90% left main supplying LAD and
collateralized RCA. PCI deferred for surgical evaluation.
On arrival to the CCU the patient is resting comfortably. He
currently denies shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, PND
or orthopnea. He denies palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness
or syncope. All other review of systems were negative.
Cardiac cath done 2008-04-19 00:00:00 with 3VD and referred for surgery.

FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to diffuse bowel gas. Within
these
limitations, the liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
There are
gallstones, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis. Incidental
note is made
of several tiny probable cholesterol polyps. Pancreas is
completely obscured
by bowel gas. Spleen is not well visualized. The right kidney
measures 11.4
cm, left kidney measures 13.8 cm. Though partially obscured by
bowel gas,
neither kidney shows evidence of stone or solid mass. Abdominal
aorta is
obscured by bowel gas. Main portal vein is patent, with
appropriate antegrade
flow.

IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to diffuse bowel gas.
Cholelithiasis, without
evidence of cholecystitis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Kinnaman was admitted to the UPMCE on 2008-04-19 00:00:00 for further
management of his non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He was
taken to the cardiac catheterization lab and found severe three
vessel disease. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical service was 2008-04-19 00:00:00 and he was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. The urology service was 2008-04-19 00:00:00 as he had
recent progression of his voiding difficulty over last week. He
was on flomax in the past and seen by urology for irregularly
nodular prostate concerning for cancer, but he never followed-up
for biopsy. He had an elevated PSA 6.7 in 2008-04-19 00:00:00 and now 10.9
although may be falsely elevated due to urinary retention and
foley placement. It was recommended that his foley in and
followup in clinic for further evaluation. Flomax was resumed.
On 2008-04-19 00:00:00 Mr. Kinnaman was subsequently transferred to the CCU
where he had chest pain, initially controlled on nitro drip and
subsequently developed angina refractory to nitroglycerin and
morphine.
The cardiac surgical service was called and he went emergently
to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to two vessels on 2008-04-19 00:00:00. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. On postoperative day one, diminished right arm
and bilateral leg movement was noted. The neurology service was
2008-04-19 00:00:00 and a CT scan was performed which showed No acute
intracranial hemorrhage or edema but sequelae of remote left MCA
territory infarct was noted. Aspirin and statin were recommended
and started along with betablockade and diuresis. An MRI was
performed that showed wide spread cortical areas of restricted
diffusion involving all lobes, and more extensive cortical and
subcortical areas of restricted diffusion within the left
occipital lobe and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, are
compatible with laminar necrosis and acute embolic disease.
Heparin was started with bridge to coumadin. The vascular
surgery service was 2008-04-19 00:00:00 for ischemic fingers and
recommended topical nitrates and to continue heparin for likely
microemolic events. He was extubated on POD#2 but required
re-intubation due to impaired gag and inability to clear
secretions. He was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotics for
GNR in sputum and +U/A. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per protocol on POD#3. The general surgery service was
2008-04-19 00:00:00 for placement of a PEG feeding tube for long term
nutrition. PICC line was placed under floroscopy w/ tip in upper
SVC on 2008-04-19 00:00:00. He developed atrial fibrillation which was
treated w/ betablocker and amio- he is now in SR. On 2008-04-19 00:00:00
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was
performed. As he continued to have Respiratory failure on
mechanical ventilation with questionable aspiration pneumonia
requiring almost daily bronchosocopy for secretion management,
the thoracic surgery service was 2008-04-19 00:00:00 for placement of a
tracheostomy. This was performed on 2008-04-19 00:00:00 along with rigid
bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy and therapeutic aspiration
of tracheobronchial tree. On 2008-04-19 00:00:00 Mr. Kinnaman suffered a
respiratory arrest from presumed mucous plugging. He was
successfully resusitated. During the course of his
hopsitalization Mr. Kinnaman developed an unstageable pressure
ulcer on his coccyx maesuring 4x4 cm for which the wound care
nurse Coralline Kinnaman. A Mepilex sacral border dressing was
applied. Neurologically he remains able to move upper
extremities but has no lower extremity function. He continued to
work with physical therapy and occupational therapy. He is
currently tolerating  trach mask for greater than 24hrs.
Antibiotics were stopped on 2008-04-19 00:00:00 after subsequent negative
culture data. Vancomycin was initiated 2008-04-19 00:00:00 for a 7 day course
prophylactically for his right lower extremity incision site
which appears mildly erythematous. On 2008-04-19 00:00:00 per Dr.Kinnaman,
Mr. Kinnaman was cleared for discharge to rehabilitation. All
follow up appointments were advised.
