Attending:Zaley Kurtz
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and distention


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
24yo from UPMCE rehab with h/o HTN, osteoperosis, and chronic
resp failure 2012-07-18 00:00:00 to parkinson's disease, trached and peged d/t
multiple aspiration events admitted for abdominal distension x 7
days and LLQ abdominal pain.
.
The patient has a several-year history of bowel difficulty
attribtued to parkinson's disease and medication side-effect.
Now he presents with 7 days of abdominal distention and RLQ
abdominal pain relieved intermitently by bowel movements. Worse
over last 2 days. No emesis or fevers.  The patient has been
followed at UPMCE rehab where KUB on 2012-07-18 00:00:00 showed mildly dilated
bowel with increased gas. In UPMCE rehab, erythromycin was
started to promote peristalsis and a flexiseal was placed.  The
patient had a large black guiac neg BM on day of admission but
continued to complain of abdominal discomfort.
.
Of note on 2012-07-18 00:00:00 was seen in UPMCE ED for leg pain and swelling as
well as abdominal pain. HCT was baseline. LENI was neg for DVT.
CT was initially read as unremarkable. Patient was d/c'ed to
rehab, final read identified new left anterior iliac bone
fracture. At rehab patient was noted to be in considerable pain
and grimacing with minimal manipulations. He was given ultram
for pain control.  He was initially on prophylactic lovenox but
this was d/c'ed after Hct of 23.2 on 2012-07-18 00:00:00 down from 27.2 on 2012-07-18 00:00:00,
for which he recieved 1 unit of PRBC.
.
On admission to ED, VS were 99.7 60 129/46 20 99%.  Labs showed
UA leukocytes +++, Bacteria +++; ABG 7.36/45/84; Cr/BUN 1.1/14
(from 2012-07-18 00:00:00 2012-07-18 00:00:00 and 0.7/23 2012-07-18 00:00:00); lactate 1.0.  The patient did
not have a leukocytosis.  He was given IV morphine 4mg + 6mg.

.
Portable abdomen:  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Interposition of colon between the abdominal wall and the liver.
There is gas marking and mild distention of the ascending,
transverse and descending colon. Gas marking of at least two
small bowel loops. No radiographic evidence of bowel wall
thickening. No pathological air-fluid levels. The rectum cannot
be assessed because of contrast material in the bladder.
.
Chest Portable for line placement:  As compared to the 123 Any St.us
radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided PICC line.
The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line
projects over the inflow tract of the right atrium. No
complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise unchanged
radiograph.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast:
1. No evidence for obstruction; gastrostomy tube positioned
within the
stomach. However, the balloon is oriented towards pylorus which
is approaches within 2-3 cm, so intermittent prolapse more
distally toward the pylorus could be a potential cause of
intermittent obstruction which could be considered clinically.

2. Stable appearance of fractures.
3. Marked bony demineralization.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Pelvic X-Ray:  Assessment of fine detail is markedly limited by
osteopenia underpenetration and overlying soft tissues. In
addition, the bladder is opacified by contrast and obscures the
sacrum. There is suggestion of a nondisplaced fracture involving
left superior and inferior pubic rami. The known left iliac Zaley Kurtz
fracture is not well visualized on this examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 year old from UPMCE rehab with osteoperosis and parkinson's
disease, trached and peged d/t multiple aspiration events,
admitted for abdominal distension and pain.  The patient was
admitted to the MICU due to trach with chronic ventilator
dependence.

# abdominal distension/pelvic pain: The patient was admitted
with abdominal distention, pain, and evidence of ileus on
abdominal X-ray.  He was also found to have 2 left pelvic
fractures (one new, one old comminuted).  Pain and distention
are likely due to fractures and constipation.  The patient was
seen by GI, who felt that constipation is most likely due to
medication effect (ultram, sinemet) and avoidence of increasing
abdominal pressure due to pain from his pelvic fractures. The
patient underwent CT scan with PO contrast, that did not show
evidence of intestinal obstruction.  He was started on an
intensive bowel regimen that increased his stool output.  He was
then transitioned to his home bowel regimen.  Abdominal pain
improved.
.
# Pelvic fractures: On admission, patient was found to have a
new nondisplaced fracture involving left superior and inferior
pubic rami. He also had a known left iliac Zaley Kurtz fracture.
Patient continued to produce urine through his condom cath, with
minimal free fluid in pelvis per CT.  He was seen by orthopedics
who recommended conservative management of fractures -
weight-bearing as tolerated, pain control.  His pain was
controlled with oxycodone and acetaminophen.  He was started on
calcium, vitamin D, and was given 1 dose of IV bisphosphonate.
Patient may transfer from bed to chair.
.
# UTI:  On admission, patient was found to have a urinary tract
infection.  It returned positive for resistant E. Coli.  He was
started on a 7 day course of ceftriaxone on 2012-07-18 00:00:00.  He will
complete 6 days of ceftriaxone upon discharge.
.
# Elevated troponin: Patient was admitted with a troponin of
0.08, and CK-MB of 3.  Positive trop likely 2012-07-18 00:00:00 to low GFR. The
patient did not have ischemic symptoms throughout admission.  He
does have chronic ECG changes.  Troponin and CK-MB remained
stable throughout admission.
.
# respiratory: Patient chronically trached.  He was continued on
home ventilator settings throughout admission with no
respiratory difficulties.  He was continued on home nebulizer
treatments.
.
# Parkinson's disease: Chronic.  Patient with severe dysphagia
and tracheostomy.  He was continued on home parkinson's
medications.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Bieler,

You were admitted to the UPMCE ICU for abdominal pain. You were
found to have a new pelvic fracture and an old pelvic fracture
on your left side.  You were seen by orthopedic surgery, who
recommended pain control managment of your fractures.  Per
orthopedics, you may transfer from bed to chair with your hip
fractures.  You were also found to have some constipation.  You
underwent imaging studies that showed no evidence of bowel
obstruction.  You were seen by gastroenterology, who felt that
your constipation may be a cumulative side effect of some of
your medications.  However, these medications are important for
your parkinson's disease.  You were put on an intensified
bowel-regimen for your constipation, then transitioned to your
home regimen.  On admission, we also diagnosed you with a
urinary tract infection, and we started you on a 7 day course of
ceftriaxone.  While in the hospital, you only completed one day
of your ceftriaxone.  You should continue 6 more days when you
go back to UPMCE.

Medication changes made on admission:
START ceftriaxone x 6 days
START calcium carbonate
START cholecalciferol
START 5% lidocaine patch to left hip for pain - change daily
START oxydocone 5mg by G-tube every 4 hours as needed for pain
START tylenol 650 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed for pain
START morphine 5 mg IV every 4 hours as needed for pain - use
for breakthrough pain
STOP ultram


Followup Instructions:
You are being discharged to a medical facility.  Please follow
up with your medical doctors at your facility.  Please follow up
with Dr. Giacomin at your earliest convenience.
