Chief Complaint:
s/p VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A-line placement

History of Present Illness:
75 yo female with DM presenting with VF arrest.  Per patient's
husband, patient was at home with her husband this morning.
Husband was outside walking the dog, and when he walked in heard
his wife call out for him then heard her collapse.  He was at
her side immediately, could not feel a pulse.  He gave her
glucagon as she has a history of hypoglycemia, with no effect.
He called 911 within 5-10 minutes of finding her down.  911
responded within 2 minutes and defibrillated immediately.  She
received three rounds of epinephrine, intubated and started on
dopamine gtt.
.
Initial vital signs in ED were HR 120, BP 75/p.  EKG showed afib
with rate 123 Any St. depressions in V1-V5.  Initial labs showed
no leukocytosis, normal hematocrit and were significant for a pH
of 7.17, lactate of 8.8, bicarb of 16 and glucose of 178.
Patient was given a lidocaine bolus and started on a drip.  She
was also given levophed for further pressure support in addition
to dopamine drip.  She was seen by cardiology and given an
amiodarone bolus and drip for rate control.  Post cardiac arrest
hypothermia protocol was initiated.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient's VS were HR90 in SR with
frequent PVCs, BP 111/55 on levophed (dopamine was discontinued
prior to transfer).
.
According to husband, patient had no recent complaints of chest
pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  She has known cardiac history.  She is a type I
diabetic and has neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy.  She is
legally blind.

Lactate 8.8
INR 1.1
pH 7.17

EKG (2005-08-07 00:00:00 @10:26): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, ST depressions in V1-V4 with widening of the QRS
(144ms).

EKG (2005-08-07 00:00:00 @10:55): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, ST depressions in V1-V6 with ST elevations in II, III,
avF.

Head CT (2005-08-07 00:00:00): 1. No acute intracranial process.

CXR (2005-08-07 00:00:00): No acute intrathoracic process.

Echo (2005-08-07 00:00:00):  Mild to moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction
consistent with inferior ischemia/infarction. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

EEG (2005-08-07 00:00:00): Burst suppression with seizure activity


Brief Hospital Course:
75yo female with Type I diabetes s/p ventricular arrest now on
post-arrest hypothermia protocol.
.
#s/p VF arrest:  Underlying cause of VF arrest is unclear at
this time.  EKG was concerning for potential RCA infarction vs
vasospasm. Patient treated for acute coronary syndrome given
questionable EKG with Prahl, [**First Name3 (LF) **] and heparin gtt.  It is
possible that she had an arrhythmia.  Patient has no history of
arrhythmia and electrolytes were all normal on arrival.
Patient's last fingerstick prior to event was 73, so unlikely to
have been related to hypoglycemia.  Patient was pulseless for at
least 5-10 minutes prior to defibrillation.  On arrival to the
ED, she was cooled with artic hypothermia protocol.  She
continued to have lots of ectopy with tachycardia. She initially
required amiodarone gtt but returned to sinus rhythm. EEG showed
burst suppression with seizure activity.  Patient was given a
loading dose of valproic acid.  Patient was rewarmed after 24
hours of cooling. Following rewarming patient was in status
epilepticus.  Neurology was consulted and determined that the
patient had a very poor likelihood of having a neurologic
recovery.  Coffy Prahl husband Coffy Prahl decided to make patient Coffy Prahl.
Pressure support was withdrawn at this time.  Patient was
continued on fentanyl for pain, propofol for sedation and ativan
for suppression of seizure activity.  Ventilation support was
withdrawn and the electrical activity was no longer seen on the
monitor.  Death was confirmed with absence of corneal reflex,
pupillary response, withdrawal to painful stimuli, as well as
absence of breath sounds and cardiac sounds while auscultating
for 60 seconds.

#Hypotension: Patient has required pressure support since she
was found down.  She is currently on levophed.  This is likely
due to cardiogenic shock in the setting of stunning myocardium.
As above, patient's pressure was supported with levophed.  An
arterial line was placed for close hemodynamic monitoring.  When
the decision was made for patient to be comfort measures,
levophed was discontinued.

#Type I diabetes: Patient is on lantus 14-15U qAM at home.
Blood sugars were controlled with home lantus dose in addition
to an insulin drop.
