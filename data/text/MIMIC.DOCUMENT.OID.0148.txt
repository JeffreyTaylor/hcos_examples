Brief Hospital Course:
Patient tolerated lap RYGBP and CCY and was transferred to PACU.
On night of POD0, patient was nauseous refractory to Zofran,
Compazine, and Phenergan. Subsequently her PCA was changed from
MSO4 to Dilaudid and she was provided a Scopolamine patch. Later
in the night, patient desat'ed to 79% on RA with continued
nausea. In AM of POD1, patient was transferred to T-SICU for
hypoxia. CTA of chest was done and demonstrated no PE, but
evidence of bilateral consolidation. CT abdomen demonstrated no
obvious leak.  She was started on IV antibiotics for question
aspiration pneumonia. After being seen by Dr. Adriene Schifrin in SICU,
team decided to take patient back to OR for laparoscopic
exploration to rule out leak. No leak was found in OR. Patient
tolerated procedure well and was back in PACU. She was
transferred to floor without incident. Post-op course was
unremarkable thereafter. On 2010-08-21 00:00:00, she was started on Stage I and
