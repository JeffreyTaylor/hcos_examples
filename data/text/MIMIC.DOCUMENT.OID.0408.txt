History of Present Illness:
Mr. Zakiya Steiner is a 24yo M from UPMCE Rehab baseline Alert and
Orientedx3 , h/o Parkinson's s/p trach, multiple aspiration
events, HTN who was having BM today at Rehab, became cyanotic,
pulseless and recieved chest compressions. He was never shocked
or given meds but had return of spontaneous circulation at
rehab. On arrival to the ED, he was put on vent for poor resp
effort. Was making non-purposeful spont mvmts. EKG showed sinus
bradycardia. Labs were unremarkable with a lactate of 2.0. Prior
to leaving the ED, he is following commands, communicating with
his wife by motioning. He is complaining of pain in ribs. Also
in the ED, CT head 123 Any St.inarily read as not acute intracranial
process, CXR with RUL and RML infiltrates c/w aspiration. He was
hemodynamically stable and cooling protocol was not initiated as
he was neurologically improving. No meds were given in ED except
for 1L NS.

On arrival to the ICU, we was responding to commands and c/o
left sided rib pain.

Review of systems: Pt unable to answer extensive ROS at this
time.

Imaging:

Head CT (2009-04-20 00:00:00):
No acute intracranial process.

Echo (2009-04-20 00:00:00):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. RV with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2009-04-20 00:00:00, no definite change.

CTA chest (2009-04-20 00:00:00):
1)No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2)Bibasilar atelectasis and secretions in the lower lobes
bilaterally could be due to aspiration.
3)Multifocal consolidation in the lower lobes and left upper
lobe to a lesser extent is most likely pneumonia.
4)Small right pneumothorax with pigtail catheter in situ.
5)Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes in addition to granulomas in
the liver and spleen are most likely due to prior granulomatous
exposure.

Abd/pelvis CT (2009-04-20 00:00:00):
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
2. No complications of 2009-04-20 00:00:00 placement are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 24yo M from UPMCE Rehab baseline Alert and Orientedx3
, h/o Parkinson's s/p trach, multiple aspiration events, HTN who
was having BM at Rehab, became cyanotic, pulseless and recieved
chest compressions.

# Shock: The patient required dopa infusion at the beginning of
his hospital stay. No organisms grew in his blood, however, he
did have a multifocal pneumonia. A subclavian line was placed
for better access and hemodynamic monitoring. The patient was
noted to have a low CVP so he was given intermittent boluses of
normal saline. In addition, he was continued on antibiotics for
some component of septic shock, though he never had high
lactates.

# Respiratory failure with multifocal ventilator associated
pneumonia: The patient has a tracheostomy at baseline and uses
ventilator support at night. The patient was noted to have
increased secretions, increased needs on his ventilator,
infiltrates in the RML/RUL and a trach cuff UPMCE. He was
empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime for treatment of
pneumonia. A bronchoscopy was done to clear the secretions and
grew a resistant form of pseudomonas. Despite therapy with
cefepime, the patient still continued to grow pseudomonas in his
sputum. Tobramycin nebulizers were added to his regimen 2009-04-20 00:00:00.
Despite the use of these antibiotics, the patient still required
higher assisted control ventilation. In addition, he had a trach
cuff Bieler, [**First Name3 (LF) **] his trach was switched and the [**First Name3 (LF) 3515**] resolved. The
patient should continue Cefepime until 2009-04-20 00:00:00, and the Giacomin Bieler
nebs should continue for at least another week afterwards
(~2009-04-20 00:00:00). Pt also with a component of fluid overload, as he
received IVF on initial resuscitation. Diuresing gently with
Lasix - can likely d/c Lasix in several days when patient is
euvolemic.

# s/p cardiac arrest: The patient presented s/p cardiac arrest
from his living facility. He had chest compressions in the
process. Reportedly, the patient's mental status returned to
baseline shortly after compressions, so he did not undergo a
cooling protocol. Since he quickly returned back to his
baseline, it was felt that his cardiac event was most likely due
to mucous plugging leading to hypoxia and compressions displaced
the mucous plug. A pulmonary embolus was ruled out on CTA of the
chest.

# Pneumothorax: The patient developed a pneumothorax, most
likely due to chest compressions during his cardiac arrest.
Interventional pulmonology placed a dart catheter to suction.
The pneumothorax improved and the catheter was eventually pulled
on 2009-04-20 00:00:00.

# Rib fractures: The patient sustained rib fractures after chest
compressions. He continued to have pain in the area. He required
a lidocaine patch, fentanyl patch, and PRN fentanyl IV doses to
control his pain.

# Abdominal pain: The patient reported diffuse abdominal pain
that was tender to palpation. His G tube was leaking, so a CT of
the abdomen and pelvis were done to rule out an associated
abscess. The CT did not show any pathology. Per the records from
UPMCE Rehab, the patient has a history of chronic abdominal
pain. Also possible that the pain is secondary to the rib
fractures sustained during CPR.

# G tube: The patient had his UPMCE replaced by GI on 2009-04-20 00:00:00.
Tube feeds can be restarted.

# Eye infection: Treated with Sulfacetamide eye drops, course to
end 2009-04-20 00:00:00.

# Constipation: Pt had difficulty with bowel movements while
hospitalized and on Fentanyl for pain control. He was given
Colace, Senna, Miralax, and Lactulose. Please assess for bowel
movements daily and discontinue Lactulose as tolerated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. Bieler,
.
You were admitted to the hospital after you were found to be
pulseless and received chest compressions.
.
In the hospital, you were found to have pneumonia. You have been
started on antibiotics, which should be continued until 2009-04-20 00:00:00.

.
You had a pneumothorax, which is abnormal air in your lung
cavity that makes the lung collapse. You had a chest tube
placed, and the lung has now re-expanded.
.
The increased chest and abdominal pain are likely secondary to
the rib fractures that you sustained with CPR. You are currently
on medications to help control the pain.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
#. START Cefepime 2g every 24 hours until 2009-04-20 00:00:00
#. START Tobramycin inhalers twice daily until 2009-04-20 00:00:00
#. START Lidocaine and Fentanyl patches to help with pain
#. START Lasix 20mg daily until you are no longer fluid
overloaded
#. TAKE Sulfacetamide drops in your left eye for two more days
#. START lactulose which should likely be discontinued soon
#. Increased Tramadol to 50mg q4hrs
.
It was a pleasure meeting you and taking part in your care.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care physician at your living
facility.
