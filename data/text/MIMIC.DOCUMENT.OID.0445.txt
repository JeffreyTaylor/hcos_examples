Pertinent Results:
2007-10-03 00:00:00 Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with thinning and dyskinesis of the basilar
inferrior and inferolateral walls.. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. POSTBYPASS: LV systolic function
is marginally improved (LVEF-45-50%) 123 Any St.us wall motion
abnormalities persist. RV systolic function remains normal.
Study is otehrwise unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Gutowski was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On the day of admission
he was brought directly to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on operative day one, he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. He was then
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. Mr.
Gutowski was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He
remained stable post-operatively and worked with physical
therapy for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. Beta blockers were increased for heart rate and blood
pressure control. He developed atrial fibrillation which was
treated with an increase in his beta blockade. He progressed
well and was discharged home with VNA services on 2007-10-03 00:00:00. He
will follow-up with Dr. Gutowski, his cardiologist and his
primary care physician as an outpatient.
