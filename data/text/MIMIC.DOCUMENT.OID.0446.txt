HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General
Surgery Service on 2013-05-01 00:00:00 and underwent an uncomplicated
open gastric bypass surgery with open cholecystectomy.

The patient's postoperative course was notable for persistent
hypotension with stout pressure in the 80s requiring fluid
boluses in order to maintain appropriate pressure and urine
output.  An electrocardiogram was obtained, and the was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction.

She spent the following day in the Intensive Care Unit where
she was closely hemodynamically monitored.  She subsequently
came out of the unit on postoperative day three and had a
relatively benign remainder of her hospital stay.

On postoperative day two, she underwent a transesophageal
echocardiogram that demonstrated decreased left atrial
velocities, but no other abnormalities.

She remained afebrile, and on postoperative three was
restarted on her hydrochlorothiazide.  Her intravenous fluids
were hep-locked, and her diet was advanced to a stage II.
Her patient-controlled analgesia was discontinued, and she
was initiated on oral pain medications which controlled her
pain adequately.

By postoperative four, the patient was tolerating a stage II
diet, was passing gas, and was advanced to a stage III diet.
Her Foley had been discontinued midnight the night before,
and she was voiding without difficulty.  Per the
recommendations of the Electrophysiology fellow, the patient
was initiated on Coumadin for her new onset of atrial
