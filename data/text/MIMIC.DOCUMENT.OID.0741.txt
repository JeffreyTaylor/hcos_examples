Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the 123 Any St. (123 Any St.es) **] 123 Any St.es) **] LAA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Moderately dilated descending
aorta Ascending aortic intimal flap/dissection.. Aortic arch
intimal flap/dissection. Descending aorta intimal flap/aortic
dissection. Thickened aortic wall c/w intramural hematoma.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. A mobile density is seen
in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile
density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an
intimal flap/aortic dissection. The aortic wall is thickened
consistent with an intramural hematoma. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no inotropic support
post-CPB. There is an ascending aorta tube graft seen distal to
the sinotubular junction without any changes to the aortic
valve. Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all
other findings are consistent with pre-CPB findings. All
findings were communicated to the surgeon intraoperatively.

Reason: eval for effusion



UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
   92 year old woman s/p aortic dissection repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for effusion



Wet Read: AGLc FRI 2012-04-04 00:00:00 1:10 AM
slightly wider apperance to mediastinum may again be in part due
to
differences in pt rotation. else no change in moderate Lt, small
Rt pleural
effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.


Final Report
CHEST

HISTORY: Status post aortic dissection. Re-evaluation of
effusion.

COMPARISON: 2012-04-04 00:00:00.

Compared to the prior study the diameter of the mediastinum has
increased
slightly from 130 mm to 137 mm. This may be due to differences
in technique.
The right IJ line has been removed. There are bilateral pleural
effusions,
left greater than right, which are stable. The visualized lungs
are stable as
well.

IMPRESSION: Slight increase in the size of the diameter of the
mediastinum.
This may be positional.

Otherwise stable pleural effusions.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 92-year-old Russian speaking patient with sudden onset
chest pain radiating to the back presented to the emergency room
where CT angiogram demonstrated a type A acute dissection
involving the ascending aorta without involvement of the arch or
the descending. She has a known history of ascending aortic
aneurysm. She was hemodynamically stable and was taken
emergently to the operating room for surgery with Dr.Amadeus Fremder.
 She underwent repair of acute type A aortic dissection with
ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement with a size 26
Gelweave graft/Aortic valve resuspension. Please see operative
report for further details. She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CVICU for further invasive monitoring.
Hemodynamic support with Inotropes/pressors were initially
required. She was grossly volume overloaded and a Lasix drip was
initiated. Over the next few days she slowly improved and drips
were weaned off. She was extubated on 2012-04-04 00:00:00 and remained in the
CVICU for altered mental status-confusion, hiflo oxygen for
hypoxemia, and decompression of gastric dilitation.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis continued. She
continued to improve and on POD# 10 Ms.Filipowicz was
transferred to the step unit for further monitoring. Physical
therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
On POD# 14 Dr.Harveer cleared her for discharge to UPMCE
for rehabilitation.  She will be seen by Dr. Harveer in follow up
on 2012-04-04 00:00:00 @ 1:30PM. All appointments were advised.
