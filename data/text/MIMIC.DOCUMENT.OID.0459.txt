123 Any St.inary Report Small bilateral pleural effusions are
smaller. Lungs are clear. Heart size normal. Thoracic aorta
generally large but not focally dilated. Slight misalignment of
the lower four sternal wires with respect to the upper three has
been a constant feature since surgery. The wires are intact and
there has been no interval displacement. No pneumothorax.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic root. Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Critical AS (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears to
be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. Hope was notified in person of the results before
surgical incision..
POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve bioprosthesis is stable, functioning well with
a residual mean gradient of 3 mm of Hg.
Mild MR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr Hope was a same day admission to the operating room for
aortic valve replacement with Dr Hope. Please see the
operative report for details, in summary he had:
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 27-mm UPMCE Ultra Aortic
Valve Bioprosthesis.
2. Epiaortic duplex scanning.
His CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME was 108 minutes, with a
CROSS-CLAMP TIME of 90 minutes. He tolerated the operation well
and was transferred post-operatively to the cardiac surgery ICU
in stable condition.
He remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op
period, woke neeurologically intact and was extubated. He
remained hemodynamically stable throughout the operative day and
on POD1 was transferred to the stepdown floor for continued
post-operative care. He was noted to have several bursts of
atrial fibrillation for which he was started on BBlockers,
amiodarone and anticoagulation. All tubes lines and drains were
removed per cardiac surgery protocol. Once on the floor he had
an umeventful post-op course. He worked with nursin and physical
therapy to increase his strength and endurance and by POD6 was
ready for discharge home with a visiting nurse. He is to follow
up with Dr Hope in 1 month . Dr Aiham will follow INR and dose
Coumadin.
