History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Gruszka is a 34 year old woman with a history of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, SVT, s/p PEA arrest
x3, s/p pericardial effusion/window who was transferred to UPMCE
from UPMCE Hospital for CHF exacerbation and work up for
constrictive pericarditis.  She reports she developed bilateral
back pain with inspiration about 2 days ago that is consistent
with her prior CHF exacerbation. She also reports that she
noticed that her face and lips became cyanotic with exertion at
home. Of note, she reports she has a baseline variable 02
requirement at home from 0-2L. She otherwise denies f/c/change

pain/n/v/d/c/melena/brbpr, paresthesias/weakness.
.
At UPMCE Hospital, she underwent CT angiogram that was
negative for PE. She was treated for CHF exacerbation with
diuresis. She was noted to be bradycardic to the 40's and
amiodarone briefly dc'd. She had a CT scan of the chest showing
hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. RHC showed question of
constrictive pericarditis with equalization of diastolic
pressures in all four Kadarius Lynner (RAP 27, RVP 25, wedge 27).
.
During this hospitalization at the UPMCE, she had multiple
bursts of SVT to HR 150s-160s.  Most recently this morning she
had several minutes of SVT to 160s x 3.  During these episodes,
she was noted to have undopplerable blood pressure per report.
She was treated with carotid massage and converted to her native
rhythm.  She was also given 1 L of IVF with SBP 100.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:

Pertinent Results:
EKG (2013-11-10 00:00:00) demonstrated atrial tachycardia to 164, left
axis deviation, RBBB, biatrial enlargement.
..
CXR PA AND LAT (2013-11-10 00:00:00):
FINDINGS: Two views of the chest are compared to 2013-11-10 00:00:00.
There are bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions (right
greater than left), but much improved from 2013-11-10 00:00:00. There is
a cephalization of engorged pulmonary vasculature, but no overt
pulmonary edema. There is no new
superimposed consolidative process identified. Cardiomegaly and
mediastinal
contours are stable.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral loculated pleural effusions, improved from
2013-11-10 00:00:00.  Mild pulmonary overload, but no overt interstitial
edema.
..
CARDIAC MRI (2013-11-10 00:00:00):
IMPRESSION:
1. The pericardium demonstrates patchy late gadolinium
enhancement and maybe tethered to the myocardium; the
pericardial thickness is normal. Abnormal septal motion was not
seen. Together, these findings are consistent with but not
diagnostic of constrictive pericarditis.
2. Moderate asymmetric hypertrophy with mildly depressed
biventricular
function due to septal akinesis.
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
4. Moderate to severe biatrial enlargement.
5. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Patchy opacity is noted
in the right middle lobe. Correlation with other chest imaging
studies is advised.
..
ENDOMYOCARDIAL BIOPSY (2013-11-10 00:00:00):
DIAGNOSIS:
Heart, intraventricular septum, biopsy (A):  Cardiomyocyte
disarray, hypertrophy and increased amount of interstitial
fibrosis consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Thickening of the endocardium present.  All findings could
account for clinical picture.  No evidence of amyloid or
inflammation.  Masson trichrome done.
..
CORONARY CATH (2013-11-10 00:00:00):
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD, LCx,
and RCA were free of apparent flow-limiting lesions.
2. Resting hemodyamics revealed moderately elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures (RA mean and RVEDP both 28 mm Hg, and PCWP
mean 40 mm
Hg, LVEDP 33 mm Hg, respectively). There were prominent x and y
descents
and concordance of left and right ventricular pressures with
respiration, consistent with restriction. Pulmonary pressures
were
moderately elevated (PASP 59 mm Hg). Cardiac index was mildly
depressed
at 1.6 l/min/m2. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance were
normal
(SVR 1368 dynes-sec/cm5, PVR 52 dynes-sec/cm5). There was no
gradient
upon pullback of the catheter from the LV into the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed (2 samples) from the RV
interventricular septum. RV contraction appeared normal, there
was no
pulmonic outflow obstruction, and prominent trabeculation was
evident.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left heart pressures consistent with
diastolic
dysfunction.
3. Possible restrictive cardiomyopathy.
4. Mildly depressed cardiac index.
5. Successful endomyocardial biopsy.
..
ECHOCARDIOGRAM (2013-11-10 00:00:00):
The atria are moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied and RV cavity is mildly
dilated, with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion or pericardial
thickening. There is no evidence of pericardial constriction.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 34-year old female with a history of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, SVT, hypertension, COPD s/p
multiple PEA arrests who is admitted with CHF exacerbation and
work up for constrictive pericarditis versus restrictive
cardiomyopathy.  She is transferred to the CCU due to runs of
atrial tachycardia to the 160s and associated hypotension.
..
# RHYTHM:  She has a history of multiple SVTs including atrial
fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, MAT and AVNRT.  She was
transferred to the CCU after bursts of what appeared to be MAT.
Due to her hemodynamic compromise in this rhythm, she was
reloaded with amiodorone at a dose of 400 mg UPMCE. She was then
loaded with digoxin and had a subsequent decrease in her
ventricular rate to 70s with 2:1-3:1 atrioventricular
conduction.  Her metoprolol was uptitrated as blood pressure
would tolerate.
.
Plan for AV nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker placement was
delayed by symptomatic candidal UTI being tx with 2 week course.
 However, at time of discharge her rate was well controlled on
the combination of amiodorone, digoxin, and metoprolol. Pt will
return for elective procedure in 1 to 2 weeks after repeat UA is
clear.
..
# PUMP:  She has a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
preserved EF and moderate symmetric LVH.  Right heart
catheterization at UPMCE Hospital prior to transfer showed
equalization of pressures concerning for constrictive
pericarditis.  However, right and left heart catheterization at
UPMCE showed prominent x and y descents and concordance of left
and right ventricular pressures with respiration, all consistent
with a restrictive cardiomyopathy.  Endomyocardial biopsy was
performed and pathology was consistent with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.  Cardiac MR was done with full report above.
.
On physical exam and chest x-ray, it was clear that she was
volume-overloaded and her symptoms of shortness of breath,
fatigue were consistent with her usual heart failure
exacerbations.  She was therefore started on a Lasix drip with
goal diuresis 1 to 1.5 L per day.  At time of discharge, her net
diuresis is negative.  Her oxygen requirements are 2L.
.
# CAD:  There was no evidence of coronary disease on cardiac
catheterization during this or 123 Any St.us hospitalizations.  Blood
pressure and heart rate control were achieved with metoprolol,
amio, and digoxin for primary prevention.
.
# URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  During the hospital course, she
started complaining of burning with urination.  A urine culture
grew out yeast, 100,000 colonies, and because she was
symptomatic we decided to treat with a 14 day course of
fluconazole.  A renal ultrasound was performed to look for
perinephric abscess; this showed no hydronephrosis or
perinephric abcess, it did show a small left pleural effusion.
Her symptoms resolved on fluconazole and is to have a repeat Ua
in 2013-11-10 00:00:00 weeks. Patient can have ablation once UTI resolves.
.
# COPD: We continued her outpatient regimen of Xopenex,
Montelukast, and ipratropium.
.
# DEPRESSION / ANXIETY:  We continued her outpatient regimen of
bupropion, clonazepam, sertraline.
.
She was maintained on a heparin drip due to her underlying
atrial dysrrhythmia; this was switched to lovenox instead of
coumadin at time of discharge because there was concern fo
interactions with digoxin and amiodarone.  She had a cardiac
heart-healthy diet.  There was no indication for GI prophylaxis.

Discharge Instructions:
You had an episode of congestive heart failure with high
pressures within your heart at UPMCE Hospital. We increased
the amount of fluid medicine (spironolactone) to take with the
Furosemide. We also started you on Digoxin and increased your
Metoprolol to control your heart rate. You have a urinary tract
infection and we started you on fluconazole for a total of 14
days. You will need an AV node ablation and pacemaker after your
urinary tract infection is cleared.
Stop taking your warfarin for now, you will give yourself
Lovenox twice daily until the nurse who arranges the pacemaker
tells you to stop taking it.
We started Lisinopril to control your blood pressure better and
help your heart pump. We also started Spiriva to help with your
breathing.
