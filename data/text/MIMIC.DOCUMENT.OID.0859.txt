2012-09-28 00:00:00: CT abd/pelvis showed
1. Significant free air within the abdomen.
2. Gangrenous-appearing gallbladder with large internal stone
and intraluminal gas, with erosive encroachment of the
neighboring Abdulah Flynn, which would provide a mechanism for the
pneumoperitoneum.

Brief Hospital Course:
On 2012-09-28 00:00:00, the patient was admitted to the trauma surgical ICU
on the general surgery service in critical condition with
perforated gangrenous cholecystitis as demonstrated on CT.  He
was hemodynamically unstable, requiring two pressors and
intubation.  Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole were
started.  His family was contactAbdulah Flynn and fully informed, and they
expressed their full undertstanding of the risks of attempting
surgical intervention.  The family was also informed of the high
mortality rate from the patient's illness.  Subsequently, the
family (through the patient's son and health care proxy, Abdulah Flynn
Abdulah Flynn) elected not to pursue any surgical options for care, but
prior discussions with the patient himself included a wish to be
full code.

Social work was consulted, and after the family arrived on the
night of admission, the risks and low benefits of resuscitation
were discussed.  Antibiotics were switched to linezolid and
zosyn.  On 2012-09-28 00:00:00, the family decided to render the patient
DNR and "do not reintubate" status considering the high
morbidity and mortality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the
high risks of surgical intervention.  They wished to maintain
the same level of medical intervention, and the patient
continued to receive copious IVF, with occasional blood
transfusion.  A third pressor was added.  However, in the
evening of 2012-09-28 00:00:00, the patient became asystolic and expired.
