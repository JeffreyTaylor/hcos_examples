prostate, and markedly distended bladder with associated
hydroureter and hydronephrosis. His Foley was advanced with
release of 1200 cc of urine. He received 3 L NS and

Imaging
- CT Abdomen: Malpositioned Foley catheter, likely lying within
the prostatic urethra, with the balloon possibly within the
penile urethra. Associated marked distension of the bladder, and
new mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis and hydroureters
bilaterally. Parenchymal opacity within the left lower lobe in
the lung, could reflect atelectasis. However, superimposed
consolidation cannot be excluded. Cholelithiasis without
secondary findings for cholecystitis. Diverticulosis.
- CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 yom admitted with septic shock and GNR bacteremia, h/o
AS s/p AVR, A.flutter with variable block, chronic urine
retention (dynamic analysis showed bladder atony) w/ chronic
foley.
.
# Septic shock: Patient was treated with IVF, levophed (from
2011-12-03 00:00:00 to 2230 on 2011-12-03 00:00:00.), and empiric vanc/zosyn given a history
of MDR pathogens. Blood cultures 10/29 grew 2 species of GNR,
vancomycin discontinued. Urine was believed to be likely source
given chronic indwelling foley and past urine Cx's. Other
sources discussed included GI, hepatobilliary, peri-rectal.
Prostate exam was unremarkable, demonstrating no tenderness and
there was no evidence of colitis or hepatobilliary disease on CT
scan and no evidence of abscess on rectal. Of note, UCx drawn at
the time was contaminated with "fecal flora," so 1:1 correlation
cannot be established as source. On 2011-12-03 00:00:00 antibiotics were
switched to Meropenem and Ciprofloxacin for double
anti-pseudomonal coverage. Antibiotics were then narrowed to
Meropenem only on 2011-12-03 00:00:00 after sensitivities returned. Speciation
of ED blood Cx + for E.Coli and K.Pneumo x 2 sets with
sensitivities K.Pneumo (pan-sensitive) and E.Coli (sensitive to
only genatmicin and meropenem). Patient remained afebrile on
floor and his clinical picture drastically improved.  He was
alert and oriented x 3 and was able to participate in regular
physical therapy sessions.
.
# UTI: chronic retention at baseline req. indewelling foley with
past urine Cx's showing same MDR E.Coli as current blood Cx.
There was initial concern for prostatitis in setting of
malpositioned foley catheter; however, rectal exam was
unremarkable. Patient was continued on Meropenem as discussed
above.  He was referred to urology for further evaluation.  Of
note, patient may benefit from a urinary diversion (ex:
appendicovescular shunt) to eliminate the issue of chronic
indwelling foley. This may improve his quality of life,
preventing recurrent UTI's and helping with ambulation.
.
# Anemia: HCT at admission 34.5 trended down to nidus of 25.4
now 29.4 without intervention. Baseline in high 20's based on
OMR and normal MCV. Believe large component may have been
dilutional 2011-12-03 00:00:00 over resucitation, now resolving. With normal
MCV, chronic blood loss seems less likely. RDW slightly elevated
suggesting RBC production. Smear was not typical of any single
process.  Patient had known diagnosis of Fe deficiency anemia
and this is likely mixed with anemia of chronic disease. Stools
were guiac'd and negative. His HCT remained stable.
.
# A. Flutter: patient initially presented with AFlutter with RVR
and variable block. Patient with A.Flutter at baseline and may
have had component of demand ischemia at initial presentation
2011-12-03 00:00:00 RVR and hypotension, TN's slightly elevated at admission but
stable. Patient was monitored for several days on telemtry and
was stable.  Rate was well controlled without nodal agents.
Patient was maintained on daily aspirin.
.
# Dementia: patient reports feeling confused while in hospital
but remains A + O x 3. Component likely 2011-12-03 00:00:00 to illness, hospital
stay. Objectively, patient was quite lucid inspite of his
subjective complaints. Patient was maintained on his home
donepezil dose. Nightly vitals were discontinued, visual cues
were increased and SCD's were discontinued to help with possible
delerium.
.
# Access: R. IJ was initialy placed in setting of septic shock
for pressor requirement. R. IJ was dc'd after PICC line placed
to complete 2 week course of IV antibiotics.
.
# Orthostasis: Patient was continued on home dose of
fludrocortisone.
.
# Diarrhea: Patient intially presented with c/o diarrhea x 1
week.  While on the medicine floor, patient's stools remained
unremarkable. On the day prior to discharge, stool frequency
increased and sample was sent for C.Diff toxin and culture. At
the time of discharge C.Diff was neg. x 1.
.
# Dispo: patient was discharge to UPMCE Rehab MACU for further
management.  Follow up appoint to urology was made.  PCP was
Kalman Tasch and agreed to contact patient's daughter with
appointment details.
