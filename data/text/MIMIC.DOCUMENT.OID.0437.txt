2005-11-24 00:00:00 CT Abdomen: no fluid collections. b/l renal cysts, gb
distention,
wall thickening and stones are unchanged with pneumobilia seen,
likely secondary to instrumentation

2005-11-24 00:00:00 TTE  (post op due to new onset a fib): There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with normal left ventricular
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved UPMCE-ventricular systolic function. Mild
aortic insufficiency.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 ECG: Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Consider left
ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
123 Any St.us tracing of 2005-11-24 00:00:00 atrial fibrillation is new.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 ECG: Sinus bradycardia. P-R interval prolongation. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the
123 Any St.us tracing sinus bradycardia is new.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 CXR: Stable chest findings, bilateral basal atelectasis
and mild
blunting of pleural sinuses.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 ECG:Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Left axis deviation. Poor R wave progression. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with lateral ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2005-11-24 00:00:00 rapid atrial
fibrillation is new. Lateral ST-T wave abnormalities are new.
Poor R wave progression is new.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Left axis
deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. There is an abnormal
transition across the precordium most likely due to lead
placement with additional evidence of possible prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
associated ST-T wave changes, although ischemia or myocardial
infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing
atrial fibrillation is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD1 POD0: Patient admitted to surgery, Dr. Bryniah Sprissler. He
was made NPO and given IVF. He was taken to the OR for a
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His surgery was relatively
uncomplicated with minimal blood loss, however the patient
developed afib with RVR to 180 after extubation. He was
initially given lopressor which improved his HR, and then was
started on a dilt drip as per the primary team. He was also
started on a nitro drip for HTN with good control over his BP.
He has hx of MI and CAD s/p stents in 2005-11-24 00:00:00 and is admitted to
the TSICU for ROMI and stabilization. He denied chest pain,
nausea, or SOB at that time.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD2 POD1: A cariology consult was obtained. They stated
that the atrial fibrillation likely secodnary to operative
course and has now resolved. Pt has not had any recurrances of
atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter since being on telemetry.
Cardiac enzymes were negative and pt did not have any chest
pain.
Repeated short runs of SVT are likely the palpitatiosn the pt
has been having for years. It appears to be a short RP
tachycardia and possible etiologies include atrial tachycardia,
AVNRT, or circus movement tachycardia. These are not dangeours
arrhythmias and the pt has likely been having it for years as
his symptoms suggest. Cardiology recommended no anticoagulation
needed. Pt should be sent home with his beta blocker and his
Bryniah Sprissler of hearts monitor.  They continued to follow throughout the
hospital course. The patient was tranferred from the ICU to the
floor.  He was placed on telemetry.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD3 POD2: 12 lead ECG's performed UPMCE. Patient was
given a clear liquid diet.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD4 POD3: Patient's diet was advanced to regular kosher
diet, which the patient tolerated well.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD5 POD4: Patient was placed on a full bowel regiment.
A holter monited was placed on the patient per cardiology
recommendations. Lopressor, IV was used for rate control.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD6 POD5: Patient had a small bowel movement with the
bowel regiment in place. Potassium was repleted. Labs were
monitored daily.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD7 POD6: A 12 lead ECG was performed due to some
ectopy seen on telemetry. The patient had a large bowel
movement. Spoke to electrophysiology fellow who stated that
despite the ectopy, the patient may go home with the Bryniah Sprissler of
hearts monitor.

2005-11-24 00:00:00 HD8 POD7: The Bryniah Sprissler of hearts monitor was placed on the
patient and he was given adequate instructions on its use as
well as relevant follow up.  The metoprolol controlled the
patients heart rate and he did not have any episodes of atrial
fibrillation since POD 1. Patient was discharged to home.

Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged on medications to treat the pain from
your operation. These medications will make you drowsy and
impair your ability to drive a motor vehicle or operate
machinery safely. You MUST refrain from such activities while
taking these medications.  These medications include but are not
limited to: narcotics and benzodiazepines.  Use extreme caution
when combining these substances with each other, alcohol, or
other central nervous system depressants.

For your atrial fibrillation events, you have been fitted with a
Bryniah Sprissler will be
following you for this.

For post-operative pain, please take Tylenol (Acetaminophen) as
prescribed. Note that Acetaminophen is also in many
over-the-counter medications, so check labels -- do not exceed a
daily dose of 4 grams (4,000 mgs) of Acetaminophen.

For pain that breaks thru despite Tylenol, as discussed you
should take Dilaudid as prescribed.

Take all medications as directed.

 Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you
have any of the following:

 * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or
 tightness.

* New or worsening cough or wheezing.

* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your
 medications.

* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting,
 diarrhea or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry
 mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.

* You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a
 bowel movement.


* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 101.5 (F)
 degrees or 38(C) degrees.

* Any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that
 concern you.

* Please resume all regular home medications and take any new
meds
 as ordered.

Activity:

remaining strips 7-10 days after surgery.
Please call the doctor if you have increased pain, swelling,
redness, or drainage from the incision sites.


Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr. Bryniah Sprissler in 2005-11-24 00:00:00 weeks. Call for an
appointment at (test@mail.com.

Please also follow up with Dr. Bryniah Sprissler from the
