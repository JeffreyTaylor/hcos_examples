History of Present Illness:
86 y/o male with a hx of 3V CAD, CHF - EF 35%, chronic afib,
DM2, PVD s/p bypass L [**Doctor Last Name **]-->DP in 2013-09-22 00:00:00, recent dx of colon CA
s/p R colectomy on 2013-09-22 00:00:00 at UPMCE with post-op complications
including confusion, MS changes that resolved with time. Patient
was sent to rehab post-op where he had a fall on L leg, with ?
trauma to L leg. Pt was noticed to have a cold L foot, and he
was transferred to UPMCE for continued evaluation on 2013-09-22 00:00:00.
Pt had angiography on HD 1 which showed 1. Total occlusion of
the left SFA, Total occlusion of the left SFA to DP graft, 3.
Successful stenting of the left SFA, 4. Failed intervention on
the SFA to DP graft, 5. Successful Angioseal. Pt with successful
stent placement, and post-procedure, pt had warm foot to
palpation. On HD3, per notes, patient was noted to be
"pleasantly confused, not oriented to place" with low UOP that
responded to fluid boluses. Pt was also noted to be in mild CHF,
with 2+ edema noted. Over the next 2 days, pt with decreased
a123 Any St.e, poor PO intake, and continued confusion, with
decreased spontaneous movement, requiring restraints to prevent
removal of Foley.
On HD 6, gerontology was consulted for delirium, noting cause
likely multifactorial from environment, stress post-procedure,
and med effect. Recommended zyprexa prn, trazadone 25mg qhs,

4. Failed intervention on the SFA to DP graft.

ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U: IMPRESSION: Patent bypass graft left
lower extremity. The increased velocity in the native vessel
distal to the graft could indicate some arterial disease in the
native vessel.

Noncontrast head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and left parietal
infarct.

EKG: 2013-09-22 00:00:00
Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot rule out myocardial
ischemia. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. No 123 Any St.us.

CXR 2013-09-22 00:00:00
1. Slight improvement in patchy bibasilar opacities, which could
be due to improving atelectasis or aspiration. Underlying
infectious pneumonia not fully excluded in the appropriate
clinical setting.
2. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right

confusion, waxing MS.
1. Mental status change:
Patient with decreased memory with intact attentiveness. His
orientation waxed and waned throughout the day since he was
transfered to the medicine team. Aparently patient had a post op
delerium since his colon resection. It was felt that there was

controlled during hospital stay.

Patient had angioplasty/stent to SFA during hospitalization.
Favorable course. Patient was folled by the vascular surgery
team during his stay on medicine team. NO complications. Good
pulses and Rissman was warm. Patient was continued on plavix and
aspirin

5. DM2 - Patient was controlled with insulin sliding scale
during hospital stay

6. ID
Patient had a U/A with WBCs, mod bacteria on urine, but negative
