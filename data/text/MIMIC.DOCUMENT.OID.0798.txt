Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac catheterization after stenting  demonstrated triple
vessel disease with an EF by echocardiogram of 45%.  He was
prepared for surgery.

On 2009-05-03 00:00:00 he was taken to the Operating Room where
revascularization was performed.  See operative note for
details.  He weaned from bypass on Propofol  infusions.  He
awoke, was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  He
remained stable. CTs were removed according to protocol.  He was
transferred to the floor being atrially paced with a slow sinus
underlying.  He developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was
treated with Amiodaone and lopressor with conversion to sinus
bradycardia in the 50s.  Amiodarone was stopped and the
Lopressor dose dropped.

He remained in sinus for 48 hours and felt well. He was
preparing to go home on POD 4 when he developed atrial
fibrillation again with a ventricular rate of 120s.  He
tolerated this well and Amiodarone was begun. He quickly
converted to sinus rhythm and Coumadin was begun.  Arrangements
were made for his primary carer physician to regulate this with
as target INR of 2009-05-03 00:00:00.5.  Amiodarone was prescribed for 4 weeks
and it will be discontinued, along with the Coumadin, at that
time if sinus rhythm persists.
 Physical Therapy worked with him for strength and mobility
prior to discharge. The lasix was stopped when his BUN elevated
to 38 but fell to 28 the next day. Even though his weight was
slightly above preop he had minimal edema and was doing well.
Follow up, medications and precautions were discussed with the
patient before discharge.
