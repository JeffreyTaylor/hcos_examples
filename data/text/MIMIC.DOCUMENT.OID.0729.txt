Admission Date:  2011-12-24 00:00:00     Discharge Date:  2011-12-24 00:00:00


Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension times one day.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old
African-American female admitted in 2011-12-24 00:00:00 after v-fib arrest.
The patient was defibrillated in the field which was
complicated by anoxic encephalopathy and the patient has
remained vent dependent with PEG at JMR since.  The patient
had a large occiput decub debrided on day prior to admission
and was subsequently noted to have persistent hypotension
with IVF at 75 cc per hour and atrial fibrillation at a rate
greater than 100.  Today labs returned showing white blood
cell count of 50, hematocrit 17, platelets 42 with a systolic
blood pressure in the 80s.  Temperature was 98.4, heart rate
76, respiratory rate 19.  The patient was started on dopamine
and was not given vanc/ceftaz 1 gm which had been ordered,
but not given.  The patient was transferred to UPMCE for
further management.  In the emergency room blood pressure was
99/49, heart rate 142, temperature 100.6 rectally.  The
patient's blood pressure then dropped to 40/palp and heart
rate was 130.  EKG at that time showed a-fib with rapid
ventricular rate.  The patient was cardioverted into a slower
rate, but still with a-fib.  The patient's blood pressure
returned to 120/60.  The patient was started on
Neo-Synephrine in the emergency room as well.  There were
several central line attempts made in the left subclavian,
right groin, then left groin with success.  The patient was
given 2 liters of normal saline and then transferred to the
MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for v-fib arrest
complicated by anoxic encephalopathy and vent dependent since
2011-12-24 00:00:00.  Seizures status post status epilepticus in the past.
Anemia.  A-fib with CHF.  Status post PEG.  Chronic renal
insufficiency.  GI bleed/gastric AVM.  Severe PHTN.
Thrombocytopenia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.day,
Neurontin 600 mg t.i.d., Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
omeprazole 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
multivitamin, Tylenol, Darvocet, Klonopin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient 123 Any St.usly lived with family.
Now the patient is vent dependent at JMR.  No tobacco in the
past.  Social ETOH.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was an obese,
African-American female, trached, unresponsive, in
decerebrate positioning, in no apparent respiratory distress.
Vital signs were temperature 98.4, heart rate 70, blood
pressure 115/40.  Vent setting AC tidal volume 600,
respiratory rate 15, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%.  The patient was
sating 100%.  HEENT: 4 to 5 cm occiput decub to skull about
8 mm deep.  Pupils nonreactive, left about 5 mm, right
approximately 3 mm, fixed.  Anicteric.  Positive pallor.
Neck trached, no lymphadenopathy, JVP not seen secondary to
habitus.  Difficult range of motion, but not meningitic.
Chest symmetrical, good air exchange and minimal expiratory
wheezes bilaterally.  CV irregularly irregular heart rate,
normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:
decreased bowel sounds, moderately distended with
reproducible umbilical hernia.  OB positive.  Extremities had
no clubbing cyanosis, positive 2 to 3+ edema, no splinter
hemorrhages.  Sacral decub to muscle.  Neuro comatose,
decerebrate, positive corneal reflex/gag, decreased tone in
lower extremities, upgoing toe on right, equivocal on left.
No biceps or patellar deep tendon reflexes elicited.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 58, hematocrit 20,
platelets 47, MCV 107.  Chest x-ray within normal limits.
KUB no pneumoperitoneum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's hypotension was treated with
Levophed which had been changed from Neo-Synephrine.  The
patient also had head CT and was started on ceftriaxone and
vancomycin.  The patient was also started on Cipro.  Multiple
blood cultures, urine cultures and fecal cultures were taken.
Swabs of the occipital decub and sacral decub were taken.
Head CT was negative for any acute intracranial process.
There was new pansinusitis.  There was evidence of a
decubitus ulcer to bony calvarium.  There was cerebral
atrophy.  There was old right frontal lucency which may be
chronic epidural hematoma.  Neurology was consulted who
commented on the patient's prognosis.  They concluded that
her exam currently was consistent with only minimal brain
function and that she had lost most of her brainstem function
also.  The patient had an EEG done that showed no seizure
activity.  The patient was noted to have facial twitching
which was felt to be myoclonus which is not uncommon after
anoxic brain injury.

Although the patient did not meet criteria for brain death,
her prognosis was very poor and there was very little chance
of significant functional recovery, given the severity of her
injury and the long period of time for recovery that she had
already declared herself.  A family meeting was set up with
Dr. Boozer who the MICU team had consulted from the ethics
committee.  The patient had six sons and daughters, five of
whom were present during this meeting.  It was agreed during
this meeting to make the patient DNR/DNI and that she would
not want to be continued to be sustained through life support
if there was no chance of meaningful recovery.  It was
decided at the end of the meeting that the missing sibling
would be contactArlondo Boozer and if she was in agreement with the rest
of the siblings, the patient would be made CMO.

After several days, all siblings agreed to make the patient
CMO.  On 2011-12-24 00:00:00 at approximately 10:00 p.m. Levophed was
discontinued.  Morphine drip was started.  The patient was
taken off the ventilator and put on a trach collar.  The
patient expired at approximately 2:55 a.m. on 2011-12-24 00:00:00.
There were no heart sounds on exam.  There were no
spontaneous respirations.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.
The patient's family was present and refused autopsy at this
time.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Pulmonary arrest.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.
