Service:  UPMCE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year-old
female with a past medical history asthma, questionable
congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease presents
with cough, chills, anorexia and back pain times one week.
The patient comes to UPMCE
Emergency Department from primary care physician's office
where she was found to be hypoxic on room air to a saturation
of about 90%.  The patient complained of positive yellow to
white sputum times ten days, diffuse back pain, right chest
pain that radiates to under her right arm, decreased po
intake times one week, chills and sweats.  The patient denies
nausea, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, diarrhea, shortness
of breath, palpitations, headache and abdominal pain.  The
patient was diagnosed with pneumonia at an outside hospital
and given Levaquin.  The patient's primary care physician Annajoy Pilibosian.
Orlowski.  History is limited due to the patient's family not
being around and the patient being an okay historian.  The
patient has had positive sick contacts within her family
recently.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 16.7, hematocrit 37.8,
platelets 352, sodium 138, K 4.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate
16, BUN 41, creatinine 2.1 changing to 2.3.  Glucose 61,
anion gap of 19.  CPK 33, MB not done and troponin T less
then .01. Chest x-ray showed right middle lobe and left lower
lobe pneumonia (chest x-ray from outside facility read by in
house radiologist).

In the Emergency Room the patient was given Azithromycin 500
mg, Levofloxacin 500 mg and 1 liter of normal saline.  Blood
cultures were drawn times one.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pneumonia:  The patient initially given
Levofloxacin and Azithromycin in the Emergency Department.
This was changed to Levofloxacin and Vancomycin when blood
cultures showed gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
One set of blood cultures came back positive in both
anaerobic and aerobic bottles for strep pneumococcus and
therefore Ceftriaxone was added on for double coverage and
Flagyl added on for questionable aspiration pneumonia.  Strep
pneumo was sensitive to Levofloxacin.  On 2006-10-22 00:00:00 the
patient required an increase in oxygen need from 3 liters to
nasal cannula to 5 liters of nasal cannula to keep
saturations in the 90s.  An arterial blood gas on that day
was right fem stick showed 7.37, 29, 61 on 5 liters nasal
cannula.  Lactate at that time was normal.  The patient
received a CT scan that showed moderate right pleural
effusion and right sided pneumonia.  Interventional pulmonary
was called to assist in a thoracentesis, however, by
ultrasound minimal fluid was seen and no thoracentesis was
performed.  On 2006-10-22 00:00:00 the patient had increased oxygen
requirement and needed to be on 10 liters face mask to keep
her oxygen saturation in the 90s.  She desated to the 80s
when she was off the face mask.  Legionella antigen was
negative.  The patient continued on triple antibiotic,
however, oxygen need continued to increase.  Overnight on
2006-10-22 00:00:00 the patient desated to the 70s and needed to be on 10
liters of nonrebreathers to get her oxygen saturations in the
90s.  On the morning of 2006-10-22 00:00:00 the patient is much more
somnolent then baseline and an arterial blood gas was
obtained from the right femoral artery and it was 7.27, 46,
131 on 10 liters nonrebreather.  Lactate is pending from
that.  MICU consult was called and she is probably going to
be transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

Repeat CT scan with contrast showed no PE, showed diffuse
ground glass opacities in bilateral lung fields with no
change in pneumonia of the right upper lobe, right lower lobe
and right middle lobe.  Patient with probable ARDS given that
her PAO2/FIO2 on day of transfer 2006-10-22 00:00:00 equals 131,
which is less then 200.  Until the patient was transferred to
the MICU respiratory was called to put the patient on a BiPAP
machine.

2.  Elevated INR:  Possibly due to poor po intake and
malnutrition, therefore the patient was given vitamin K
replacement.

3.  Hypothyroidism:  The patient's TSH was 1.1 and her T4 was
found to be low at 0.4 so her Levoxyl dose was increased from
60 to 75.

4.  Asthma:  Patient with occasional wheezes and was started
on nebulizer treatments and maintained on Fluticasone.

5.  Alzheimer's disease:  Fomepizole was continued.  Haldol
prn.

6.  Depression:  Paroxetine continued.

7.  Hypertension:  The patient is not on medication.  Her
blood pressure has been within normal limits.

8.  Questionable congestive heart failure:  Patient with
crackles on examination, however on admission no edema, and
no JVD.  Urinary output was monitored.  On the day of
transfer patient with increase in jugulovenous pulsation,
mild nonpitting edema on examination.  Lasix 20 intravenously
was ordered along with a Foley catheter to monitor
instructions and out.

9.  Increased creatinine/renal failure:  The patient came in
with a high BUN to creatinine ratio.  Creatinine on admission
was 2.3, with intravenous fluids it came down to 1.0.
Appeared to be prerenal acute renal failure.  The patient was
given 1 liter of intravenous fluids the day prior to
transfer, because she was getting contrast for her CT scan.

10.  Arrhythmia:  The patient found to be tachycardic on
2006-10-22 00:00:00 in the 140s.  On electrocardiogram she had no T
waves and appeared to be in possible atrial fibrillation.
The patient's nebulizers were changed to Ipratropium with
Albuterol only for prn.  The patient had recently received
her Albuterol medication prior to her tachycardia.  Lopressor
5 intravenously was pushed and she was started on 12.5 b.i.d.
for rate control.  The patient was maintained on telemetry.
A repeat electrocardiogram was normal.  The patient had an
episode on telemetry that appeared to be nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia and the patient received an
echocardiogram, which showed an elongated left atrium, EF of
50 to 60, moderate dilated ascending aorta, mild thickening
of AV valve that are not stenotic, 1+ aortic regurgitation,
mild thickening of mitral valve, 1 to 2+ mitral
regurgitation, mild thickened tricuspid valve thickening and
fibrotic, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation (no change since prior
study on 2006-10-22 00:00:00).

11.  Leukocytosis:  Patient with right upper, middle and
lower lobe infiltrate and strep pneumococcus bacteremia.
Repeat blood cultures are still pending.  White blood cell
count is still climbing to a value of 24.7 today up from
18.5.

12.  Chest pain on admission:  The patient ruled out for
myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes times three and
maintained on aspirin.

13.  Chronic pruritus:  Given antihistamine.

14.  Anemia:  The patient is anemic on admission with a
hematocrit of 38.8 down to a low in the 20s, now on transfer.
Hematocrit is stable at 30.3.  The patient with guaiac
positive stools.

15.  Diarrhea:  Patient with a few episodes of diarrhea.
C-diff culture negative.

16.  FEN:  Patient found to have low albumin levels 1.9,
total protein 4.7.  Given probable ARDS status hypercatabolic
and may account for low albumin and edema.  Boost
supplementation was added and a nutrition consult was called.
A nutrition consult has not come prior to transfer.

STATUS ON TRANSFER:  Poor.  The patient is sating in the 90s
on 10 liters nonrebreather, appears more somnolent then
normal.  She is being transferred to the MICU.
