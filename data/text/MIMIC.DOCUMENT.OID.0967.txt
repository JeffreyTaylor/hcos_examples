Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Laramore is a 53 year old F with long history of mesenteric
ischemia s/p ileocolectomy and SMA bypass who presented with one
week history of worsening abdominal pain and associated
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.

1. Abdominal pain: Ms Laramore was admitted from the ED to the
surgery service for futher evaluation of her abdominal pain. An
initial abdominal CT showed an edematous R colon with an abrupt
transition to normal colon and midtransverse colon. She was
observed with serial exams, given pain control, and evaluated by
vascular surgery. She was initially admitted to the ICU for
close monitoring given risk of bowel ischemia. She was started
on Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric coverage at the advice of
the consulting infectious disease service. She was maintained on
bowel rest until her pain improved. On hospital day 5 she was
successfully transitioned to a regular diet and restarted on her
coumadin prior to her discharge home. Her pain resolved without
invasive intervention.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient is on coumadin chronically for her
multiple bypass grafts. Upon presentation to the hospital, she
was found to be supratherapeutic , with an INR of 4.7. Her
coumadin was held and allowed to float down to an appropriate
therapeutic range. She was restarted on her home doses prior to
discharge and upon resumption of a regular diet.
