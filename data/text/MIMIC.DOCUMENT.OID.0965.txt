Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Antria Consoer
Chief Complaint:
ETOH and medication overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Respiratory Intubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with PMH of alcoholism who
presents after a dangerous combination of alcohol intoxication
and accidental medication overdose. Per report, patient's
partner says he "fell off the wagon" 2-3 days ago after being
sober for years. He drank large quantities of port wine and took
extra medications reportedly "by mistake." The partner is pretty
sure that the patient was intoxicated when he multiple tablets
of wellbutrin, seroquel, propranolol and klonipin but he is
uncertain of specific amount. He later stated that he was not
absolutely certain whether the patient actually ingested any
wellbutrin and propanolol. Ultimately, the amount and
combination of pills taken was unclear. The patient's longtime
partner of nearly thirty years came home and found him
semi-alert and called EMS immediately.
.
According to his partner, Mr. Shaulis had been
coughing/wheezing for several months now but had no complaints
of fevers or chills.  He had been complaining about pain in his
neck since a fall down a few stairs a few days prior to this
current incident.
.
In our ED, initial vital signs were T97.3 BP 90/54 HR 68 RR 12
oxygen saturation of 95% via NRB. He was placed on NRB for low
oxygen saturations <90. He was somnolent on arrival to hospital
but still responsive to tactile stimuli.  Fingerstick glucose
was 140 on arrival. He quickly became hypotensive to SBP 73/47.
He was given IVF x3L total. EKG was normal, without any alarming
ST changes. Peripheral dopamine was started for rapid BP
correction and he was intubated for hypoxia and airway
protection. Toxicology consult was called and they recommended
that the pressor choice be switched to Levofed. He was also
given narcan x2 with no effect. Once the medication history was
flushed out, he was given calcium which did increase his rate
from 58 to 88 and his SBP increased by 10. He was given glucagon
1mg with no further effect. Toxicology consult recommended
trying high dose glucagon 5mg and if that works, starting a
glucagon gtt at 1-5mg/hr. They also recommend serial EKGs for
monitoring.  He was also given Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone due to
initial concern for possible sepsis.
.
He had chest xray which showed question widened mediastinum and
patient reported some chest discomfort on arrival. CTA was done
which showed normal aorta. FAST scan was done which showed no
pericardial effusion, and no intra-abdominal bleeds.  CXR/CT did
show bilateral infiltrates consistent with an aspiration.
Hemodynamic instability was worrisome and he was transferred to
the intensive care unit for close monitoring.
.
On arrival to the ICU he was hypoxic with O2 saturation of 85%
on FIO2 of 50%, HR in 50's.  He was suctioned, ET tube pulled
back 2cm and PEEP increased to 14, FIO2 to 100% with slow
recovery of O2 saturation. He was continued on Levophed and an
arterial line was placed for better hemodynamic monitoring.
.


Past Medical History:
Alcoholism
Hypertension
Depression

Social History:
The patient lives in 123 Any St. with his partner of over 30 years.
He has local family but has limited contact with them.  He
reports that he and his partner do not work because they have
enough money to allow them not to need to work.
Mr. Shaulis reports drinking only one glass of wine a day,
yet also endorses drinking enough prior to admission that he got
confused when taking his medications. Thus, history somewhat
questionable. Denies illicit drug use. He reports having been
sober for a stretch of 14-15 years in the past (w/ help of
rehab, AA), but started drinking again about 13 years ago in the
context of a few deaths in the family.  Per his partner, his
drinking has been much more heavy in recent months.

Family History:
Noncontributory.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. Shaulis is a 55-year old male with PMH of
alcoholism and depression who presented with somnolence,
bradycardia and hypotension after ETOH intoxication and
"accidental" ingestion of multiple medications.
He endured some initial hypoxia secondary to severe sedation and
in the setting of an aspiration event as noted via imaging
studies. Additional issues outlined in detail below.
.
#Hypoxia/SOB: - The patient presented to the ED emergently on
2012-10-12 00:00:00 with oversedation, hypoxia and systolic blood pressures
that dropped to the 70s requiring emergency pressor therapy. He
was placed on a high flow non-rebreather mask initially and then
needed to be intubated with immediate admit to MICU for his
hemodynamic instability and hypoxia. Bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates were noted on CXR/CT which were felt to be secondary
to aspiration pneumonitis vs aspiration PNA. Mucous plug was
also in the possible differential but there were very minimal
secretions on suctioning attempts. He was given Levofloxacin
initially and cultures were sent off. ABG just prior to MICU
admission was pH 7.14, PO2 64, pCO2 59, Bicarb 21. Upon transfer
to the regular medical floor the patient was doing well with
oxygen saturations 94-95% on 2L NC and RR ranging in the low
20s. Blood cultures were negative to date but broncheoalveolar
lavage showed coagulase positive staphylococcus/MSSA. Ammonia
level was within normal limits , LFTs were improving and there
was no real concern for hepatic encephalopathy anymore. On the
medical floor he was initially continued on IV Unasyn and then
gradually switched over to PO Augmentin as discharge approached.
He was continued on 2L NC with oxygen saturation goal >95% which
he achieved without difficulty and he was gradually weaned to
room air. His initial dry cough on transfer improved as well.
Repeat CXRs showed improvement in pulmonary edema but very
persisent multifocal pneumonia was questioned so he was
continued on antibiotics. An ECHO showed no evidence of any
serious valve abnormalities or vegetations and overall EF was
55%. By time of discharge he was breathing 97% room air and his
cough had nearly abated.
.

# Hypertension/Tachycardia/Agitation: After a few days in the
MICU the patient had bouts of hypertension with SBPs >170s,
sweats, fevers, and tachycardia to 120-130s range. These changes
were likely due to ETOH withdrawal in conjunction with
benzodiazepine withdrawal and possibly related to other toxic
ingestions. These dynamic changes made weaning the patient from
the vent especially challenging in the MICU. He became extremely
agitated when sedating medications were tapered and was unable
to be extubated successfully for several days. Moreover, he
appeared to have delirium from multiple medications which were
still wearing off. He received a very large amount of
benzodiazepines during the first three days of admission and
these were ultimately discontinued for concern of toxicity.
Psychiatry and the toxicology staff were consulted and he was
switched to standing and PRN Haldol which had a very good
outcome and helped to ease his agitation and stabilize his
tachycardia.
The possibility of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome was considered
as well. Of note, the patient got some Zyprexa for agitation and
he had already ingested a large amount of Seroquel during his
overdose; both of these medications can cause NMS. Ck levels
returned elevated but not quite in the usual range seen in NMS
so this diagnosis was unlikely. It was felt that Mr. Shaulis'
delirium was  multifactorial in the setting of recent hypoxia,
ongoing sedation and polysubstance withdrawal from his
ETOH/Benzodiazepines. A few doses of morphine worked well for
his agitation as well. Psychiatry continued to follow the
patient with the medical service once he transferred to the
medical floor from the MICU. Ammonia panel and  RPR were
unremarkable and soon after transfer the to medical floor he was
managed on lower and lower doses of Ativan and Haldol and he
gradually improved with HRs returning to 60-80 range and blood
pressure normalized. LFTs and CK levels also trended downwards.

.
#Fevers: The patient had high persistent fevers in the 101-102
range in the MICU after admission. He also had hypotension in
the ED but this felt to be directly related to his overdose and
ETOH intoxication versus a sepsis picture. As noted, scattered
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were noted on CXR/CT and were
felt to be the source of his fevers. IV Unasyn was given. Urine
and Blood cultures all returned negative. Urine legionella was
negative. BAL showed coagulase positive staphylococcus on
cultures so antibiotics were continued. Neuroleptic maliganant
syndrome was suspected as well but CK levels trended downward
making this unlikely. There was some moderate hematuria on UA
repeat but this was attributed to witnessed foley manipulation
during his multiple episodes of agitation as opposed to
infection. An LP was considered upon transfer to the medical
floor but fortunately his fevers began to lessen and after 2012-10-12 00:00:00
days he stopped having high spikes. Ultimately, the fevers may
have been a combination of his polysubstance withdrawal in
combination with fevers secondary to aspiration related
pneumonia. He was afebrile and had no left shifts or
leukocytosis at time of discharge.

.
#Altered Mental Status: As aforementioned the patient presented
with hypotension and bradycardia which was attributed to the
combination of propranolol, seroquel and possibly
Prozac/Wellbutrin per the patient's partner. On repeated
questioning the patient admitted that the overdose was an
accident and an unintentional act that occured in the setting of
extreme ETOH intoxication. The patient still appeared very
agitated, diaphoretic and confused on transfer out of MICU.
Initial confusion likely secondary to receiving 500mg Diazepam
over 30hrs for presumed ETOH withdrawal while in MICU. He had
some intermittent autonomic hyperactivity and HTN with SBPs to
160-170s and serious inattention on exam. He also had a slight
tremor in his hands bilaterally which is likely from his
sedative withdrawal. The patient's partner noted that he
sometimes noticed he had a mild tremor at his baseline too.
Psychiatry continued to follow the patient and advised the team
to continue Haldol and Ativan for his agitation. He was started
on Haldol 5mg IV PRN dosing every few hours and  Haldol standing
2.5mg IV q6hrs which was slowly tapered down and he was
gradually weaned down from Ativan 1mg qid to 1mg t.i.d, b.i.d.,
and then qdaily dosing.
He became very belligerent and tried to pull out his IV lines
initially so soft restraints were needed along with a 1:1 sitter
on his first night out of the MICU which was only a day after
being extubated. He recovered quickly and became less confused
and more attentive over the subsequent hospital stay and by the
time of his discharge he was still plagued by some mild
irritability and some amnesia surrounding his overdose and MICU
stay but he was alert and oriented to person, place and time at
time of his discharge. Social work and psychiatry services
offered additional counseling and despite offers to set him up
with specific resources he reported he was planning to make a
conscious effort to try to stop drinking after discharge with
support of AA and professional supports as needed.
.

#Acute Renal Failure -Per records, the patient's baseline
creatinine 1-1.3 and he presented in the ED with an initial Cr
level of 2.2 which was likely in the setting of direct
nephrotoxic influence of the multiple medications he ingested as
well as the renal hypoperfusion that occurred in the setting of
his SBPs dropping to the 70s prompting the need for pressor
support. He also had a pre-renal component which cna be
explained by recent ETOH abuse and tendency for dehydration. Mr.
Shaulis was given IVF resuscitation and throughout his
hospital stay his renal function recovered. By the time of
discharge creatinine was down to 1.1 range and BUN 17.
.
#Hypertension: As outlined above, the patient's blood pressure
was poorly controlled in the MICU with intermittent autonomic
surges of tachycardia and SBP increases to  the 160s-170s. He
was restarted on his daily Propranolol and his blood pressures
returned to 130-140s prior to discharge.
.
#Pancreatitis: While in the MICU, the patient had an acute rise
in his Lipase levels which eventually peaked at  and then
continued to trend downward. The increase was possibly due to
ETOH or Propofol with increased triglycerides. Abdomen somewhat
firm but not tense.  He tolerating tube feeds very well and then
continued on a regular diet on the regular medical floor once he
transferred out of the MICU. On exam he denied any abdominal
pain, no guarding and no rebound noted.
.

#ETOH Abuse ?????? The patient's partner endorses that patient has
been sober for years, and only recently ??????fell off the wagon??????
over the last few months.  The extent of his withdrawal,
however, suggests that his use of alcohol is potentially much
more extensive.  He was continued on daily Thiamine, Folate and
he was seen by psychiatry as well as the addictions consult
social worker. Darthie Shaulis teams counseled him on ETOH's harmful
effects and several means of support were explored with the
patient
Ranitidine was continued for GI protection.
.
#Loose stools -These loose bowel movements were initially noted
on 2012-10-12 00:00:00. Follow-up stool and C.difficile labs were all
unremarkable. By time of discharge his diarrhea had stopped and
he denied any abdominal pain, cramps, or changes in the color of
his stool. No bloody stools.
.
#Anemia - The patient's baseline HCT is ~40 according to recent
records, and he was also noted to be borderline macrocytic
therefore anemia likely secondary to  nutritional deficiency in
the setting of ETOH abuse. No evidence of any GI bleeding.
An order to gaiac stools was placed and daily Hcts were trended.
B12 and folate levels were normal. The patient will plan to
follow up with his primary care physician Antria Consoer ~ 1 week
timeframe to address his anemia in more detail.
.
#Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Tolerating PO medications
well, re123 Any St.g electrolytes as needed, thiamine given daily.
.
# Access ??????The patient had a right PICC that was placed 2012-10-12 00:00:00
for access for TPN and multiple medications as well. This was
eventually pulled and a regular IV was placed.
.
#Prophylaxis: The patient was placed on a bowel regimen,
subcutaneous heparin shots were given daily for DVT prophylaxis
and Ranitidine was continued for GI protection.

The patient was treated as a full code for the entirety of his
hospital course and communication occurred with the patient
daily and with his mother and partner of nearly 30 years. The
psychiatry service felt that Mr. Shaulis was safe to leave
the hospital but he was advised to follow-up with his primary
care physician, 123 Any St.us counselor upon
leaving the hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at UPMCE during your hospitalization.

You were admitted to the hospital after consuming a large amount
of alcohol mixed with multiple medications. This impaired your
breathing and your mental status. You had to stay in the medical
intensive care unit for a week and then you were transferred to
the general medical floor. During your hospital stay you became
very confused and needed additional medications and a breathing
machine called a ventilator to help you breath for about a week.

.
You were also treated with antibiotics for a suspected lung
infection.
.
While you were in the hospital you were seen by a psychiatrist
