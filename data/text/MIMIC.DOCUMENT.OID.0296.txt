Date of Birth: 1985-07-23 00:00:00 00:00:00     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
male with no significant past medical history other than
hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL and tobacco abuse, who presents
with ST elevation myocardial infarction.

The morning of admission he woke up at 6:15 a.m. and felt
unwell with mild upper chest discomfort at rest.  He had no
dyspnea on exertion, nor shortness of breath.  He went to
work, had continued discomfort, and at noon developed frank
upper chest pain with radiation to both arms, mild dyspnea,
though no nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.

He was brought to the UPMCE
where electrocardiogram showed inferior ST segment elevation
and he was transferred emergently to cardiac catheterization.
He was enrolled in the Cool Myocardial infarction Study and
randomized to the cooling arm.

Left heart catheterization showed discrete 100% lesion at the
right coronary artery with timi one flow.  Percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed and 3.5 by 13
millimeter stent was employed following which repeat
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed.
Repeat angiography showed residual stenosis proximal to the
stent.  Therefore, repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty was done and repeat angiography done showed
complete resolution of the lesion.  He also had a 70% lesion
at the second obtuse marginal that was not treated.  Left
ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis and ejection
fraction of 42%, normal aortic and mitral valves.  The right
heart catheterization showed mean right atrial pressure of
16, pulmonary artery pressure of 49/25 and a mean pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 15.  The patient was transiently
bradycardic and Atropine was given with good results.  He was
admitted to the CCU in order to continue the cool myocardial
infarction protocol.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.  In 2006-07-24 00:00:00, total cholesterol
was 238, triglycerides 728, LDL 118 and HDL 29.
2.  Primary care physician is Creelman. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2763**] Creelman, test@mail.com.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former EMT.  He smokes one
half pack per day, approximately thirty pack year history.
No alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father and many in his
father's family have coronary artery disease but no report of
early death.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 34.6
(cooling was in place), heart rate 87, blood pressure 106/56,
respiratory rate 15, oxygen saturation 97%.  In general, he
was alert in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Sclerae anicteric.  The neck is supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  Jugular venous pressure is not visible.
Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular is
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Normal
S1 and S2, no S3, no S4.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Groin sheaths in place,
no hematoma noted, no bruit.  Extremities no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Skin no rashes.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus
rhythm, 2.0 to 3.123 Any St. elevation in leads II, III
and aVF, ST depression in leads V1 and V2, and T wave
inversion in leads V1, V2 and aVL.  This was prior to cardiac
catheterization.

White blood cell count was 9.5, hematocrit 39.4, platelet
count 256,000, differential of white count 69% neutrophils,
27% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes.  Chem7 revealed sodium 147,
potassium 3.9, chloride 109, bicarbonate 19, blood urea
nitrogen 9, creatinine 0.8 and glucose 85.  ALT was 2, AST
17, CK 176, alkaline phosphatase 43, amylase 39, calcium 8.8.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 51 year old male status post inferior
ST elevation myocardial infarction this morning who was
brought immediately to cardiac catheterization where he
received a stent to the right coronary artery.  He also had a
70% stenosis at the OM2 that was intervened upon.  He was
enrolled in the Cool Myocardial Infarction Study and
randomized to the cooling arm so was transferred to the CCU
for the study protocol. Otherwise, he was stable after
catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac - The patient was continued on Aspirin and
Plavix.  Beta blocker therapy was initiated as was ace
inhibitor therapy.  Integrilin was continued for eighteen
hours after cardiac catheterization.  CKs peaked at 648 with
a MB of 54.  Electrocardiographic changes resolved.
Hypercholesterolemia was treated with Lopid.  He will need a
stress test in the future to address clinical significance of
the lesion at the OM2.

With respect to the Cool Myocardial Infarction Protocol, the
patient did well and received Demerol while cooling in order
to treat rigors.

The patient had an echocardiogram on 2006-07-24 00:00:00, that showed an
ejection fraction of 50 to 55%, basal inferior and
midinferior hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall and
normal free wall motion of the right ventricular wall.

2.  Pulmonary - There were no signs or symptoms of congestive
heart failure.

3.  Renal - The patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
were normal throughout the admission.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily for thirty days.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Lopid 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.

FOLLOW-UP:   Follow-up should be with Dr. Khiree Bovio in three
to four weeks, telephone test@mail.com, and with his primary
care physician, Creelman. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2763**] Creelman, telephone number above.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Status post stent to the right coronary artery.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
