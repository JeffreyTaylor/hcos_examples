CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic right ankle infection with unstable
joint.

2 years who underwent a right ankle traction and open
reduction internal fixation. The patient has had multiple
admissions for wound infections and multi123 Any St. antibiotic
courses. Most recent admission was 2006-12-10 00:00:00, for a
wound infection. The patient recently complained of a
temperature elevation on 2006-12-10 00:00:00, and now is to be
admitted to Dr.Eleigh Schrantz service for continued IV
antibiotics. The patient initially was discharged on
daptomycin and followed by VNA.

cadaver transplant in 2006-12-10 00:00:00, history of coronary artery
disease, status post CABG in 2006-12-10 00:00:00, history of peripheral
vascular disease, right ankle fracture in 2006-12-10 00:00:00, with an
open reduction internal fixation, status post hardware
removal, chronic osteomyelitis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, dicloxacillin 100 mg twice a day,
gabapentin 1600 mg twice a day, Lasix 20 mg twice a day,
Sensipar 30 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg daily, ranitidine 150
mg daily. There are two other medications that the patient is
on, of which the handwriting is not decipherable at this
time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker, is married and
lives with his spouse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 94.6, 94, 18, blood
pressure 144/88, oxygen saturation 93% in room air. Blood
sugar fingerstick was 291 on admission. General appearance:
Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress. HEENT
exam: Mild right eye ptosis. Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Chest is with a well healed median
sternotomy incision. Heart is a regular rate and rhythm with
a systolic ejection murmur II/VI, nonradiating. Abdomen is
soft, nontender, obese. Extremities: Right malleolus with
punctate lesion with draining and surrounding erythema. Pulse
exam shows palpable radial pulses, femoral pulses
bilaterally. The right DP and PT are dopplerable signals. The
left DP and PT are dopplerable signs. Neurological exam is
nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. His dicloxacillin was continued. Vancomycin and
Flagyl were instituted. He was continued on his preadmission
medications. He was seen by Dr. Schrantz and advisement was
made for him to undergo a below the knee amputation. The
patient accepted the recommendation. Transplant nephrology
was consulted to follow the patient during his
hospitalization. Schrantz was consulted for hyperglycemic
management. Daily SK5 levels were obtained. He required
minimal adjustment in his immunosuppression. He continued on
his Lantus with a Humalog sliding scale with improvement in
his glycemic control. On 2006-12-10 00:00:00, he underwent a
right BKA without incident. He was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition. At the end of his surgical procedure
intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 60s and he was given Neo 200
mcg x2 and epinephrine 5 mg x2. The patient went into a
monomorphic VT 4 minutes at a rate of 130. He was given
lidocaine 100 mg IV bolus and amiodarone 125 mg over 15
minutes. The patient converted to sinus rhythm. An
intraoperative TEE showed severe biventricular failure.
Dopamine was started at 5 mcg/kg/minute. Blood pressure
improved. He was transferred to the PACU and then to the ICU
for continued care. Serial enzymes were obtained. Repeat echo
was obtained on the 28th which demonstrated left ventricular
wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained by 2-D
images. He has severely depressed left ventricular ejection
fraction. He had multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
His aortic valve was moderately thickened leaflets. There
were no masses or vegetations on the aortic valve. No aortic
insufficiency. The mitral valve, tricuspid valve were normal
with trivial MR Eleigh Schrantz. The pulmonic valve and artery were
unremarkable. The pericardium showed no pleural effusion.
Aortic valve area was calculated at 1.3 cm squared, normal is
3 cm squared. Gradient peak was 32 mm. There was no
intracardiac thrombus noted on the primary or the secondary
echo. The ejection fraction was calculated at 30% to 40%. IV
heparin was begun to maintain a goal PTT between 40 and 60.
The patient's Dobutamine was weaned with hopes to extubate.
Pulse exam remained unchanged. The right amputation site was
clean dry dressing. He remained on bedrest in the SICU.
Cardiac enzymes: Base was 20, peaked at 96 for the CK. CK MBs
were not obtained. His troponins were 0.01 and 0.03. The
patient's Swan was converted to a CVL on 2006-12-10 00:00:00.
The patient continued on heparin, was extubated and
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care on
2006-12-10 00:00:00. Cardiology was requested to see the
patient on 2006-12-10 00:00:00, who felt the patient was
hemodynamically stable and his atrial fibrillation was rate
controlled. We should continue the heparin while his INR is
less than 2 and his goal INR should be 2006-12-10 00:00:00, and recommend
metoprolol tartrate twice a day versus single dosing. They
recommended aspirin 81 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily.
Hyperglycemia control remained relatively good. He did not
require adjustment in his Lantus. His premeal coverage was
adjusted. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were
discontinued on 2006-12-10 00:00:00. The patient remained
afebrile. Foley was discontinued. Peripheral line was placed
and the central line was discontinued. The patient had been
advanced to a regular diet and ambulation to chair was begun.
On 2006-12-10 00:00:00, postoperative day 5, the patient
continues on IV heparin/Coumadinization conversion. Serial
coags were monitored. Physical therapy will see the patient
and make recommendations regarding disposition planning,
being a new amputation if he will go to rehabilitation. Will
talk to infectious disease, Dr. Schrantz, regarding discontinue
the doxycycline. The remaining hospital course, the patient
will be discharged when medically stable and bed available at
rehabilitation. At the time of discharge, discharge
medication instructions will be dictated.
