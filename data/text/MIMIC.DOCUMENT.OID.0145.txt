Date of Birth: 1936-04-12 00:00:00 00:00:00       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old gentleman
who went to see his primary care physician for his yearly
physical.  At that time, he reported a 1-year history of
burning substernal chest pain with exertion.  He underwent an
exercise treadmill test which was positive and subsequently
underwent cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection
fraction of 55%, 90% left main coronary artery, 90% proximal
left anterior descending artery, 60% to 80% left circumflex,
and a proximally occluded right coronary artery.  The patient
was referred to Dr. Verna for urgent coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife and
his two children.  He works in construction.  Positive
tobacco with half a pack per day for 40 years.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to UPMCE and taken to the
operating room on 2012-04-12 00:00:00 with Dr. Verna for a coronary
artery bypass graft times three.  Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery.  The patient had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory
due to his difficult anatomy and that remained during his
surgery.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine infusion.
Postoperatively, the patient requried a moderate amount of
volume resuscitation.

Due to his elevated filling pressures and some minor
postoperative electrocardiogram changes, a transesophageal
echocardiogram was performed at the bedside which showed a
normal ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormalities.
The patient's hemodynamics improved over the next couple of
hours.  On postoperative day one, the patient was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation.  The intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed without difficulty.  The
Neo-Synephrine was weaned to off.

On postoperative day two, the patient was started on
Lopressor which he tolerated well.  On postoperative day
three, the patient's chest tubes were removed without
difficulty as well as his pacing wires.

On postoperative day four, the patient's hematocrit was noted
to be down to 21.  The patient was not symptomatic and had
stable vital signs.  It was discussed with Dr. Verna, and a
transfusion was deferred.

On postoperative day five, the patient continued to ambulate
with Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day six, the patient's hematocrit was noted
to be down to 20.8.  The decision was made to transfuse the
patient; however, the patient refused a blood transfusion.
The risks of refusing a transfusion were discussed with him.
As the patient remained hemodynamically stable, with no
evidence of orthostasis, a stable blood pressure, and stable
oxygen saturation, the blood transfusion was deferred.  The
patient had been started on iron and vitamin C.

On postoperative day seven, the patient worked with Physical
Therapy and was able to walk 500 feet and climb one flight of
stairs.  The patient's hematocrit had risen to 21.1, and it
was felt the patient was appropriate for discharge to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum was 99.2, pulse
was 82 (in sinus rhythm), blood pressure was 119/66,
respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation 96% on room
air.  Laboratory data red white blood cell count was 9.2,
hematocrit was 21.1, and platelet count was 330.  Potassium
was 4, blood urea nitrogen was 27, and creatinine was 1.
Neurologically, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented
times three.  Heart regular in rate and rhythm without
murmurs.  Breath sounds were clear bilaterally.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Tolerating a regular diet.  The sternal incision was
clean, dry, and intact.  The sternum was stable.  Lower
extremities revealed 1 to 2+ pitting edema.  Vein harvest
site was clean, dry, and intact.  There was no erythema or
drainage.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
3.  Postoperative anemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Lopressor 75 mg by mouth twice per day.
 2.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice per day (times seven days).
 3.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq by mouth twice per day (times
seven days).
 4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
 5.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
 6.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth every day.
 7.  Lipitor 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 8.  Niferex 150 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Vitamin C 500 mg by mouth twice per day.
10.  Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth q.6h. as needed.
11.  Dilaudid 2 mg to 6 mg by mouth q.6h. as needed.
12.  Multivitamin one tablet by mouth once per day.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient to be discharged to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. Verna in one to
two weeks.
2.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. Kauri Ratton Verna in
three to four weeks.
