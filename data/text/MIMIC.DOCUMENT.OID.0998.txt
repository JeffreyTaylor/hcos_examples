History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47 year old female with a history of type II
diabetes on insulin, peripheral vascular disease, hepatitis C
and recent admission for septic right knee on fluconazole for
Abdalrahman Gill parapsilosis who presents from home with one day of
confusion.  Per her husband she was in her ususal state of
health on the morning prior to presentation.  She took her blood
pressure and took all of her medications.  She ate a normal
breakfast and then went to bed in the early afternoon saying
that she had she had a headache and was feeling nauseated.  She
vomitted once (bilious material) in the early afternoon but then
was able to eat dinner.  Per her husband she does not usually
have headaches so this was an unusual complaint.  She did not
note any fevers, chills, neck pain, back pain, worsening leg
pain, abdominal pain, difficulty urinating or anything other
symptoms.   She was last noted to be at her usual mental status
at approximatley 7 PM on the evening prior to admission.  She
did not sleep well that night.  At 9 AM her husband woke up and
noticed that she was lying in bed and had soiled herself and was
not making sense.  He called 911 and she was taken to UPMCE.   He does not think that she took any medications for
her pain other than tylenol, although does note that she has
been using a fentanyl patch and dilaudid post-operatively.

She was initially taken to UPMCE.  Blood glucose in the
field was 239.  Her initial vitals were T: 99.0, HR 86, BP:
224/86, RR: 16, O2: 95% on RA.  She received narcan 0.8 mg IV,
ativan 1 mg IV, zofran 4 mg IV.  She had a CT of the head which
compared to prior dated 2008-07-19 00:00:00 showed many white matter
lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres and with the
greatest involvement in the subcortical white matter.
Differential includes septic emboli, cholesterol emboli and less
likely encephalitis.  She was transferred to our hospital for
neurologic evaluation.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 98.9 HR: 95 BP: 185/75 RR: 16 O2:
99% on RA.  She had an LP which was notable for an opening
pressure of 20 cm.  She received vancomycin 1 gram IV x 1,
gentamycin 200 mg IV x 1 (3 mg/kg), and acyclovir 700 mg IV x 1
(10 mg/kg).  She has not yet received fungal coverage.  She was
seen by the neurology consult service who recommended a broad
workup for systemic causes of delerium including infectious
workup, toxicology screening, thiamine, folate and
multivitamins.  she was transferred to the MICU for further
management.

On arrival to the MICU she is oriented to person but otherwise
does not respond to questions.  She responds that her head
hurts.  She is agitated and moving in the bed.  Unable to obtain
review of systems.

Imaging:
Portable CXR 2008-07-19 00:00:00: Study is limited due to underpenetration
and
respiratory motion. The patient is also rotated. Cardiac
silhouette is
likely mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
grossly
unremarkable. The lungs are grossly clear. No sizable pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax is seen; however, the extreme right costophrenic
angle is
excluded from field of view.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram 2008-07-19 00:00:00: The left atrium and right
atrium are normal in cavity size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>65%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality.. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

EEG 2008-07-19 00:00:00: The patient was recorded entirely in stages I and II
of
sleep. It appeared that medication effect was evident both in
stages I
and II of sleep. Whether the presence of the seemingly excessive
amount
of sleep and the absence of full wakefulness was a pathological
condition or simply a manifestation of medication cannot be
determined
from this record. No discharging features were, however, seen in
the
record. There was no evidence for non-convulsive status, as
well.

Transesophageal Echocardiogram 2008-07-19 00:00:00: No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen
on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

MRI Brain 2008-07-19 00:00:00: Extensive white matter abnormalities involving
the posterior distribution as well as extending to involve the
frontal and parietal lobes in a watershed distribution. Given
the conciliation of these findings, these are again most
concerning for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
Again differential considerations include a toxic or metabolic
process.

Microbiology:
CSF 2008-07-19 00:00:00: No growth to date
Blood cultures 2008-07-19 00:00:00, 2008-07-19 00:00:00 (mycolytic), 2008-07-19 00:00:00, 2008-07-19 00:00:00 - no

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo woman with ho DM II on insulin (last A1C 5), PVD, Hep C,
and recent admission for septic R knee on fluconazole for
Abdalrahman Gill parapsilosis who presented to ED on 2008-07-19 00:00:00 for confusion
x 1 day.

# Delerium: Patient found to have multiple new white matter
lesions on CT that were initially thought to be infectious in
etiology. Patient was admitted to MICU for alcohol withdrawl
with very high BPs as well as DKA with AG. Infectious w/u of CNS
was negative with negative CSF and blood cx. An MRI head was
done for further evaluation of these lesions. Because of very
high BPs in MICU (probably due to severe DTs) and classic MRI
findings, the diagnosis of Posterior Reversible
Leukoencephalopathy (PRES) was made. Patient's pressures were
aggressively treated with goal systolics in 150s (close to her
baseline at home). Upon aggressive BP reduction, patient's
mental status significantly improved. On the floor the patient
continued to have a waxing and Donaldo Chaca delerium. Tight blood
pressure control continued with goal SBPs in the 150s. Neurology
followed the patient and recommended to continue close blood
pressure management with goal pressures 130s-150s systolic, as
well as to continue Fluconazole for fungal septic arthritis, and
continue close blood glucose management. These instructions were
followed. As blood pressure was stabilized to target levels with
multiple antihypertensive medications, tight glucose control was
obtained with Insulin Fixed and Sliding Scale, and antifungal
treatment continued, the patient's mental status showed
significant gradual improvement. Upon discharge on 2008-07-19 00:00:00, the Pt was alert and oriented X3, alert, interactive, and
appropriate. Patient has outpatient follow with Dr. Donaldo Chaca
in the dept of neurology.

# Type II Diabetes/Diabetic Ketoacidois:  On preentation the
patients anion gap was 23 with UA positive for ketones and
positive serum acetone.  Osmolar gap was 10 which was not
suggestive of a toxic ingestion and her lactate was not
elevated.  Toxicology screen was negative with exception of
benzodiazepines.  Renal function within normal limits.  Although
she is a type II diabetic it was felt that her acidosis was most
likely secondary to her diabetes versus alcoholic ketosis versus
starvation ketosis.  She was started on in insulin drip and
received aggressive IV hydration.  She was subsequently
transitioned back to a regimen of lantus with a regular insulin
sliding scale.  Her blood sugars remained elevated and her
insulin regimen required titration while in the ICU. While on
the floor the patient was started on in a humalog insulin
sliding scale, with fixed dose of glargine in the morning.  This
fixed dose and sliding scale was adjusted to obtain tight
control of her blood sugars.  Upon discharge, tight control was
obtained with most fingersticks between 100-200. Outpatient dose
of glargine increased from 18 units qAM to 45 units qAM. Suggest
continued uptitration as needed. Patient discharged on humalog
sliding scale. Would suggest restarting glyburide and stopping
humalog when discharged from rehab.

# Hypertension: Her blood presusres were grossly elevated on
presentation in the setting of missing her antihypertensive
medications and alcohol withdrawal.  She was initially treated
with IV medications and subsequently transitioned to an oral
regimen which was uptitrated.  At the time of MICU discharge she
was on a regimen of lisinopril 40 mg daily, HCTZ 25 mg daily,
labetolol 400 mg TID and hydralazine 30 mg PO QID.  At home her
blood pressures typically run in the 150s to 180s systolic per
her husband.  On the floor her blood medications were titrated
and altered to meet target goals of 130s-150s systolic.  Upon
discharge her blood pressure medications were Amlodipine 5mg
daily; Metoprolol 50 mg q6hours; HCTZ 25 mg daily; Hydralazine
25 mg q6hours; Lisinopril 40mg daily.  Instructions have been
provided in the discharge worksheet for how to continue to
titrate down these blood pressure medications as tolerated, in
order to maintain target BP levels and to simplify the
outpatient medication regimen.

# Fungal Knee Infection:  Cultures from 2008-07-19 00:00:00 grew Abdalrahman
Gill for which she has been on fluconazole.  She is
followed here by our infectious disease service. Given the
concerning lesions on her head CT she underwent an evaluation
for endocarditis including TTE and TEE which were negative for
vegitation.   On presentation there was an area of fluctance on
the right lateral knee with erythema and warmth concerning for
infection. This area was later aspirated by orthopedics and
found to grow Abdalrahman Gill parapsilosis.  Fluconazole is being
continued and the patient will likely require a course of
fluconazole that requires several months. She will continue to
be seen by orthopedics and infectious diseases as an outpatient
following discharge, and she has outpatient follow-up
appointments scheduled.

# Nutrition:  Patient was on tube feeds via NGT in the MICU.
Upon discharge she was tolerating a PO diet without difficulty
and had successfully passed a speech and swallow evaluation.

Patient was a FULL code on this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU)
because of confusion and severe alcohol withdrawl. Because of
your alcohol withdrawl, your blood pressures were dangerously
high. These high blood pressures caused brain damage and were
likely the cause of your persistent confusion. You are being
discharged UPMCE rehabilitation facility in good
condition, with stable vital signs. While you were hospitalized
your blood pressure was managed with medications which lowered
it to a safe level. As your blood pressure improved your mental
status improved.  During your hospitalization you were also
treated with Fluconazole for an infection in your knee. Also
during your hospitalization, we managed your blood sugars with
insulin. Your blood sugars were persistently elevated and
required close management to bring them to a safe level.
