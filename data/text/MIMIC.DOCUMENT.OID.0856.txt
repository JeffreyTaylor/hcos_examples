Date of Birth: 1970-04-28 00:00:00 00:00:00       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
female with known history of coronary artery disease referred
for outpatient cardiac catheterization secondary to a
positive stress test.  The patient had a PTCA stent to the
right coronary artery on 2012-05-02 00:00:00.  Cardiac catheterization
in 2012-05-02 00:00:00 showed 50% right coronary artery with a patent
stent, 50% mid left anterior descending, 75% circumflex, 95%
OM, and 70% diagonal.

The patient had been doing well and denied any chest pain.
She did report having dyspnea on exertion over the past 1-2
months and had been getting shortness of breath from walking
about a quarter of a mile.  She also had recently been
feeling very tired in general.

On 2012-05-02 00:00:00, the patient had an ETT Thallium with
report  which showed that the
patient exercised for 4?????? min with chest pain.
Electrocardiogram showed 2-123 Any St. depressions from inferior
to laterally.

The patient denied any claudication, orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, or light-headedness, but did have some
trace edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of Meniere's
disease and hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hysterectomy.  The patient also has a
history of a transient ischemic attack 25 years prior.

ALLERGIES:  DIURIL.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., Lopressor 100
mg b.i.d., 50 mg q.h.s., Diovan 160 mg q.d., Lipitor 40 mg
q.d., Premarin 0.625 mg q.d., Meclizine 12.5 mg q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.8, hematocrit 32.4, platelet
count 167; electrolytes within normal limits; INR 1.1;
baseline creatinine 1.0.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2012-05-02 00:00:00, which revealed elevated LDEDP.  Left ventricular
ventriculography showed mitral regurgitation.  The patient
had a short LMCA, a 70% lesions to the mid
left anterior descending, 85% origin, large diagonal, ramus
at 60%, 95% origin OM1, 95% OCX after OM1 affecting large more
distal second OM.  AV groove left circumflex occlusion before
PLV branch.  Right coronary artery showed mild mid right
coronary artery lesion, 90%, just before very large PVA with
just collateral source to the left circumflex and left
anterior descending diagonal territory.

Cardiac Surgery was consulted, and the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass grafting times four with LIMA to the
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal and to the OM, and saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery.  The patient tolerated the
procedure without complications but postoperatively the
patient had bleeding due to a coagulopathy and severe
hypertension which necessitated return to the
operating room for mediastinal exploration and cauterization
of several small bleeding sites and correction of the
coagulopathy with platelets, FFP and red cells.
The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation and
ventricular tachycardia on postoperative day #2.  The patient
was extubated on postoperative day #3 and had other of
ventricular tachycardia and premature atrial contractions.

On postoperative day #5, a carotid ultrasound was obtained
which showed less than 40% bilateral plaques.

Electrophysiology was consulted for assistance with
arrhythmias.  The patient remained in the unit until on
postoperative day #8 secondary to problems with hypertension
management.  Eventually a suitable regimen was obtained.

The patient was transferred to the floor and continued to do
well but did have early morning blood pressure elevations
which were eventually controlled by adding more hypertension
medications.

The patient began to have decreased bowel movements on
postoperative day #11 which prompted checking of a C-diff
with results that are pending at the time of this dictation.
Due to the hypertensive episodes, a renal ultrasound for
evaluation of possible renal artery stenosis was requested
and again is still pending at the time of this dictation.

On postoperative day #12, the patient had achieved relatively
good blood pressure control in the 140-160s over 50-70s.  The
patient was started on oral Flagyl prophylactically for
continued bowel movements.  The patient was pending physical
therapy clearance or evaluation for a rehabilitation facility
for the near future.

The patient is to follow-up in the EP Service, Dr. Mines
or Dr. Mines, UPMCE for follow-up after
discharge.

This discharge summary will have an addendum upon discharge.
