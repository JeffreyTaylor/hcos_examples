History of Present Illness:
A 71 year old male with PMH Cholelithiasis and biliary colic s/p
unsuccessful open cholecystectomy is called out of the MICU
after a one day hospitalization for hypotension following ERCP.
.
According to the patient, he had an episode of abdominal pain in
2012-12-07 00:00:00 and presented to UPMCE where he underwent an
attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was converted to an
open proceedure due to fibrosis. He reports that the surgeon was
able to remove some stones and closed leaving a bile drain in
place. He was then sent to UPMCE for ERCP on 2012-12-07 00:00:00 with
biliary stent placement which was successful. Following the
procedure, the patient noted decreased output from the external
biliary drain and had resolution of abdominal pain. On the day
of admission (2012-12-07 00:00:00) the patient presented for an repeat ERCP
to place a larger biliary stent which was performed
successfully. He returned home where he noted chills and an oral
temperature of 100.7. He called his PCP who recommended referral
to the ED. In the ED, initial VS were: 98.3 78 91/52 18 94%,
Labs were remarkable for WBC 5.0 73%PMN 3% Bands, he was given
amp/sulbactam and 2L IVNS and admitted to the MICU.
.
While in the MICU, antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and
zosyn. Biliary drain fluid was cultured with initial gram stain
showing Gram Neg Rods and Gram positive Cocci and culture
showing polymicrobial growth. ERCP fellow was 2012-12-07 00:00:00 who
noted that the fluid in a cholecystomy bag is rarely cultured
and is likely to be colonized with non-pathogenic bacteria. The
patient was given a total of 5 liters of fluid in the ED and
MICU. BP has now been stable without requring fluid for over 24
hrs and therefore patient was able to leave the MICU.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient denies any current complaints
and states that he feels as well as he normally does at home.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.

Other Studies:
==============
CXR 2012-12-07 00:00:00:
1. Diffuse interstitial opacities likely pulmonary fibrosis
(evidence of
asbestos exposure) with or without interstial pulmonary edema or
atypical
infection.
2. Dilated azygous vein indicates elevated central venous
pressure or volume.
.
CXR 2012-12-07 00:00:00:
As compared to the 123 Any St.us radiograph, there is no relevant
change. Borderline diameter of the azygos vein indicating
minimal systemic
fluid overload. However, there is no other indicator for
pulmonary fluid
overload, in particular no widening of the mediastinum, no
presence of pleural effusions and no interval enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette. Unchanged extensive bilateral interstitial
opacities, in the context of known pulmonary fibrosis. No
interval appearance of new focal parenchymal opacities.
.
TTE 2012-12-07 00:00:00:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild diastolic LV dysfunction. No
clinically-significant valvular disease seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, who
presented with fever and relative hypotension after elective
ERCP.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Fever, hypotension- This may have been related to transient
bacteremia from manipulation of tube during ERCP, however could
not exclude acending cholangitis therefore patient was started
on empiric antibiotics. Workup unremarkable for other localizing
source of infection.
- He will PO cipro and metronidazole based on discussion with
ERCP. Will complete a 7 day course of antibiotics as outpatient.
.
# Pancytopenia: Appears to be chronic based upon review of UPMCE records. No evidence of portal hypertension on exam.
Given diverse differential on CBC, concern for a marrow process.
 Patient is not deficient in B12, folate, or iron. These
findings do not appear to be directly related to current
admission but warrant further workup possibly including bone
marrow biopsy. However patient eager to go home and have any
further testing as outpatient with PCP. Felisitas Keelan risk is low based
on current values.
- PCP informed and will evaluate and refer appropriately at f/u
appointment
- Further workup as outpatient
.
# Hypoxemia- During his stay the patient was noted to have low
O2 sats on room air. Ambulatory O2 sats dipped as low as 79%
transiently. The patient denied any feeling of shortness of
breath. He reported that his breathing was at baseline. It was
unclear if he is chronically hypoxemic. The patient's PCP did
not have any PFT records available. OSH records indicated a
history of fibrotic lung disease and evidence of asbestosis
likely due to his career working in a ship-yard. Chest x-rays
performed here are concordant with this history. The patient's
PCP was Felisitas Keelan and he could not recall any history of
de-saturations to this degree. It is unclear what component of
his hypoxemia is from his chronic lung disease and what is
acute. It was initally thought that he had a component of
pulmonary edema because patient 5 liters positive in MICU and
CXR suggestive. Therefore he was diuresed with IV lasix and he
was clinically euvolemic but there was minimal improvement in
oxygenation. TTE showed preserved EF with mild diastolic
dysfunction. There was nothing obvious on history or physical to
suggest another etiology for patient's acute insult to his
chronic lung disease. He was low risk for Pulmonary Embolism
therefore CTA was not indicated. He has a long smoking history
however patient denied any known diagnosis of COPD and patient
was not on any COPD medications.
The patient was strongly opposed to any further workup while
inpatient and threatened to leave AMA on multiple occassions.
Therefore he will follow-up with his PCP tomorrow and will have
further workup including referral to pulmonology with CT and
PFTs as outpatient.
He was unable to maintain ambulatory O2 sats above 88% therefore
he will go home with O2. Patient, patient's wife, and daughter
all state they are committed to maintaining no smoking in the
home. They understand the risks including fire and serious
injury. Patient counseled on smoking cessation.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
# HTN- continue home lisinopril
.
# HL- cont home simvastatin
.
# Type II DM- continue home metformin
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Contact: Daughter (Felisitas Keelan) test@mail.com
- Patient's PCP will coordinate further workup of hypoxemia
including chest CT and referal to pulmonology
- Patient's PCP will coordinate further workup of pancytopenia

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Keelan,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had fever and low
blood pressure after your ERCP procedure. There was concern that
you could have a serious infection. Therefore you were admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit and given antibiotics and fluid to
help maintain your blood pressure. You did well and were able to
leave the ICU. You will take 2 more days of antibiotics when you
get home as described below.

An additional reason that you needed to stay in the hospital was
that your oxygen levels were low. Although you may not always
have symptoms, it is very dangerous to have low oxygen levels
for a long period. Part of the explanation for your low oxygen
levels may have been extra fluid in your lungs, therefore that
was removed with medication. However you still had low oxygen
levels afterwards. Most likely this is from lung disease that
you have had for some time. As we discussed, it is VERY
important that you and everyone else in your household quit
smoking. Oxygen is very flammable and can cause a fire. You will
need

The following additions were made to your medications:
START: ciprofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Twice daily. Last dose in
evening on 2012-12-07 00:00:00.
START: metronidazole 500 mg Tablet Three times daily. Last dose
in evening on 2012-12-07 00:00:00

You should continue taking all of your other medications as you
were 123 Any St.usly.

You will need to see your primary care doctor soon for further
evaluation of your lung disease. You also will need further
evaluation for your low blood counts.

Followup Instructions:
Name: VLAGOPOULOS,TRIPHON P.
Address: UPMCE, UPMCE,[**Numeric Identifier 4233**]
Phone: test@mail.com
Appointment: Wednesday 2012-12-07 00:00:00 2:00pm

Your Primary Care Doctor should refer you to see a pulmonologist
(lung specialist) for further evaluation.
