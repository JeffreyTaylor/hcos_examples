ART DUP LOW EXT RIGHT

FINDINGS:

Duplex evaluation of the right lower extremity arterial system
was performed which demonstrates a patent right common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal artery. Velocity in the right
common femoral artery is 112 cm/sec, with velocities ranging
between 70 to 87 cm/sec between the common femoral, and the
trifurcation.

IMPRESSION:

No stenosis seen in common femoral, superficial femoral and
popliteal arteries on the right.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: The heart size is within normal limits.
Mediastinal and hilar contours unchanged in the interval. The
aorta is slightly tortuous, unchanged. No focal consolidations
are seen. Again, seen is linear scarring at the left base,
unchanged. There is eventration of the posterior hemidiaphragms
unchanged. There is DISH again seen.
