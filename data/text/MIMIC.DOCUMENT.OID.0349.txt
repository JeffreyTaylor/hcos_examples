IMPRESSION:
1. S123 Any St. rupture with large hemoperitoneum. Subcentimeter foci
of
hyperdensity in the left upper quandrant with progressive
increased
conspicuity on venous and delayed phases favor nonarterial
etiology, although active arterial extravasation cannot be
excluded.

2. Two right lower lobe pulmonary nodules measuring 5 and 2.5
mm. In the
setting of breast cancer, followup in three months is
recommended. Probable post radiation treatment changes of right
anterior lung subpleural thickening.

3. Multiple foci of sclerosis within the bony pelvis may
represent bone
islands, however, in the absence of priors, metastatic lesions
cannot be
excluded in the setting of breast cancer. Recommend comparison
to any prior outside studies. Consider bone scan if these
findings have not already been evaluated.

4. No evidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Extensive
atherosclerotic
disease.

5. Nonspecific breast calcifications. Please correlate with
mammography



Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the ACS service and after discussing the
risks, benefits, and alternatives to emergency laparotomy and
possible splenectomy with the patient and the patient's family
she was immediately and emergently taken to the OR. Her
intraoperative course was stable. Postoperatively she was
transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. She remained
hemodynamically stable and was eventually transferred to the
regular nursing unit where she continued to progress.

She did have pain control issues requiring higher doses of
Dilaudid as she reported an allergy to Oxycodone. She was noted
to have a mild ileus felt secondary to the narcotics and was
given a 1 time dose of methylnaltrexone. Her diet was slowly
advanced and she is tolerating a regular diet. She is ambulating
independently.

She received her splenectomy vaccines prior to discharge and
will follow up with Dr. Azarria Buranen in Surgery clinic in the next
1-2 weeks for removal of her staples.
