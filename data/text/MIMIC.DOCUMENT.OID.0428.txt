pains for roughly seven minutes, which resolved.  The patient
was then worked up for a myocardial infarction once again and
was transferred to a Catheterization Lab for possible
angioplasty.

blood pressure 150/90, heart rate 50.  Neck: negative jugular
venous distention.  Chest is clear to auscultation.  Heart:
regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen: soft, nontender, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities: +1 dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 143, potassium 3.6, chloride 101,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on 2007-08-07 00:00:00 and

main coronary artery normal, left anterior descending long
50% to 60% after S1, LCM occluded, major marginal and
collaterals to distal vessels, right coronary artery distal
occlusion with left coronary collaterals.  On 2007-08-07 00:00:00

F, heart rate 100, respirations 22, blood pressure 105/70, O2
saturation 93% on room air, plus 5.5 kg.  Physical therapy
