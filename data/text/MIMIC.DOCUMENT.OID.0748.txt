Admission Date:  2009-02-12 00:00:00     Discharge Date:  2009-02-12 00:00:00

Date of Birth: 1929-07-22 00:00:00 00:00:00     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOVASCULAR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Persistent chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year-old
Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease status post four vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in 2009-02-12 00:00:00 who underwent evaluation of
chest and upper arm discomfort times several weeks.  In
addition the patient was also experiencing exertional chest
pain and dyspnea on exertion after one flight of stairs.  On
2009-02-12 00:00:00 the patient underwent an ETT thallium and
exercise for seven minutes by Deviana Kadwell protocol with chest pain,
but no significant EKG changes on a normal thallium study.
The patient was admitted to the CMI Service on 2009-02-12 00:00:00
and underwent coronary catheterization that same day.  During
this catheterization LV gram revealed a sustained ejection
fraction at 60% with evidence of a 70% proximal and 50% mid
stenosis of the SVT to PDA graft and a 30% proximal stenosis
of the SVG to OM2 graft as well as a 99% proximal stenosis of
the SVG to D1 graft.

The patient underwent PTCA and stent placement with no
residual stenosis of the SVG to D1 graft on the 8th with no
complications at that time.  Notably the patient also was
with a patent LIMA to LAD graft during his first
catheterization.  On the 2009-02-12 00:00:00 the patient returned to
the catheterization laboratory  and underwent a percu-surge
device procedure for the SVG to PDA lesion.  Notably this
artery had diffuse disease proximally with 80% ulcerated
stenosis and 40% mid stenosis.  The patient underwent PTCA
and stent with observation of TIMI-2 fast flow.  This
procedure was complicated by evidence of distal embolization
of the plaque during the procedure.  Hemodynamic monitoring
at this catheterization revealed RA pressure of 7, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 7, cardiac index of 2.5 with a
patent SVG to D1 stent.  The patient was kept on Integrilin
with a goal of 48 hours total therapy secondary to his
complicated catheterization.

Several hours after his second cath on 2009-02-12 00:00:00, the patient
had an acute drop in his systolic blood pressures to the
70's.  He responded with elevation of pressures after 500 cc
IV fluid bolus.  Telemetry also showed three episodes of five
beat nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  On the morning of


the 10th the patient was complaining of pleuritic chest pain
and mild shortness of breath.  CKs at this time were checked
and were notably rising compared to the prior day.  EKG at
this time revealed ST segment elevation of .5 to 1 mm in lead
3, AVF and precordial lead V2 to V4 ST depressions.  Later in
the evening the patient continued to have constant chest pain
associated only with shortness of breath.  The pain improved
in the semi-upright position, however, the patient had
minimal relief with increasing of an IV nitroglycerin drip or
morphine.  After consultation of the interventional
cardiology fellow it was believed that the patient was likely
having a subacute myocardial infarction as indicated by
ischemic changes on EKG and persistent chest discomfort post
cath in the setting of a complicated catheterization with
evidence of distal embolization.  It was the impression of
the staff interventional cardiologist that the patient was
not suitable to take back to the catheterization laboratory,
since there was no suitable therapy for small vessel distal
embolization.  The patient was transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit at this time for hemodynamic monitoring and for
close observation.

participate in any formal exercise program.  He is married
and has grown children.  Tobacco history as above.  The
patient is a former smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer, temperature
101.4.  Pulse 122.  Blood pressure 100/45.  Pulse 110.
Respirations 18.  O2 saturation is 100% on 2 liters.  24 hour
I and O are 11 35 and over 24 25 outs.  General, the patient
is a well appearing Caucasian male in no acute distress.
HEENT head is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Sclera and
conjunctiva are anicteric.  Oropharynx is clear without
erythema or exudate.  Neck is without evidence of JVD and


supple without obvious lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination reveals
a normal S1 S2, sinus tachycardia with a questionable
pericardial rub and 2+ bilateral distal pulses.  Abdomen is
soft and obese without tenderness, guarding or distention.
There were normoactive bowel sounds in all four quadrants and
no palpable hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are without
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurological examination the
patient is alert and oriented times four.  Cranial nerves II
through XII are grossly intact and motor and sensory
examination is otherwise nonfocal.  Rectal examination the
patient is guaiac negative.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count is 11.3,
hematocrit 30.2 down from 44.4 on admission.  Platelets are
196 with an MCV of 83.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.7, chloride
99, bicarb 27, BUN 12 and creatinine .9, serum glucose is
143.  Cholesterol is LDL Of 46, HDL of 35, triglycerides 129.
CK on transfer are 197 with an MB fraction of 25, 86 with an
MB fraction of 73 and 795 with an MB fraction of 70.  EKG on
transfer shows sinus tachycardia with a rate of 100, normal
axis and intervals with 1 mm ST segment elevations in 3 and
AVF, Q wave in 3 and AVF.  Diffuse T wave abnormalities
inferolaterally.

HOSPITAL COUSRE:  The patient was observed in the Coronary
Care Unit.  Upon transfer on admission the patient was
administrated .5 mg of Morphine sulfate after which time he
had complete resolution of his chest discomfort.  The patient
complained of no further shortness of breath.  The patient's
CKs were checked serially and the patient was noted to be
trending down on the day post transfer to the Coronary Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient was also noted to
be intermittently hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure
ranging 95 to 105, febrile and tachycardic.  He was evaluated
for possible bleeding source with a negative stool guaiac and
the patient had no complaint of back pain for suspicion of
retroperitoneal hematoma, nor did he have any presence of
groin hematoma from coronary catheterization.  Serial
hematocrits were checked and the patient was transfused one
unit of packed red blood cells and stable post transfusion
hematocrit.  However, the patient's systolic pressures
continued to remain low and the patient was still
intermittently tachycardic.  Hence he was transfused yet
another unit of packed red blood cells with resolution of his
intermittent hypotension and maintenance of his systolic
pressures into the 120's to 140's.  The patient was also
administered some Lasix and complained of no further episodes
of shortness of breath after brisk diuresis.  The patient
remained stable throughout the remainder of his Coronary Care
Unit stay.


He was transferred to the Cardiac Medicine floor and
underwent an transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate his
left ventricular function status post complicated
catheterization. This study revealed preserved ejection
fraction of 55 to 60% with mild mitral regurgitation, mild
tricuspid regurgitation. No evidence of pericardial effusion.
Poor visualization of the right hearted windows.  The
patient was discharged home on 2009-02-12 00:00:00 for follow up with
his primary care physician Clewis. Deviana Kadwell Densil Clewis and eventual
follow up with his outpatient cardiologist Dr. Deviana Kadwell Clewis
in UPMCE 123 Any St..

In discussion at the time of discharge with the patient's
medication regimen, he stated that he had a problem with beta
blockers in the past secondary to wheezing.  This was
discussed with the patient's inpatient attending Dr. Densil
Densil Clewis and it was felt that the patient would likely benefit
from either a low dose beta blocker and an optimize pulmonary
regimen including a steroid inhaler with Albuterol for break
through shortness of breath or wheezing as needed.  The
patient would follow up with any further pulmonary symptoms
with Dr. Deviana Kadwell or with his cardiologist upon next
evaluation.

FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS:  The patient is to follow up with Dr.
Clewis on 2009-02-12 00:00:00 and with Dr. Deviana Kadwell if needed on
2009-02-12 00:00:00 at 2:30 p.m.
