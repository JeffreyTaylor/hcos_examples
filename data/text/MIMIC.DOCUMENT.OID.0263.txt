Pertinent Results:
2014-10-30 00:00:00 Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of
the inferior wall.. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. A mobile density is
seen in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal
flap/aortic dissection. A mobile density is seen in the aortic
arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile
density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an
intimal flap/aortic dissection. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) to
Moderate [2+] aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
Navis was notified in person of the results on 2014-10-30 00:00:00
at 1715. Post bypass: Patient is A paced. LVEF= 40%. 2+ aortic
insufficiency present. (2 jets seen - one central and the other
eccentric. Mild mitral regurgitation present.

2014-10-30 00:00:00 Chest CT: 1. Type A aortic dissection with involvement of
the entire thoracic aorta and abdominal aprta as well as
multiple abdominal aprtic branches, described in detail above.
No evidence of aortic rupture. 2. Infrahilar lymphadenopathy,
unclear etiology, may be reactive. 3. Multiple pancreatic
hypodense lesions. Recommend further evaluation with
non-emergent MRCP. 4. Pulmonary, hepatic, and s123 Any St.
calcifications suggestive of granulomatous disease. 5.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

2014-10-30 00:00:00 Renal U/S: 1. No hydronephrosis. Simple bilateral renal
cysts. 2. Arterial and venous flow is seen bilaterally within
the kidneys.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. Navis was transferred to the ED by
EMS presenting with acute epigastric pain, chest pain, shortness
of breath and diaphoresis. He was found to have a type A aortic
dissection and was emergently transferred to the operating room
for repair. Please see operative note for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. He remained intubated for
several days due to respiratory failure and worsening
hypertension during extubation trial. Finally on post-op day two
he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. In addition on post-op day two, nephrology was
consulted for decreasing urine output and acute kidney injury.
He eventually required hemodialysis and was followed closely by
nephrology throughout his hospital course. Atrial fibrillation
was noted post-operatively (has history of) and he was
appropriately treated with beta-blockers and Amiodarone. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
had a swallow study performed due to a history of CVA which he
passed for a regular diet, thin liquids. On post-op day four he
was transferred to the step-down unit for further recovery.
Blood pressure medications were titrated to keep SBP<140.
Coumadin was eventually started for his atrial fibrillation and
history of CVA and his home dose was resumed.  He is to be
followed by the UPMCE Coumadin Clinic. Over the next
several days he remained stable while receiving hemodialysis.
Renal continued to follow, urine output slowly increased and
renal function was improved to a creatinine of 2.2 at the time
of discharge (peak cratinine 5.7.) Renal signed off with the
thought that renal function would continue to inprove, although
it may not return to baseline (1.5-1.6.)  Physicial therapy
worked with him for strength and mobility. On POD 8 he was
ambulating without difficulty, tolerating a full oral diet and
his incisions were healing well.  It was felt that he was safe
for discharge home at this time with VNA services.
