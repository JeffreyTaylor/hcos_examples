Service:Oncology
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Short of breath times one week plus
weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male with a history of metastatic lung cancer to brain,
failure to thrive.  He had a recent diagnosis on 2005-01-09 00:00:00 of
lung adenocarcinoma with metastases to Clyne, [**First Name3 (LF) **],
pericardium.  He had a recent admit for malignant pericardial
effusion with tamponade, status post drainage on 2005-01-09 00:00:00.  Plan
for chemotherapy after patient completes XRT.  Had an Lumbar
puncture on 2005-01-09 00:00:00 with negative meningeal spread of cancer.
He has noted one week prior to admission progressive increase
He had a pulses paradoxus of 15 in the emergency department.
No fever, chills, chest pain, cough, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain.  He had a normal p.o. intake but
decreased ambulation secondary to weakness post XRT.  Can go
approximately 10 steps and then gets tired with short of
breath.

In the emergency department he got a dose of Levofloxacin for
concern of pneumonia and bronchitis and stress dose steroids.

Chest x-ray shows increased in cardiac silhouette.
Electrocardiogram showed alternans.  Bedside echo concerning
for tamponade.  Catheterization laboratory for pericardial
drain placement.  Got 2500 cc's removed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, mitral valve prolapse, status post
melanoma.  Status post resection in 2005-01-09 00:00:00 and 2005-01-09 00:00:00.  Empyema
left lung 2005-01-09 00:00:00, status post thoracotomy and supraventricular
tachycardia.  Lung adenocarcinoma with metastases to brain,
[**Year (4 digits) 494**], pericardium.  Now undergoing brain XRT.  Atrial
flutter, peripheral visual loss.

An echo on 2005-01-09 00:00:00 showed EF greater than 55%

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Decadron 4 mg q AM, 2 mg q PM.
2.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
3.  Sotalol 80 mg twice a day.
4.  Ambien 10 mg q h.s.
5.  Lipitor 80 mg q h.s.
6.  Folate 1 mg q day.
7.  Accupril 10 mg q day.
8.  ASA 81 mg q day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with a daughter at home.  No tobacco
in the past 20 years, no alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission in general no acute
distress, pleasant, slightly tachypneic.  Vital signs 97.5,
heart rate 94, blood pressure 99/61.  Respiratory rate 36,
99% on 100% face mask.  Left pupil minimally reactive, down
visual acuity.  OP clear.  Neck: No jugular venous
distention.  Pulmonary:  Coronary artery disease bilaterally.
Carotids:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, no distension.  Bowel sounds positive.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  2+ distal
pulses bilaterally.  Neurological 5/5 strength bilaterally.
Pupils reactive.

Electrocardiogram on admission normal sinus rhythm,
electrical alternans.  Normal intervals, no ST changes or
Q-waves, diffuse T-wave changes.

LABS:  White blood count 9.6, hematocrit 36.1, platelets 128.
INR 1.3.  NA 137, K 4.6.  CL 104, CO2 20.  BUN 31, creatinine
0.8.  Glucose 140.

Chest x-ray shows increased in cardiac size, increased
pericardial effusion.  Increased left pleural effusion.
Lymphangitic tumor spread unchanged.  A left TTX new since
2005-01-09 00:00:00.

The patient was taken from the Emergency Room to the CCU for
close monitoring.  Given large pericardial effusion and
tamponade physiology.  On cardiac catheterization he
demonstrated low pressure tamponade with equalization of
right atrium and pericardial pressures.  After removal of
approximately one liter of bloody fluid his right atrial and
pericardial pressure decreased.  Procedure was notable for
pericardial preparation and partial pneumothorax given low
atrial/pericardial pressures and evidence of a possible small
left pneumothorax.  For this reason the drain was pulled.
However, subsequent review of the chest x-ray showed that the
finding of pneumothorax was present prior to the procedure.
Follow-up echocardiogram revealed resolution of electrical
alternans.  CT Surgery was consulted for possibility of
placing a pericardial window for definitive treatment of
recurrent pericardial effusions however, it was felt that a
procedure of this degree of invasiveness would likely lead to
patient's deterioration rather than improvement.

The decision was made that the patient would be best served
by a balloon pericardiocentesis via catheter done by
Cardiology however, this would require waiting until the
pericardial effusion re-accumulated.  Recommended that the
patient undergo q week transthoracic echocardiogram in order
to assess the size of pericardial effusion and when deemed
large enough the patient is to undergo balloon
pericardiocentesis.

The patient's cardiac status improved with this procedure
however, his respiratory status remained tenuous requiring
100% non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturations in the
mid-90%  The patient had marked dyspnea on exertion
throughout hospitalization.  It was felt that this is a
combination of intrinsic lung damage as well as lymphangitic
spread and some small degree of residual cardiac dysfunction.
Other than oxygen and nebulizers there is no further
therapeutic option for this patient at this time.  The
patient remained on Sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. as he was as an
outpatient for an supraventricular tachycardia and remained
in a normal sinus rhythm throughout hospitalization.

Hem/Onc.  The patient continued XRT as well as Decadron for
palliation.  He will be followed by Hem/Onc as an outpatient.
There were no gastrointestinal issues throughout this
hospitalization.

Infectious Disease.  The patient was not felt to be infected
and after the initial dose of Levofloxacin in the emergency
department antibiotics were discontinued.  The patient
remained afebrile.

Dictation will be completed with discharge diagnosis and
discharge medications prior to discharge.
