MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:
2009-04-09 00:00:00 MRSA screen - pending
.
IMAGING STUDIES:
2009-04-09 00:00:00 CT HEAD AND NECK W/ & W/O CONTRAST - No focal enhancing
lesion to suggest metastasis, although contrast-enhanced MRI
would be more sensitive for small metastatic lesions. Moderate
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Scattered
tiny hypodensities in the centra semiovale may represent
additional foci of small vessel ischemic disease or, possibly,
demyelinating disease. Further assessment could be performed by
MRI, if warranted and feasible. Nasopharyngeal mass is
incompletely imaged, and better-characterized on the concurrent
CT neck soft tissues.
.
2009-04-09 00:00:00 CT CHEST, ABDOMEN, PELVIS W/CONTRAST - pending

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 94F with PMH significant for hypertension and
hypothyroidism who presented with nasal congestion, post-nasal
drip and serous otitis media found to have large nasopharyngeal
mass (now s/p nasal endoscopy with biopsy and bilaterally
myringotomy and tube placement) biopsy-proven lymphoma who was
referred to the ED for further evaluation and management with
stable oxygen saturations and no clinical evidence of airway
obstruction.
.
# NASOPHARYNGEAL LYMPHOMA, AIRWAY CONCERNS ?????? The patient
presented with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal lymphoma referred
from home by her ENT surgeon (Dr. Wootten given the mass burden
of her tumor and her symptoms of left facial and ear pain. She
had no evidence of clinical airway obstruction or compromise on
exam. She remained on ambient room air with saturations of
96-99%. She received Dexamethasone 20 mg IV x 1 in the ED. After
discussion with Hematology-Oncology, we continued steroids,
discharged her home with clinic follow-up after a staging CT and
2D-Echo performed prior to discharge. Per ENT surgery's
recommendations, we continued Ciprodex otic 5 gtts to left ear
UPMCE x 5-days to maintain myringotomy tube patency, nasal saline
spray TID and saline nebulizer treatments and biotene PRN. She
was discharged in stable condition with close Oncology
follow-up.
.
# HYPERTENSION - Asymptomatic with stable BP on admission. We
continued Atenolol 50 mg PO daily.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM ?????? Stable without active symptoms. We continued
her home Levothyroxine 75 mcg PO daily.
.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
1. Patient was discharged with Oncology, primary care and ENT
surgery follow-up scheduled.
2. At the time of discharge, the patient had a 2D-echocardiogram
and CT abdomen pending. Both studies were performed, but the
final read will be reviewed by her Oncologist.

3-days until clinic follow-up with Oncology.
