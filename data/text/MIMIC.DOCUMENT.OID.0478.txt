History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 79 y/o Russian
speaking female with a hx of Pulmonary MAC diagnosed in 2013-09-02 00:00:00, on
standing clarithromycin, ethambutol and rifampin, complicated by
bronchiectasis who presented from home with worsening shortness
of breath, cough and sputum production for 2 days.  Patient
reports that yesterday her breathing started becomming more
difficult with increased cough productive of yellow/clear sputum
without associated fevers or chills.  Her breathing improved
with clearing of her secretions, however this morning she was
unable to produce any phlegm and her breathing became much more
labored.  She presented to the ED due to worseing SOB.  She
denies recent chest pain, pleuritic pain, nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea.  Per her husband she has had less energy and decreased
a123 Any St.e since her last hospitalization, however her breathing
had been stable until 2 days ago. Patient denies night sweats,
however, reports increased weight loss over the past months.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to UPMCE on 2013-09-02 00:00:00 with
similar complaints.  Imaging at that time showed progression of
widespread small airway bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis.  She
was admitted to the ICU however did not require intubation or
steroids.  She completed 5 days of cefepime per ID
recommendations and completed an additional 10 day course of
cefpodoxime 200mg po BID for presumed CAP.
.
In the ED VS initially showed T 96.7 BP 149/84 HR 89 RR 28-48 O2
sat 97% on RA.  CXR showed interval improvement in the
multifocal patchy opacities 123 Any St.usly noted.  She was given one
dose of cefepime and ASA 325mg x1.  She was placed on oxygen for
comfort and then desaturated into the 80's and was placed on NRB
with inc. in her oxygen sat to 100%, however she remained
tachypneic.  Due to inability to wean off NRB she was admitted
to the ICU for further treatment.

2013-09-02 00:00:00 CXR: Marked interval improvement in 123 Any St.usly noted
peripheral
basilar opacities consistent with essential resolution of active
MAC
infection.  There are subtle areas of increased density noted
medially in the left apex and laterally in the bilateral lung
bases which likely correspond to the stigmata of the chronic
infection.
.
2013-09-02 00:00:00 CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism is noted.
2. Presence of multiple fluid filled bronchi, thickening along
the axial interstitium, development of multiple new inflammatory
nodules and worsening of the primary sites of bronchiolitis
suggest worsening of the patient's underlying
bronchiectasis/bronchiolitis .
3. Atelectatic changes of the right middle lobe. Small bilateral
pleural effusion.
4. Mitral annulus calcification and significant calcification of
the coronary arteries appear unchanged.
.
2013-09-02 00:00:00 2D Echo:
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD

lesion). Mild mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the report
(images unavailable for review) of 2013-09-02 00:00:00, the regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction is new.
.
C.CATH Study Date of 2013-09-02 00:00:00
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
two-vessel coronary artery disease.
--The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--The mid-LAD had a 50% stenosis.  D1 had a 60% stenosis.
--The LCx had no angiographically apparent disease.
--The RCA had a 40% ostial stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed low right-sided filling
pressures with
RA mean 3 mmHg.  PA and PCW pressures were not obtained -- it
was not
possible to advance the swan-ganz catheter into the PA easily so
the
right-heart catheterization was aborted aver RV pressures were
obtained.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF 44%,
moderate
anterolateral hypokinesis, and no mitral regurgitation.
4.  At the beginning of arterial access, a small 3x3cm hematoma
developed at the site of arterial puncture.  Manual pressure was

performed, and by com123 Any St.n of the case there was resolution of
the
hematoma with no evidence of recurrence or extension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate coronary artery disease most suitable for continued
medical
therapy.
2. Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with low
filling
pressures.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo Russian speaking female with a hx of Pulmonary MAC
complicated by bronchiectasis who presented with worsening
shortness of breath and hypoxia and found to have recent MI.
.
# Shortness of Breath/Hypoxia:  Pt was admitted to the UPMCE as
she could not be weaned off NRB.  The SOB is likely due to a
combination of exacerbation of COPD, bronchiectasis (improved on
CXR), pneumonia, and subacute left ventricular dysfunction.  Pt
was started on IV methylpred along with levalbuterol/ipatropium
nebulizer treatments.  CTA on 2013-09-02 00:00:00 ruled out PE.  ID was
consulted and did not feel the pt's chronic MAC infection is the
cause of the respiratory distress.  She was started on
vancomycin and Zosyn.  Vancomycin was discontinued when gram
stain of sputum from 2013-09-02 00:00:00 returned with GNRs.  Sputum culture
grew Pseudomonas, which pt was known to be colonized with.
Given that pt remained afebrile without leukocytosis, Zosyn was
discontinued as recommended by ID.  After discussion with her
pulmonologist Dr. Fortuna, it was decided to treat her for
pneumonia and she was dischared on 7 more days of Cefpodixime.
She was continued on her MAC triple antibiotic therapy:
ethambutol, clarithromycin, and rifampin.  Pt is scheduled for
follow-up with ID and Pulmonology as outpatient.  Pt was
discharged on steroid taper, nebulizer, Cefpodixime, and MAC
triple antibiotic therapy.
.
# CAD with recent MI:  As part of her SOB work-up, she was
evaulated for MI.  ECG showed possible V1-V4 STE and biphasic Ts
new since 2013-09-02 00:00:00.  Pt had elevated troponins, peaking at 0.44 on
day of admission, with nl CKs; heparin gtt was started.  ECHO on
2013-09-02 00:00:00 showed new moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with near akinesis/aneurysm of the distal
third of the ventricle and hypokinesis of the mid-septum and
mid-anterior walls; LVEF = 30% (60-65% in 2013-09-02 00:00:00).  Cardiology was
consulted and felt that this injury represented a recent
myocardial infarction from the 123 Any St.us days to weeks.  Pt was
started on a statin and plavix in addition to her aspirin and
beta-blocker. Pt had a cardiac catheterization on 2013-09-02 00:00:00 that
showed moderate disease without intervenable lesions, likely
prior MI that revascularized.  Pt was transferred to the
cardiology service post-catheterization.  She was maintained on
heparin gtt until warfarin was therapeutic for the akinetic
distal ventricle.  Plan is to anticoagulate for at least 6
months.  Fortuna was also added as blood pressure tolerated.  After
discussion with Dr. Fortuna, it was decided that the pt would
not continue with plavix given her pulmonary status and
propensity for hemoptysis.  Pt is to follow-up with her PCP,
UPMCE, and cardiologist.  Pt had requested Dr.
Jasun Marrale as her cardiologist and a follow-up appointment was
made.
.
# CHF, EF 30%:  Pt appeared euvolemic throughout ther hospital
stay.  Pt was discharged on her outpatient beta-blocker
propranolol and valsartan.
.
# Palpitations:  This may be due to increased albuterol use.  A
recent TSH in 2013-09-02 00:00:00 was 1.3.  Pt had no sig. events on tele.
.
# Loose stools:  Pt complained of loose, small-volume stools
2-3x during the nights, associated with cramping.  DDx inc.
viral gastroenteritis, side effect of medications (new meds
included Zosyn, statin at the time), C. diff 2013-09-02 00:00:00 Zosyn (c. diff
neg x1, afebrile, no leukocytosis noted).
.
# Hyponatremia on admission: This resolved slowly with IV NS on
admission and return of her a[** Location **]e.
.
# Head Tremor:  Pt was continued on her outpatient propranolol.

.
# HTN: She was continued on her outpatient propranolol and
started on valsartan.
.
# GERD: Pt was restarted on PPI with administration of high-dose
steroids.
