Attending:Hatsumi Bricher
Chief Complaint:
fever, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
72yo F quadri123 Any St. with chronic indwelling foley, presented
from UPMCE to UPMCE ED via EMS on 2011-09-26 00:00:00 w/ decreased mental
status, cloudy urine, fever, and hypotension.
.
In the ER, her SBP dropped quickly from 100 to 60s and code
sepsis called. She was noted to have milky white urine coming
from her indwelling foley catheter. Her foley catheter was then
changed and she was started on IV abx - zosyn (despite report of
vague allergy) and linezolid. She initially required pressors
for blood pressure control.
.
Early in the UPMCE course pt was weaned off pressors. Blood cx's
returned with pan sensitive e. coli. Urine culture at present is
grown two separate GNR's, and decision was made to continue with
double GNR coverage (Zosyn and levofloxacin) out of concern for
possible reistant pseudomonas. Other complication early in
course of UPMCE stay included reanl failure which is responding
well to re-hydration. Pt also complained of a headache in the
UPMCE. CT of head was without acute findings, and headache
responded fully to tylenol, therefore no further work up was
pursued by the UPMCE team.
.
On arrival to floor pt denies any complaints.

PATHOLOGY:
Skin, left forearm, superficial epidermis ('jelly roll')
specimen (A):
     Thin strips of epidermis with minimal necrosis, see note.
Note: The vast majority of the epidermis present in this
specimen is viable, arguing against a diagnosis of
TENS/123 Any St.. While a few eosinophils are noted adjacent
to the epidermis, in the context of such a superficial specimen,
the finding is not specific. The separation of the epidermis
appears to be at the dermal-epidermal junction. Dr. Amesquita
notified of diagnosis on 2011-09-26 00:00:00.
.
IMAGING:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The evaluation
of the upper abdomen is severely limited due to beam hardening
effect from patient's arms.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left, with bilateral dependent atelectasis.
In this limited evaluation of the upper abdomen, the liver,
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are unremarkable.
There is no large stone in the kidneys, and both kidneys are
excreting contrast symmetrically. The aorta and its major
abdominal branches are patent. There is no evidence of bowel
obstruction.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The 123 Any St.usly
seen (2011-09-26 00:00:00 CT) right retroperitoneal/paracolic
gutter fluid collection is no longer visualized. Large bowel
diverticulosis is present without evidence of diverticulitis. A
small amount of free fluid is present in the presacral area.
Additionally, there is extensive subcutaneous edema consistent
with anasarca.
There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions in the osseous
structures. Degenerative changes are noted.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the
above findings.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Anasarca with bilateral small pleural
effusions and small amount of fluid in the presacral area. Large
bowel diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. No
evidence of renal stones but since the evaluation is limited an
ultrasound can be helpful if there is a persistent concern for
renal stones.
.
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST.
CLINICAL INDICATION: Mental status changes. Assess for
intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple axial images are obtained from base to vertex without
intravenous contrast administration. Comparison is made to the
prior head CT from 2011-09-26 00:00:00.
There are no focal lesions seen within the brain parenchyma. The
sensitivity of the examination is lower due to the lack of
intravenous contrast administration. No midline shift, mass,
mass effect, or hemorrhage is noted. A small low density is seen
within the right frontal lobe on image 23, suggestive of an old
infarct. This was present on the 123 Any St.us exam. The calvarium is
intact. There is no subdural hemorrhage. Slightly decreased
attenuation is noted involving the left frontal white matter,
which probably represents volume averaging. The calvarium is
intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen.
.
2011-09-26 00:00:00 CXR - The tip of a right internal jugular vein overlies
the mid SVC. The radiograph is otherwise insignificantly
changed. Numerous calcified granulomas scattered throughout both
lungs with upper lobe predominance. No airspace consolidations
are identified. The heart and mediastinal contours with a
calcified aorta are unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter overlying mid SVC without
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
# E coli Urosepsis:
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU per the sepsis
protocol.  She was managed with levophed and IVF to sustain her
blood pressure and was covered broadly with linezolid (given h/o
VRE) + zosyn.  Once GNR identified in blood, linezolid was d/c
and patient was double covered with levofloxacin/zosyn pending
sensitivities.  Blood cultures grew pan sensitive E coli and
thus antibiotics were tailored to levofloxacin only with a plan
for a total of 14 days to treat.  Her foley was replaced and
repeat urinalysis and urine culture 2011-09-26 00:00:00 negative for evidence
of persistent infection and surveillance blood cultures are
negative.  Initial urine culture was contaminated. No other
source of infection identified: CT abdomen for continued stomach
spasms was negative for inflammatory pathology and CXR was
without evidence of an infiltrate.  Of note, numerous calcified
granulomas throughout both upper lung zones (seen on 123 Any St.us
CXRs here at UPMCE) suggest history of remote tb or histo
exposure.  No current cough to suggest active infection.
.
# Bullous rash:
Patient developed superficial bullae on her left forearm at the
site of an IV infiltration.  Dermatology was consulted for
concern for SJS or TEN.  Patient refused punch biopsy but shave
biopsy showed no evidence of epidermal necrosis to suggest TEN
or SJS.  Possibility of bullous pemphigoid was considered, but
punch bx would be needed to diagnose this.  Aspirate gram stain
and culture were negative for underlying infection.  Treatment
would likely be topical steroid given age and comorbidities.
However, no further lesions have developed.  Plan to continue
current wound care for now with PCP Amesquita.
.
# Acute renal failure:
Admission creatinine 2.3.  FENa 0.46%, suggesting prerenal.
Creatinine returned to baseline with IVF.
.
# Headache:
Patient complained of pain behind her eyes while in the ICU.
Ophthamology was consulted and found no evidence of acute
issues.  Head CT showed no evidence of bleed.  Patient refused
LP and headache responded to tylenol.  Patient continues to have
occasional tension in the right temporal region, which improves
with massage to the area.
.
# Anemia:
Patient's hematocrit remained stable between 25-26.  B12 was low
and is being repleted IM.  Folate and iron studies were normal.
Elevated ferritin suggestive of possible AOCD.
.
# Muscle spasms:
Patient has been having increased muscle spasms since her
admission.  On the day of discharge, these have improved some.
In addition, whe will be given an additional noontime dose of
her tizanidine in hopes of improved symptom relief.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's atenolol and nifedipine have been
held.  These can be slowly reintroduced if her blood pressure
remains elevated.
.
# Psych: Continued on mirtazapine
.
# FEN: Nutrition was consulted given albumin 2.8.  Patient
refused boost supplements.  Would recommend increase protein in
diet.  Patient admitted with hypernatremia (148).  This improved
in the ICU with D5W.  She again required D5W for correction on
the day of discharge and will need her sodium rechecked in 2
days.
