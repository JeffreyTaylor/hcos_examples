Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 71 year old male with history of bilateral
spontaneous pneumothoraces, LUL blebectomy, found to have a LLL
PNA on admission. He presented with c/o six days of fatigue and
productive cough and a day of L sided pleuritic chest pain. On
the day PTA, he was seen by his PCP who prescribed him a
tetracycline. In the ED, the patient was saturating 100%RA and
CXR revealed a LLL infiltrate, so he was started on
Levofloxacin. His initial BP was 94/47 so he was given 2 L of
NS, causing his oxygen saturation to drop to the low 90s on NC.
His SBP transiently dropped to 67/32 and improved to the
90s-100s systolic after another L of NS. He was noted to have
diffuse rales, and was given CTX 1 gm IVx1 and started on CPAP.
.
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned to 2 L NC and his SBP came up
to the 100s. He received Lasix 10 mg IV x1. He was continued on
levofloxacin for treatment of PNA. His Creatinine improved from
1.7 back down to 1.3 after IV hydration. TTE performed on
2008-01-01 00:00:00 showed a normal EF of 55% and no focal wall motion
abnormalities (although a poor quality study). Prior to
transfer, he was satting 95% 2LNC at rest, but would desat to
84% on 3LNC with ambulation. He remained afebrile in the MICU,
SBP 90s-110s, and HR 45-55.
.
At this time, the patient states he continues still have a mild
left lower chest pain with inspiration (improved from prior). He
also continues to have a productive cough with yellow sputum.
His a123 Any St.e is improving again and his headaches have resolved.
.
Review of Systems:
He reports several pounds of weight loss over the past week. He
denies n/v, dysuria, diarrhea, constipation, headache.

Past Medical History:
#numerous spontaneous bilateral pneomothoraces; s/p LUL
blebectomy and right-sided decortication
#hypothyroidism
#hyperlipidemia
#s/p pharyngocele resection
#chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5);
etiology unclear

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
Chest x-ray (portable) 2008-01-01 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Worsening left parahilar and left lower lobe
pneumonic consolidation and new interstitial abnormality due to
interstitial pulmonary edema, most evident in the right lung.
.
Chest X-ray PA and Lateral 2008-01-01 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity concerning for pneumonia.
.
EKG 2008-01-01 00:00:00:
Sinus bradycardia. Borderline P-R interval prolongation. J point
and
ST segment elevation diffuseness raises the possibility of
pericarditis.
However, ST segment elevations were present on tracing of 2008-01-01 00:00:00
but
to a lesser degree. Left ventricular hypertrophy persists.
 .
Transthoracic Echo 2008-01-01 00:00:00:
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a very small posterior pericardial effusion without
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2008-01-01 00:00:00, a very small posterior pericardial
effusion is now present.

.
2008-01-01 00:00:00:
EKG
Sinus bradycardia. The P-R interval is prolonged. Diffuse ST
segment
elevation. Non-specific anterior ST-T wave changes. Compared to
the prior
tracing anterior ST-T wave changes are new. ST segment elevation
persists.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 71 year old man with a history of spontaneous
pneumothoraces and subsequent LUL lobectomy, who presented with
cough and pleuritic chest pain, found to have a LLL PNA, with
asymptomatic hypotension.
.
# LLL PNA: Patient presented with community-acquired bacterial
pneumonia, however there could have been a component of
post-obstruction in nature. He received levofloxacin while in
MICU, after getting dose of ceftriaxone in ED. Urine was
negative for legionella. Viral antigen test was negative for
influenza.
- He was to complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin 500 mg po
daily.
- Viral and sputum cultures demonstrated no significant growth
aside from oropharyngeal flora. Blood and urine cultures were
negative.
- Patient received influenza vaccination and Pneumovax
vaccinations.
- Patient was weaned off of oxygen with ambulatory saturation of
92-97% on room air at time of discharge.
-
.
# Hypotension: Patient's hypotension was of unclear in etiology
and he remained asymptomatic without tachycardia,
lightheadedness, or other symptoms. Orthostatics were checked
and were positive. Hypotension appeared finally respond to
several intravenous fluid boluses given over the course of his
stay. His output remained good, no lightheadedness, mentation at
baseline, intact.
.
Appears as though the patient's blood pressure was checked daily
after he got out of bed to chair, and it was felt that the low
readings obtained had to do with a strong component of
orthostatic hypotension. Patient did not have DM, Parkinsons,
MS, or other clear reason for autonomic dysfunction and did not
appear to be septic. A cortisol stimulation test was within
normal limits.
.
An echo completed during his MICU stay did not reveal any
significant pericardial effusion, and his EKG was relatively
unchanged. His primary care physician related his usual systolic
blood pressure was in the 100s to 110s, and at time of
discharge, his SBP was >100.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient needed oxygen initially, however he was able
to be weaned off of it by time of discharge. He remained
asymptomatic and did not feel short of breath. In the ED, he had
acute desaturation that was felt to be related to volume
resusitation, which may have just been too rapid. His TTE showed
normal EF and no focal WMA or diastolic dysfunction, but it was
a poor study. It is suspected that his hypoxia is likely
secondary to his PNA with possible mild pulmonary edema, but his
JVP is normal without other evidence of volume overload on exam.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency: His baseline creatinine is
1.3-1.5. On admission his Cr was 1.7, which improved with
intravenous fluids and returned to his baseline at time of
discharge.
.
# Anemia: His hematocirt remained stable, although down to the
high 20s (29), from his baseline is 33-35. He had no evidence of
bleeding, and it was felt that at least in part the anemia was
worsened by dilutional effect.
- Iron studies, retic count, B12, folate were checked, and
studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease (low iron, low
TIBC).
.
# Sinus bradycardia: This appears to be chronic, per reports
from prior ECGs on the OMR. Nodal agents were avoided.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient's statin was continued.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine was continued.
.
# Depression: Sertraline at 100mg was continued.
.
# Patient was full code during his admission. He was evaluated
by physical therapy and felt to be safe for discharge. Follow up
was arranged with his primary care physician.
