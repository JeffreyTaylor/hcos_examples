CT c-spine:
1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
2. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and C3 on C4 which may be

degenerative, although this cannot be confirmed without prior
studies. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of C4 over C5 with mild kyphosis
and moderate canal stenosis.
3. Moderate spinal canal stenosis at C4-5 and C5-C6, which could
123 Any St.pose the patient to cord injury in the setting of minor
trauma. MRI is recommended for further assessment of cord or
ligamentous injury, provided the patient has no
contraindications to MRI.

2012-05-03 00:00:00
CT Head:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No acute skull
fracture, within the limitations of slight motion.

2012-05-03 00:00:00
CT abdomen/pelvis/chest:
1. Moderate to large right pneumothorax with a small component
of
hydropneumothorax.
2. Large hiatal hernia containing fluid. Fluid in the entire
esophagus,
placing the patient at risk for aspiration.
3. Emphysema.
4. Posterior right rib fractures 5 through 11.
5. Multiple compression deformities of the thoracic and lumbar
spine as
detailed above, age indeterminate.
6. Extensive subcutaneous gas of the neck, abdomen, pelvis and
right arm.
Pneumomediastinum.
7. Diverticulosis, no evidence of diverticulitis.

2012-05-03 00:00:00 EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Low QRS voltage. Consider prior inferior
myocardial infarction. Prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Since the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2012-05-03 00:00:00 delayed R wave progression
is more prominent but there may be no significant change.

2012-05-03 00:00:00 echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is
a mid-cavitary LV systolic gradient, which increases with the
Valsalva maneuver. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a promient fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied and hyperdynamic left ventricle
with a mid-cavitary gradient. Moderate pulmonary hypertension

2012-05-03 00:00:00 CXR
No pneumothoraces are seen on either side. There is again seen a
very large hiatal hernia which is less air-filled. There are
bilateral pleural
effusions, right side worse than left, which are unchanged from
prior. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is
demineralization of the thoracic spine with some compression
deformities.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Trauma Surgical Service after
transfer from the OSH. She was s/p fall with multiple right rib
fractures and right pneumothorax. The chest tubes were placed to
suction. She also had lumbar and thoracic spinal compression
fractures which were non-operative; neurosurgery was consulted.
She was initially admitted to the surgical trauma ICU for
monitoring of her respiratory status. The patient was
hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: Initially pain service was consulted regarding epidural
anasthesia. However, that was not done, and instead the patient
received IV morphine with good effect and adequate pain control.
She also recieved a transdermal lidocaine patch to the chest.
She recieved Tylenol and Toradol. On 2012-05-03 00:00:00, she was strated on
PCA dilaudid. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications, namely in liquid form and
that was easier for her to tolerate. Pain service was involved
to manage pain.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Cardiac
anzymes were monitored multiple times and were negative. The EKG
was performed on 2012-05-03 00:00:00, which was not suspicious for acute
ischemia. The echo was done on 2012-05-03 00:00:00, the results are detailed
in the 123 Any St.us section.

Pulmonary: Patient was admitted with the right pneumothorax and
subcutaneous emphasema along the right lateral chest wall and
flank extending inferiorly to about right anterior superior
iliac spine. At the time of admission she had one chest tube
placed and later on the same day she had a second chest tube
placed to suction. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and
incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization. She recieved albuterol and ipratropium as
needed for shortness of breath. Both of the two chest tube were
removed on 2012-05-03 00:00:00.Subsequetly, patient experienced some
respiratory distress on 2012-05-03 00:00:00; she had small apical pneumothorax
on CXR. The respiratory distress was treated with nebulizers,
cpap and diuresis. Her repiratory status was monitored in the
trauma ICU until 2012-05-03 00:00:00, when she was transferred to the floor.
Two days later she experienced respiratory distress and was
transferred back to the ICU on 2012-05-03 00:00:00. Subsequntly, patient was
intubated in the ICU and chest tube was placed on the right
side. She continued to have an air leak, the chest tube stayed
to suction. Treatment with vancomycin and cefepime were started
for presumed pneumonia. Patient's respiratory status improved
and she was extubated on 2012-05-03 00:00:00 and transferred to the floor.

She did well on the floor, even though she had a persistent air
leak. Attempts were made to clamp the chest tube, she initially
did not tolerate it. The pleurodesis was done by thoracic
surgery service at bedside. Patient tolerated it well. Several
days later, the air leak largely disappeared, patient eventually
tolerated clamping and chest tube to water seal for almost 48
hours. The chest tube was then removed and patient remained in
good respiratory status with no residual pneumothorax on chest
x-ray. Patient recieved daily chest x-rays to monitor her right
sided pneumothorax.

By the time of discharge patient was on her home dose on
supplemental oxygen, sating well over 92%.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

Patient was kept NPO initially secondary to large hiatal hernia
and concern for aspiration risk. She had a speech and swallow
evaluation on 2012-05-03 00:00:00. The recommendations were diet of thin
liquids and pureed consistency solids, medications to be crushed
with the liquids, one on one supervision and nutrition consult
was recommended. Recommended diet was started following this
evaluation.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. She remained afebrile.
The sputum cultures were sent once, but contained only
respiratory flora. Patient was treated with vancomycin and
cefepime for presumed pneumonia.

Stool was sent on 2012-05-03 00:00:00 for Clostridium difficile analysis. There
was no growth.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required. Her anemia was at
baseline.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible with physical therapy.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet with supplements, ambulating with assisstance, voiding, and
pain was well controlled. Her respiratory status was much
improved and stable, at her baseline. The patient received
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
