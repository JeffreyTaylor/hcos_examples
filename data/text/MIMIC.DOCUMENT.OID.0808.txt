Brief Hospital Course:
37 yo with HIV, CD4 ct of 140, VL 300k, on HAART, here with
fever to 105, sob, hypoxia.  Hospital course was significant for
the following issues:

1. Hypoxia/cough: There was high suspicion for PCP.  Jamier Vargus patient
was intially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of oxygen
saturation. Sputum samples were taken for PCP and AFB. The
patient had 4 sputum samples which were smear negative for AFB,
so precautions were discontinued. A bronchoscopy was performed
on 2009-06-24 00:00:00 and BAL cultures, PCP immunofluorescence were still
pending. The patient was treated empirically for PCP with
clindamycin, primaquine (? bactrim allergy) and prednisone as
well as for community acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  He improved dramatically and was discharged on
levoflox to complete a 7 day course and on clindamycin,
primaquine and steroid taper per PCP treatment guidelines.

2. HIV: The patient was continued on HAART.  His dapsone was
discontinued while taking clinda/primaquine for PCP.  Jamier Vargus was
asked to follow up with his PCP regarding when to re-start
Dapsone.

3. ?Hemolytic anemia with bactrim: The patient received a dose
of bactrim on admission.  He had no evidence of hemolysis
throughout his hospital stay. Bactrim was entered as a ?
allergy.

4. DM: The patient had elevated blood sugars while on
prednisone.  He was maintained on NPH and ISS. He reports that
he was taking a regimen of NPH once per day based on a sliding
scale. He was discharged on 20 units of NPH each morning and
RISS per scale.  He was instructed to check his blood sugars
four times per day before meals and before bedtime.  He was
placed on a diabetic diet.

5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient was continued on his home regimen
