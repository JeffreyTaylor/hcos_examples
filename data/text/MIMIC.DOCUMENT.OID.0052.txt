2010-08-29 00:00:00 CT Abd/pelvis :
High grade small bowel obstruction with dilated proximal loops
and decompressed distal loops with a transition point likely at
the site of right femoral hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. Maggard was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the
Emergency Room and based on her physical exam and abdominal CT
she was admitted to the ICU for IV hydration, gastric
decompression and monitoring of her renal failure with operative
repair once she is fluid resuscitated.  Her creatinine was 2.2
on admission then decreased to 1.7 after 24 hours.

On 2010-08-29 00:00:00 she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy and repair of her right
femoral hernia.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned
to the PACU in stable condition.  She maintained stable
hemodynamics and her pain was minimal.  She was transferred to
the Surgical floor and continued to make slow progress.  Her
abdominal wound was healing well and she worked with Physical
Therapy to increase her mobility.

Her diet was slowly advanced but she had problems with emesis
and it took quite a bit of time for her bowel function to
resume. Erythromycin and Reglan were started as pro motility
agents but she developed diarrhea with these and they were
stopped. Stool for C. difficile was sent and came back negative.
At baseline she has a limited a123 Any St.e and was started on
Marinol as an a123 Any St.e stimulant with significant improvement in
her a123 Any St.e.

Her abdominal staples were removed on 2010-08-29 00:00:00. She is being
recommended for rehab and is being discharged from the hospital
after an extended stay following her surgery.
