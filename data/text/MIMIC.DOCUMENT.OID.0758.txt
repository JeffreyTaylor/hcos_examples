Attending:Audreyanna Bersche
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia (slow heart rate)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Implantation of a Pacemaker (UPMCE VDD type single lead)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. Eversyn Anschutz is a 74 yo Anschutz-speaking male with ESRD
on HD, h/o mild CAD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diastolic
dysfunction, who presented to hemodialysis today and was found
to be bradycardic. He completed hemodialysis without any
complications and had 2.5L of fluid removed.  He had a heart
rate of ~38 (35-40 per report) and was asymptomatic. He denied
having any 123 Any St.us episodes of bradycardia. He denied any chest
pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, leg swelling,
lighheadedness, diziness, nausea, or vomiting. He was sent to
the emergency room for further evaluation.
.
In the ER his VS were T98.7F, BP 189/81mmHg, HR 40, RR 24, SpO2
97% RA. His physical exam was normal; orthostasis, valsalva were
not done. He received aspirin 81 mg. Hct was at his baseline of
35, cardiac enzymes were CK: 103, MB: 7 and Trop-T: 0.27.
Cardiology was consulted and suggested admission to CCU for
monitoring and possible PPM in AM. Prior to transfer to CCU: HR
34, BPM 190/80 mmHg, SpO2 99% RA, RR 18.
.
He has had one hospital admission (2011-08-12 00:00:00) for bradycardia in the
past in the setting of severe hyperkalemia (K=8.9).  At that
time he was treated with atropine and ended up with a
wide-complex tachycardia requiring intubation and pressors.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Eversyn Anschutz is a 74 yo Anschutz-speaking male with h/o
ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and mild CAD who presented with
asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement.

# Bradycardia - Patient presented with bradycardia consistent
with 2nd degree AV block.  His heart rates were in the 30's-40's
at this time.  He received a UPMCE single-lead pacemaker.
He had difficult access for the pacemaker, and required multiple
sticks on the right side.  He ended up having it placed via
axillary access on the right side, with some bleeding during the
procedure.  His pacemaker was in the correct place via follow-up
CXR and an interrogation the morning after the procedure showed
a normally functioning pacemaker.  He had one episode of chest
pain after an attempt at pacemaker insertion that was associated
with no ECG changes and no elevation in cardiac enzymes.  This
pain was not thought to be cardiac-related.

# Hypertension - Patient with persistent hypertension while in
the CCU.  His BP was highest post-dialysis, as he does not take
his medications the morning before dialysis.  We increased his
dose of clonidine 0.2mg po daily to 0.2mg po bid.  We continued
his lisinopril, diovan, amlodipine, and HCTZ.  His BP stabilized
by the time of discharge on these medications, although he would
likely benefit from outpatient BP monitoring.

# CAD -  Patient with history of coronary artery disease (last
cath 2011-08-12 00:00:00 showed 50% lesion of ramus intermedius)who presented
with asymptomatic bradycardia.  It was felt that his bradycardia
was unlikely to be related to current ischemia, and patient's
ECG was not suggestive of ischemia or infarct.  He was continued
on aspirin 81mg po daily and he was started on simvastatin 40mg
po daily.

# Pump - Last echo in 2011-08-12 00:00:00 showed mildly depressed systolic
function, with LVEF = 55% and inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis.  It was felt that his pump would benefit most from
optimal blood pressure control.

# Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed MWF
while in house, and has follow-up with dialysis clinic.  His
electrolytes were monitored and repleted, and calcium acetate
and nephrocaps were continued.  Aspirin 81mg po daily was also
continued.

# Peripheral 2011-08-12 00:00:00 Disease - patient with significant
peripheral 2011-08-12 00:00:00 disease and recently seen by 2011-08-12 00:00:00 here
at UPMCE.  He missed an appointment for arterial studies
(noninvasive) which he was an inpatient, and it was attempted to
get these studies as an inpatient but they were not completed
before discharge.  The studies were ordered again as an
outpatient.

Asthma/COPD -  Patient with long-standing asthma and COPD with
wheezing at baseline.
He presented with diffuse wheezing that improved with his home
medications and albuterol.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to a slow heart rate
(bradycardia).  You were given a pacemaker (UPMCE VDD) in
order to speed up your heart rate.  You will need to keep the
dressing over the pacer clean and dry for one week until you go
to the device clinic. You should wear a sling for 24 hours after
your pacemaker placement.  You cannot shower but may take a bath
as long as the
dressing stays dry. You cannot lift your right arm over your
head for 6 weeks, no swimming or tennis. No carrying more than 5
pounds for 6 weeks with your right arm. Please see the discharge
instructions regarding pacemakers that was given to you at
discharge.

Please call Dr. Anschutz if you notice any increasing swelling,
bruising, bleeding or increasing pain at the pacer site. If the
pacer site is sore, you can take Tylenol. Also call Dr. Anschutz
for fevers, chills, dizziness, chest pain or trouble breathing.

You were started on simvastatin 40mg by mouth daily to help
lower your cholesterol and prevent your risk of heart attacks in
the future.  In addition, your dose of clonidine was doubled
because your blood pressure was high during your hospital stay.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up at your dialysis clinic on Anschutz, 2011-08-12 00:00:00 as [** Location **]usly scheduled.  Your dialysis clinic should draw
a vancomycin level AFTER dialysis and should give you one dose
of vancomycin if your level is low.  After that, you will not
need any more vancomycin.

Please schedule an appointment with the cardiology device clinic
(test@mail.com) in 1 week.  This clinic will help make sure your
pacemaker is working correctly.

Please schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor,
Dr. Anschutz in the next 2 weeks.  The phone number is
test@mail.com.
