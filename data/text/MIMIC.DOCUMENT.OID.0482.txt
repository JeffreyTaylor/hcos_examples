Pertinent Results:
2010-12-28 00:00:00 ECHO
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is critical aortic
valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Drs. Kimblery Cmiel and Kimblery Cmiel notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine, epi. AV pacing.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position with
trivial central AI, no paravalvular leak. The aortic gradient is
now 11 mmHg. LVEF = 70% on inotropic support. MR remains 1+. The
aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. Panuco was admitted to the UPMCE on 2010-12-28 00:00:00 for surgical
management of her coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.
She was taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to one vessel and replacement of her
aortic valve with a 21mm 2010-12-28 00:00:00 tissue valve. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next few hours, she
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She was
transfused 2 units of red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
On postoperative day one, she was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. Her
internal pacemaker was interrogated by the electrophysiology
service. She continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to UPMCE Rehab on postoperative day 4. She will
follow-up with Dr. Kimblery Cmiel, her cardiologist, the
electrophysiology service and her primary care physician as
instructed.
