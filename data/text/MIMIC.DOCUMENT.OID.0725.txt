History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 50yo M with PMHx significant for alcohol abuse and
CAD with multiple MI's, prior MI 2010-10-23 00:00:00 with OM stent, and PCI at
UPMCE 2010-10-23 00:00:00 of the proximal RCA and mid-RCA (both Taxus),
LAD stent at UPMCE in 2010-10-23 00:00:00. The patient initially was in the
UPMCE Hospital ED on 2010-10-23 00:00:00 with chest pain. EKG showed  NSR,
nonspecific ST-T changes per report. The paitent left AMA before
further w/u was done. He then presented to UPMCE via
EMS on 2010-10-23 00:00:00 with increase lethergy and jaundice for the last
three days. He was transfeed to UPMCE ED for a GIB and a HCT of
21. He was transfused before transfer with 1 unit.
.
From the medicine admission note:
Pt states he has never had liver problems or h/o jaundice, but
has taken about 14 tylenol over past week for chronic back pain.
Pt reports he was on an alcohol binge while in 123 Any St. one
week ago. Around the time he came back he developed chest pain
and was seen in the UPMCE ED where chest pain resolved
with NG and he was discharged. Pt is very unclear about this -
states that he had an MI but was only given SL NG and was
discharged without admission. UPMCE was contactBarbaa Ammerman and
they currently have no record of EKGs or other records
indicating that pt was seen one week ago - at last communication
with RN in ED of UPMCE, it was felt that perphaps visit had not
yet been logged in to computer and will need to contact again
tomorrow. Since that time he developed melena and jaundice. He
denies dizziness or chest pain but in the UPMCE ED he
was found to have elevated LFTs, Hct of 22, received 1u PRBC and
transferred to UPMCE. Here pt refused EGD and NG lavage. In
UPMCE ED received 2u PRBC, octreotide and PPIs as well as KCL
for hypokalemia, N-acetylcysteine for elevated tylenol levels,
and antibiotics for bandemia. RUQ showed gall baldder sludge but
no bilary dilation. He was felt to have no ascites and so was
not tapped. After receiving the two units of PRBC he desaturated
to from 96% to 88% on RA. Received Lasix for volume overload
.
The paitent was then admitted to a medicine team via NF. He
recieved a total of 3 transfusions here and his and his HCT has
only gone up from 22.6 to 25.2. Also, he has having multiple
episodes of melana. He went for an EGD today (2010-10-23 00:00:00) but was not
coorperative despite midazloam 3mg and meperidene 75mg.  He also
started to have hallucinations on the floor. Therefore, he was
tx to the MICU for closer monitoring and intubation for EGD.
.
.
ROS: denies CP, SOP, abd pain. Per wife, he always hs wheezing,
not dx with a lung condition. He has been having increasing
swelling in his left lower leg for the past 6 months.

Past Medical History:
-alcohol abuse - pt reports that he drinks 2-3 beers per day,
denies DTs. no prior history of liver disease
-CAD s/p MI 2010-10-23 00:00:00, stent LAD 2010-10-23 00:00:00, stent mid and prox RCA in 2010-10-23 00:00:00

- Per wife, in 2010-10-23 00:00:00, the patient had a motorcycle accident and
broke his femur and had compartment syndrome leading to a
fasicotomy in the right lower leg. He has had multiple DVT's
since in that leg.
- herniated lumbar disc with sciatica, on chronic pain
medications

Micro:

Radiology:
2010-10-23 00:00:00 RUQ US:  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty
infiltration.  Other forms of liver disease including hepatitis
and severe hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this
examination.  Nondistended gallbladder containing sludge.
Associated mild gallbladder wall edema is a non-specific finding
which can be seen in low albumin states. No definite evidence
for cholecystitis.

2010-10-23 00:00:00 echo: EF 40%, 1. The left atrium is normal in size. The
left atrium is elongated. The right  atrium is markedly dilated.
 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly  depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include basal and mid  inferior and
inferolateral akinesis..  3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation  is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral  regurgitation is seen.  5.Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary  artery
systolic hypertension.  6.There is no pericardial effusion.

2010-10-23 00:00:00 CT abd: 1.  Markedly fatty liver containing a
subcentimeter hypodense lesion that is too small to accurately
characterize.  An additional focus of hyperdensity anteriorly
within segment IV is incompletely characterized, and could
represent a focus of fatty sparing.  6 month follow up CT is
recommended. 2.  No evidence of mesenteric vascular occlusion or
secondary signs of mesenteric ischemia.
3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.

2010-10-23 00:00:00 renal US: The right and left kidneys measure 12.8 and 13.2
cm
respectively without evidence of stones, masses or
hydronephrosis.

2010-10-23 00:00:00 CT torso: 1.  Patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities and
dense bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation,
findings that suggest infectious process superimposed upon
atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions. 2.  Fatty
infiltration of the liver.  Interval increase in intraabdominal
ascites. 3.  No definite evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Two foci of gas within the right lower quadrant are likely
located within decompressed and non-opacified loops of small
bowel.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 50yo man with anemia, GI bleed, liver
insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, bandemia, elevated troponin
with new EKG changes, desaturation consistent with volume
overload, alcohol abuse. Could not tolerate EGD therefore
transferred to the MICU for intubation and EGD.

1.  Blood loss Anemia and GI bleed- Likley 2010-10-23 00:00:00 to GIB, acute on
chronic since he was also anemic on 2010-10-23 00:00:00 at UPMCE. GI
preformed EGD which showed gastropathy and grade I varices, no
active or h/o bleeding.  He was transferred to MICU for
intubation prior to this study. ABdominal CT scan revealed
hyperdensity in the liver and fatty infiltration.  A colonoscopy
showed a non-bleeding small polyp.  He was transfused to keep
his hct>25.  Hematocrit was monitored daily, and hct was kept
>25.

2.  ESLD:  On admission, differential for this was tylenol
toxicity vs. alcoholic hepatitis.  On presentation, he was
jaundiced, had evidence of GI bleeding.  He had reportedly been
on a recent EtOH binge in 123 Any St..  His liver failure was
likely a result of alcoholic hepatitis.  He was initially
treated with N-acetyl cysteine and lipitor was held.  Liver was
consulted and felt that the prognosis was poor.  He was started
on pentoxyfylline without much improvement.  This was ultimately
discontinued for ineffectiveness.  RUQ US showed GB wall edema
with sludge, no biliary obstruction, no ascites, some fatty
infiltration of the liver.  CT scan (no contrast) of the abdomen
showed ascites with an enlarged liver, with evidence of fatty
infiltration.  Hepatitis serologies were negative for infection
(Hep A, B, C).  Bilirubin improved slightly with these
supportive measures, but this still remained very elevated.  INR
was 2010-10-23 00:00:00, with some improvement to vitamin K.  Albumin was in the
2's as well.  After 5-6 weeks of supportive care, liver team
felt that possibility of improvement was remote. After
discussion with family, patient was made CMO and transferred
home for hospice care.

3.  Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated
semi-electively for EGD, performed in MICU.  This was difficult
to wean post-procedure.  The reasons for this were thought to be
neuromuscular weakness, PNA.  He was ultimately trached (after
failing extubation).  He was weaned from pressure support to
trach mask, with adequate saturation on this.  This was
continued upon transfer home to hospice.

4.  Encephalopathy:  Patient had altered MS that was likely
multifactorial.  Neurology was consulted and felt that this was
likely secondary to a toxic-metabolic cause.  EEG was done;
results were non-specific.  LP was deferred given low likelihood
for infectious etiology.  MRI of the brain was performed and was
negative for any focal lesion, enhancement, or other
abnormality.  Mental status cleared; confusion was likely a
result of hepatic and uremic encephalopathy.

5.  ID:  Although initially afebrile on admission, he developed
a WBC count and fever, bandemia.  Ascites was tapped and was
negative for signs of infection/SBP.  CXR was suspicious for
blossoming pneumonia.  After intubation, he was treated for VAP
with 7 days of imipenem with subsequent Vancomycin therapy for
MRSA in his sputum.  All blood/urine cultures remained negative.
 The only significant culture data was +MRSA in his sputum.  He
remained febrile with a leukocytosis, however; he did remain
hemodynamically stable.  He completed 13 days of vancomycin
therapy before he was made CMO.

6.  CAD: On 2010-10-23 00:00:00, he went to an outside hospital with chest
pain, had an EKG with "nonspecific ST-T changes", and once his
pain resolved he left the ED AMA. Cardiology evaluated him and
thought his current changes in the inferior lead was demand
ischemia (in the setting of blood loss anemia). He has ruled out
for an MI.  An echocardiogram revealed a markedly dilated right
atrium, 2+tr, moderate pulmonary hypertension, mildly dilated LV
with basal, mid-inferior and inferolateral akinesis with 1+mr
and EF 40%.  His atenolol and aspirin were held while he had a
GI bleed.  Once hemodynamically stable, metoprolol was
restarted.  Patient also developed an atrial tachycardia; rate
was controlled with beta-blocker as above.  ASA was held given
GI bleed.

7.  Hepatorenal syndrome: Creatinine/renal function was normal
on admission but then dramatically rose to 3-4 as liver function
worsened.  This was most likely due to hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal was consulted and recommended starting Octreotide and
midodrine.  In addition, CVVHD was initiated to manage volume
and electrolyte status.  This was discontinued upon transition
to CMO care.

8.  Alcohol detox: He was initially actively withdrawing from
alcohol on admission, with visual hallucinations.  He was
managed with benzodiazepines as necessary and transitioned to a
versed drip in the MICU.

9.  Disposition: After a prolonged course in the MICU without
apparent improvment in liver or kidney function, patient was
made CMO.  This decision was discussed with the patient, his
family, and various subspecialists involved in his care.  He was
discharged home with hospice level care, as per patient and
family's wishes.
