Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo f with hx of DMII, OSA, admitted with ARF, hypoglycemia,
and hyperkalemia who developed AMS and hypoxia in the setting of
being asleep without her CPAP, receiving high dose oxycontin and
possibly aspirating emesis.  She recovered after one night in
the MICU and was discharged in stable condition.
.
#Respiratory Distress: Hypoxia and hypercarbia was due to her
severe OSA.  She fell asleep without her CPAP in the setting of
not sleeping overnight and recieved oxycontin for her
neuropathic pain.  This was complicated by an likely aspiration
pneumonitis seen on her CXR and CT scan (RUL ground glass
opacities).  She recovered after one night in the MICU and was
transferred to the floor.  Prior to transfer, she spiked a
temperature and was placed on Ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  She
was in stable condition at the time of discharged.
.
# ARF: Unclear cause of renal failure.  Her urine lytes showed
FeNa 1.2% and FeUrea 37%. UA was negative. BUN was also
elevated.  Patient may be dehydrated in setting of diuretic
medications and possible type IV RTA given DM history.
Hyperkalemia was attributed to a combination of medications and
renal failure.  This resolved after patient was given IVF,
holding her home medications.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Initial EKG was notable for tall T waves (though
seen in prior from 2008-03-07 00:00:00), normal QTC, low voltage.  Due to ACE
and spironolactone use in the setting of acute renal failure.
Resolved after restricting medications, IVF, and potassium
restrict diet.  There was a question this may be due to other
hypoaldosterone states. She will follow up with endocrine clinic
as an outpatient for further work up.
.
# Hypoglycemia/DMII: Patient noted to have recently switched for
insulin to metformin. She also started a diet and exercise
routine.  Limerick was consulted on management of DM.  She was
placed on a ISS in house and metformin was held.  This continued
at the time of her discharge. She will follow up with Limerick and
endocrine as an outpatient.

deficient in B12 or folate.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you in UPMCE.
.
You came to the hospital with high potassium, renal failure, and
low glucose.  We provided fluid hydration and restricted your
diet to low potassium diet.  We also stopped a couple of your
medications that may have caused you to have elevated potassium.
 Your glucose levels were evaluated and we had Limerick Diabetes
Clinic doctors Issiac Limerick Issiac Limerick.  You were placed on an insulin sliding
scale while you were in the hospital.  During your
hospitalization, you had an episode where you did not put on
your face mask and your oxygen saturation levels dropped. In
this state, you vomited and aspirated, as the result, you had an
aspiration pneumonia.  You stayed in the intensive care unit for
one night.  You recovered and you were then placed on
antibiotics for the aspiration pneumonia. Your followup chest
xray did not show a pneumonia, so you were not continued on
antibiotics. The chest findings were likely due to solely
aspiration.
.
You also had some abnormal thyroid lab studies which should be
worked up further as an outpatient. In addition, an endocrine
follow-up is also being set-up so that you can be tested for
high cortisol levels.
.
It is very important that you start to use your CPAP machine
during any naps that you take during the day as well as when
sleeping at night.
.
Please follow up with your upcoming doctor's appointments which
have been made for you below.
.
