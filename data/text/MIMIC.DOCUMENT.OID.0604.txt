associated crowding of the cervicomedullary junction, which
demonstrates a kinked appearance.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 2014-07-19 00:00:00
Status post decompression for Chiari malformation with occipital

craniectomy and C1 posterior arch resection without evidence of
hemorrhage.

MRI 2014-07-19 00:00:00: IMPRESSION: Expected postoperative appearance status
post Chiari I decompression surgery. No evidence of hemorrhage
or infarction. The dural venous sinuses remain patent. The major
intracranial flow voids are
preserved.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted electively through SDA for decompressive
craniectomy for Chiari Malformation.  Pt underwent the procedure
and awoke from anesthesia without difficulty.  She was extubated
and fully recovered in the ICU. She was placed in a hard aspen
collar and should continue to wear it for 2 week post
operatively. Post op check, patient reported neck pain and was
placed on a morphine PCA. CT head showed multiple foci of
pneumocephalus, but no acute hemorrhage. On 2014-07-19 00:00:00, patient was
nonfocal on examination except for neck pain with movement. The
PCA was discontinued and foley removed. She was encouraged to be
OOB and was transferred to the floor. MRI head was done which
showed post op changes. On 2014-07-19 00:00:00, patient reported pain in the
base of the neck. PT was consulted and patient's medications
were adjusted. She was cleared for discharge from PT. On 2014-07-19 00:00:00
the patient continued to have significant discomfort in her
neck. Medications were adjusted. Her foley was discontinued but
she had post void urinary retention x2. This was treated with
straight catheterizations. A u/a was checked and negative.
On 2014-07-19 00:00:00 the patient's pain was more controlled and she was
voiding without difficulty. She was cleared for discharge home
at that time.
