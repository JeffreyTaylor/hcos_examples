2012-08-20 00:00:00 MRI/A Head Pre-op:

1. Midline posterior fossa extra-axial mass consistent with
meningioma
measuring 2.2 x 1.2 cm with indentation on the adjacent
cerebellum.
2. Cerebellar tonsils are 5 mm below the level of foramen magnum
which appear to be a secondary effect of compression of the
cerebellum by the meningioma described above.
3. Tortuous vertebrobasilar system with deformity of the left
seventh and
eighth nerves as well as left trigeminal nerve by tortuous left
vertebral and basilar arteries.
4. Soft tissue changes within the left middle ear and mastoid
antrum.
Clinical correlation recommended for further evaluation. CT of
the temporal bone can help for further assessment if clinically
indicated.

MRA HEAD:

The head MRA demonstrates tortuous left vertebral artery as well
as the
basilar artery which extends to the left cerebellopontine angle
in position to deform the left seventh and eighth nerves as well
as the left trigeminal nerve. There is no vascular occlusion or
stenosis seen.

IMPRESSION: Somewhat tortuous left vertebral and basilar
arteries as
described above. No vascular occlusion or stenosis is seen.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 CTH Post op:

Status post resection of posterior fossa mass. Appropriate
post-surgical changes are seen, with no evidence of acute
hemorrhage. There is mild effacement of the quadrigeminal
cistern and a slight fullness to the foramen magnum, also
secondary to surgery. No large vascular territorial infarct is
seen.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Status post placement of a right-sided
ventriculostomy tube, with interval improvement of lateral and
third ventriculomegaly. There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage or large vascular territorial infarct seen.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased cerebral edema, with effacement of sulci and
basilar cisterns, may be reactive.
2. Effacement of the fourth ventricle and increased size of
lateral and third ventricle, concerning for current or impending
obstructive hydrocephalus.
3. Increased fullness of foramen magnum in the setting of known
type 1
Chike Cherf-Chiari malformation, concerning for herniation. Recommend
MRI to
better evaluate these changes.

2012-08-20 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Stable ventriculomegaly. Stable basilar cistern and
fourth
ventricle effacement, non-patent fourth ventricle. No acute
intracranial
hemorrhage or infarct since prior study.

2012-08-20 00:00:00:
CT Head: Interval removal of the right frontal ventriculostomy
catheter w/o change in lateral ventricular size. Tiny amount of
hyperdense blood products along the catheter tract. Slightly
decreased effacement of the 4th ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
2012-08-20 00:00:00 Pt admitted to neurosurgery service and underwent a
suboccipital craniotomy for resection of meningioma. During the
surgery pt did have aproximately 750cc of blood loss for which
she was given PRBC intra operatively. Pt HCT remained stable
post operatively and had no signs of continued bleeding. Post
operatively pt was transfered to the PACU which she stayed over
night. She remained on a nipride IV gtt to constrol SBP<140. Her
physical exam post operatively remained unchanged and was AOx3,
moving all extremities and had no neurological defecit. A post
operative head ct showed no acute bleed or infarct.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 Pt was seen  on morning rounds and still found to be
somewhat hypertensive with SBP in the 170's. The pt was
transfered to the ICU and her nipride IV gtt was increased for
further blood pressure control. The pt also remained on q1 neuro
checks to monitor her neurological status.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 On physical exam, pt was found to be more lethargic and
uncooperative with exam and limited following of commands. A
stat head ct showed enlarged lateral ventricles and the presence
of temporal horns. Pt was given 10mg of decadron IV, Mannitol
50g IV and placed on a standing dose of mannitol 25g q6. Serum
Na and Osm were monitored q6 and held for values >150 and 320
respectively.
  Pt became increasingly somnolent and was taken to the O.R for
placement of a R frontal 2012-08-20 00:00:00. She tolerated this procedure well
with no complications. Post operatively 2012-08-20 00:00:00 was placed at 10cm
above the tragus. Post Crispin Scarpelli, pt was more awake and alert and back
to her baseline.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 2012-08-20 00:00:00 was effectively weaned over the weekend as her ICP
remained less than 20 when her drained was clamped. Her exam
continued to improve and she was more alert, responsive and
interactive. A head ct revealed decrease ventricular size and
good placement of 2012-08-20 00:00:00.

2012-08-20 00:00:00 Pt Crispin Scarpelli was removed with issue. She was transfered to the
floor in stable condition. A head ct was obtained 6 hours after
Crispin Scarpelli removed and demonstrated normal sized ventricles and no
acute hemorrhage.

She was transferred to the floor.  On the morning on 2012-08-20 00:00:00 she
was ambulating independently and had good pain control.  She was
neurologically intact.  She was discharged to home on 2012-08-20 00:00:00
without services.
