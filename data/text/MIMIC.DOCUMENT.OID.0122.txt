ADDENDUM TO 2012-12-21 00:00:00 DISCHARGE SUMMARY - SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL
COURSE FOLLOWING MICU CALL OUT:  In summary, this is a
73-year-old male, with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
cord compression, depression, BPH, who was transferred to
UPMCE for sepsis and respiratory failure, treated in the ICU,
and called out to the floor with resolving respiratory
failure, sepsis, with a presumed pneumonia.  Please see above
dictation for ICU course.

1) SEPSIS:  The patient was called out from the MICU with
resolving sepsis.  He remained hemodynamically stable on the
floor.  The patient finished his 7-day course of
hydrocortisone, was continued on Levofloxacin IV with
transition to PO, and continued on vancomycin.  Sepsis was
presumed to be due to underlying pneumonia, as evidenced by
chest x-ray, though no organisms was ultimately identified in
either the blood, sputum, or urine.  Prior PICC line site
catheter tip was also negative.

2) PNEUMONIA:  The patient was treated for bilateral
interstitial fluffy infiltrates on chest x-ray.  Differential
diagnosis including atypicals and PCP.  Fazal Fleeger patient improved
clinically on broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, and
subsequently continued on Levaquin and vancomycin.  There was
some initial suggestion that the chest x-ray looked
consistent with PCP, Fazal Fleeger the patient had been on long-term
steroids for cord compression.  However, the patient
clinically improved without bactrim, or treatment for his
Pneumocystis carinii, for suspected PCP Fazal Fleeger.  The
patient will be discharged on a 7-day course of Levofloxacin
500 mg po qd, and vancomycin 1 gm IV q 12 h x 7 days.  The
patient will be discharged on prophylactic dose of bactrim,
as the patient will continue decadron 4 mg po qd for cord
compression and for continued treatment of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.  On discharge, the patient was breathing
comfortably on room air with resolved respiratory failure.

3) TYPE 2 DIABETES, INSULIN DEPENDENT:  The patient's blood
sugars were relatively uncontrolled during his hospital stay,
as the patient was given IV steroids as part of the sepsis
protocol.  The patient's Lantus dose was increased to 20 U q
hs with an aggressive Humalog sliding scale, and on the day
of discharge blood sugars remained in the 150s-250 range.
The patient will need careful follow-up as high-dose steroids
will be discontinued on the day of discharge, with assessment
of blood sugar and need to titrate down on the Lantus and
Humalog as needed.

4) NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA:  The patient will be continued to
be followed at UPMCE by Dr. Hanen Pasman for continued
management of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The patient will
be discharged on decadron 4 mg po qd.

5) ANEMIA:  The patient was transfused 2 units for acute
blood loss in the ICU.  The patient's hematocrit remained
greater than 30.  On discharge, the patient will continue his
Epogen 4,000 units twice a week for persistent and chronic
anemia.

6) DEPRESSION:  The patient's affect was relatively flat with
some evidence of paranoia.  He will continue on his
citalopram 20 mg po qd with follow-up with his primary care
physician for further management.

7) DECONDITIONING:  The patient has a long history of
rehabilitation, inactivity and loss of function secondary to
cord compression.  Cord compression has improved per
information from his prior extended care facility.  He will
need aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy at
his new extended care facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient is breathing
comfortably on room air, attempting ambulation with
assistance, and tolerating PO.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is expected to be discharged
to the UPMCE acute care facility for rehabilitation, with
transfer to lower level care as needed.
