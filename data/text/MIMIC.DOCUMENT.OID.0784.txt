HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 29-year-old
female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, who was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the
Emergency Department with sepsis.  The patient was in her
usual state of health until after her usual Monday
hemodialysis session.  The session lasted three hours and was
complicated by line thrombosis.

Upon arriving home, she felt profoundly fatigued, was
vertiginous, and had diffuse long bone pain, felt febrile,
and was nauseated, and vomited once.  She also noted mild
shortness of breath with mild pleuritic chest pain.  The
patient took Tylenol with no relief.

On the morning of 2009-03-14 00:00:00, she presented to the
Emergency Department and was found to have a blood pressure
of 90/60, which was responsive to 1 liter of normal saline.
The patient had generalized weakness and mild abdominal pain.
A left external jugular central line was attempted, but
became infiltrated and was removed with resulting hematoma.
A successful right femoral line was then placed.  Her
temperature was 101 with a white blood cell count of 35.8.
She was transiently hypoxic briefly requiring a face mask to
sustain an oxygen saturation of greater than 90%.  She was
also found to have a potassium of 9.2.  She was given insulin
D50, calcium gluconate, and bicarbonate.  An EKG showed
peaked T waves with widening of the QRS intervals.  Patient
was taken for hemodialysis during which time blood cultures
were drawn and Vancomycin was given empirically.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Diarrhea.  Patient traveled to 123 Any St.,
nausea, weakness, mild headache, mild photophobia.  Patient
has gained 30 pounds and lost 30 pounds over the past year.
Patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, dysuria, neck
stiffness, abdominal pain, sick contacts, vision changes, and
leg pain.

with a few retrograde P waves versus third degree block with
ventricular escape.  There is a wide QRS with marked T waves,
increase.

Patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further workup.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Bacteremia:  Blood cultures from 2009-03-14 00:00:00 were 2009-03-14 00:00:00
positive for Staphylococcus aureus.  Patient was continued on
Vancomycin until speciation and specificities were obtained.
On 2009-03-14 00:00:00, Staphylococcus aureus was found to be
methicillin sensitive.  Therefore, the patient was switched
to oxacillin, and maintained on oxacillin throughout her
hospital stay.

Her Permacath was removed on 2009-03-14 00:00:00, and the tip was
sent for culture, which came back positive for
methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus.  Blood cultures were
obtained daily until 2009-03-14 00:00:00.  Blood cultures from
2009-03-14 00:00:00 showed 1/4 bottles positive for Staphylococcus
aureus.  Blood cultures from the 5th and onward were negative
for any bacterial growth.

The patient underwent transthoracic echocardiogram to rule
out endocarditis, which was negative.  The patient then
underwent transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out
endocarditis.  This too showed no valvular vegetations.  The
patient defervesced, and blood pressure responded immediately
to fluid resuscitation.  The patient will be discharged on a
course of total of 14 days of oxacillin from the first
negative blood cultures.

2. Access:  The patient's Permacath was removed as well as
her femoral catheter that was placed in the Emergency
Department.  It was thought that the patient should be left
without any access for several days so that her bacteremia
was cleared.  Patient was dialyzed intermittently with a
femoral catheter, which was then removed after dialysis.

On 2009-03-14 00:00:00, the patient had negative blood cultures for
four days.  Therefore, she went to the OR for tunneled
Permacath for dialysis.  In addition, a PICC line was placed
for continued oxacillin as an outpatient.  The patient
tolerated these procedures well.

3. End-stage renal disease:  Patient was dialyzed as needed
in-house.  Her initial hyperkalemia on presentation responded
well to Kayexalate with resolution of her EKG changes.  The
patient was continued on Renagel and amphojel.  She continued
to have hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with some
hyponatremia that was all thought to be due to her end-stage
renal disease and that was resolved with dialysis.  PTH was
obtained, which was 1,055.

4. Left neck hematoma:  The patient was noted to have a large
hematoma at the site of the external jugular venous attempt
and thrombosis.  This increased in size during her hospital
stay.  Therefore, the patient underwent repeated ultrasound
evaluation to ensure that there was no compromise of the
vessels in that area.  Ultrasounds were negative for any
obstruction of flow in the vessels, and did show a large
hematoma.  Patient also underwent CT of the neck which showed
a large hematoma with no compromise of vessels.  The hematoma
began to reabsorb.  The patient's pain was treated with
oxycodone and OxyContin, and was resolving by the time of
discharge.

5. Patient initially complained of diarrhea and abdominal
pain.  She had three Clostridium difficile toxins, which were
negative.  Her diarrhea resolved without any treatment.

6. Psychiatry:  The patient was maintained on Zoloft and
Seroquel.

7. Hypertension:  The patient had elevated blood pressures on
days when she was not dialyzed up to 160/110.  Patient was
maintained on her outpatient regimen of atenolol and Zestril.
