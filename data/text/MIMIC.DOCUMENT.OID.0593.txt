Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, hypotension, hypoxia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT-guided drainage of left gluteal abscess (2005-11-20 00:00:00).


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. 123 Any St.
2005-11-20 00:00:00 anterior spinal artery infarct, indwelling suprapubic
catheter with frequent UTIs admitted with altered mental status
and hypoxia.  Per nursing facility notes, the patient was noted
to be unresponsive to voice commands but responsive to tactile
stimuli.  Vitals at the time were BP 100/50, HR 100, RR 20, O2
80% on RA which increased to 97% on 6 L NC.  Reportedly, she is
alert & oriented X 3 at her baseline.  Of note, she is currently
on nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for a UTI (? culture result)
which she started on 2005-11-20 00:00:00 for a planned 10 day course.  She
apparently also complained of nausea and may have vomited so
lactulose was held today.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T 102.1, HR 100, BP
132/56, RR 24, 97% on 15 L via nasal cannula.  Blood pressure
trended down to 80s systolic.  She was originally on peripheral
dopamine for BP improvement but as this was not effective, it
was changed to peripheral levophed with subsequent improvement
in blood pressures to 120s systolic.  Blood and urine cultures
were sent.  She was treated with PR tylenol, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV X 1, vancomycin 1 g IV X 1, and 1 g ceftriaxone X 1.  She
received a total of 6 L NS in the ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient denies any pain.  She is
alert and speaking a few words at a time though they are
difficult to interpret.  She specifically denies any shortness
of breath or any abdominal pain.

Studies
.
Chest x-ray (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
There is bilateral atelectasis. There is no evidence of focal
consolidation that would be indicative of pneumonia.  There is
no evidence of congestive heart failure. The mediastinal and
cardiac contours are stable. There is again evidence of
post-surgical changes. There is no pleural effusion and no
evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are
stable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2005-11-20 00:00:00,
the findings are similar.
.
CT head without contrast (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Fluid in the right maxillary sinus, which may indicate acute
sinusitis.
.
MR pelvis (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
IMPRESSION:
1. Large sacral/coccygeal decubitus ulcer extending up to the
inferior
sacrum. Abnormal signal involves both sides of the inferior
sacrum, likely
from a combination of osteomyelitis. Te possibility of a
superimposed
nondisplaced left sacral alar insufficiency fracture cannot be
excluded.
2. 2.6- cm rim-enhancing high T2 structure in the left gluteal
soft tissues lateral to and apparently communicating with the
ulcer tract -- ? abcess collection vs packing material in recess
of ulcer. Please see comment above.
3. Stable appearance of the ulcer tracts extending up to the
ischial
tuberosities bilaterally with abnormal signal and enhancement
about the
posterior aspect of the ischial tuberosities, consistent with
osteomyelitis.
4. Old left intertrochanteric fracture only partially imaged on
today's
study.
5. Prominent sacral Tarlov's cysts.
6. Suprapubic catheter seen approaching the bladder; it is
difficult on the images performed today to determine if the
balloon and tip are in fact within the bladder lumen. Clinical
correlation is therefore requested -- is this tube draining
urine?.
7. Distended large bowel most consistent with ileus.
.
MR brain (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
1. Unchanged bilateral white matter foci of hyperintensities on
T2-weighted and FLAIR images may correspond to chronic
microvascular ischemia.
2. No evidence of acute infarction, masses, or other lesions.
3. Limited MRA evaluation of the brain due to a significant
image degradation from motion artifact demonstrates no
identifiable stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm in the visualized
vessels. The MCAs and the left vertebral artery are poorly
visualized.
.
EEG (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states. There is no evidence of focal slowing or epileptiform
discharges.
.
CT-guided drainage of left gluteal abscess (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
1. Successful CT-guided aspiration of approximately 1 cc of
bloody pus from the left parasacral/left gluteal collection.
2. Sclerosis of both ischial tuberosities, highly suggestive of
osteomyelitis.
3. Persistent left intertrochanteric fracture.
.
Chest x-ray PA and lateral (2005-11-20 00:00:00)
There are multiple healed rib fractures from prior thoracotomy
on the left, with residual osseous deformity. Right PICC
terminates in the superior vena cava. There is bibasilar
atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: No ap123 Any St.ble change from the prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 72 year-old woman with past medical history notable for
para123 Any St. secondary to spinal artery infarct, COPD, and
indwelling suprapubic catheter admitted with mental status
change, fever, and leukocytosis.
.
1. Septic shock.
She presented with low blood pressure, elevated white count,
fever, and mental status change.  She was bolused with 6L normal
saline in the ED and started on dopamine.  When she arrived to
the ICU levophed was running peripherally with systolic blood
pressures in the 130s. This was quickly weaned off and her
systolic BP stablized in the 90-110s.
   Overnight, she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for
empiric coverage of sepsis from UTI versus other source, such as
large stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer.  A blood culture from
this first hospital day later grew out methicillin resistent
staph aureus.  A urine culture grew out Aldene Denson but no
significant bacteria.  Thus the vancomycin was continued and
cefepime discontinued on hospital day 3.  Her suprapubic
catheter was changed in the ICU.
   Infectious disease was consulted for treatment
recommendations.  They agreed that sacral decubitus ulcer was
the likely source for bacteremia and recommended MR Aldene Denson
for sacral osteomyelitis as well as TTE to Denson for valvular
vegetations.  Blood cultures were followed serially.  The
echocardiogram, as above, was negative for endocarditis.  Three
subsequent blood cultures grew out MRSA; the last was on 2005-11-20 00:00:00.
Vancomycin was continued.  Surveillance cultures were followed
through 2005-11-20 00:00:00 and all returned negative.  Once therapeutic on
vancomycin, she defervesced and her white count returned to
123 Any St..
   She will need to complete a six-week course of vancomycin
(last day will be 2005-11-20 00:00:00) for treatment of osteomyelitis.
A right PICC line has been placed for this purpose.
.
2. Altered mental status.
On admission, she was minimally interactive, somnolent, and
disoriented.  Overnight in the ICU, her mental status improved
such that she was talking and interactive, with improved speech,
following commands and oriented x3 by the first hospital day.
This is how she appeared when she was transferred to the
medicine floor. It was believed at the time that her altered
mental status was due to fever and infection.
   However, when she did not make significant improvement over
the first weekend, neurology was consulted.  Per their note, the
altered mental status was likely secondary to toxic/metabolic
encephalopathy in the context of infection.  However, they
recommended MR Aldene Denson for stroke and consideration of
lumbar puncture.  MR brain showed no acute abnormalities.  Her
mental status continued to improved during the week, although
she still has periods of waxing and Dennae Fogelsong alertness.  Her
oxygen sats have been fine on RA, CXR was negative for
infiltrate, and MR as above was negative.
.
3. Urinary tract infection / leakage around suprapubic catheter.
Her first urine culture grew out >100,000 colonies of Aldene Denson.
She had been started on fluconazole in the unit and her
suprapubic catheter changed.  However, given that she was not
symptomatic, infectious disease offered that she did not need to
continue the fluconazole.
   She was noted to have leakage around her suprapubic catheter.
 Aldene Denson was called and instructed us to restart her oxybutynin
which had been stopped for concern of mental status change.  She
has follow-up planned in Aldene Denson clinic as outlined in discharge
instructions.
.
4. Sacral decubitus ulcer and ischial ulcers.
She presented with a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer and two
stage III ulcers over the ischial tuberosities.  Plastics,
consulted in the ED, recommended wet-to-dry dressing changes
three times daily, with frequent turning and kinair bed.
Patient was started on zinc/vitamin c/mvi and nutritional
supplements to ensure adequate wound healing.
   As above, MR sacral spine was ordered to Aldene Denson for
osteomyelitis.  This showed a small fluid collection in the left
gluteal soft tissue concerning for abscess.  Interventional
radiology drained this abscess percutaneously under CT-guidance.
 One cc of bloody pustular fluid was drained that later grew out
MRSA.  She will continue IV vancomycin as above for a total six
week course.  Dressing changes should continue as outlined in
the discharge orders.
.
5. Hypoxia.
Initially she required oxygen in the ED and overnight in the
ICU.  Chest x-ray showed volume overload but no infiltrate.
With treatment of her infection her oxygen requirements
gradually improved.  We continued her home COPD regimen of
inhaled steroids and bronchodilators, and her oxygen saturation
steadily improved.
.
6. Fungal infections.
We treated superficial fungal infections under the breast and in
the groin with miconazole powder.
.
7. Para123 Any St. s/p spinal artery infarct.
We continued her outpatient baclofen.
.
8. Abdominal distension/nausea.
This improved overnight in the ICU and was no longer a problem
at time of transfer to the floors.  LFTs were within normal
limits.
.
9. Osteoporosis.
We continued her outpatient calcium, vitamin D, and fosamax.
.
Her diet was progressed to normal diet with ensure supplements.
She was kept on subcutaneous heparin for venous thrombosis
prophylaxis.  Her code status is DNR/DNI.
