Service:  UPMCE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year-old female
with a history of CREST, diverticular disease, irritable
bowel syndrome, and prior upper GI bleed in 2007-07-07 00:00:00 secondary to
AVM and gastritis.  Her 123 Any St.us UGIB required
hospitalization, which was notable for a hematocrit of 16 on
during stay, 2 units of fresh frozen platelets,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing gastritis and normal
duodenum, cauterization of a gastric AVM, and angiography
followed by embolization of left gastric artery.

She presented to the Emergency Room at this time with a chief
complaint of two days of dark stools, left lower abdominal
breath, lightheadedness, fevers or chills, and night sweats.
No bright red blood per rectum, no hematemesis.  In the
Emergency Room she was found to be in no acute distress and
with a temperature of 99.5, blood pressure 143/53, pulse 86,
respirations 16, 98% on room air.  Nasogastric suction
revealed 200 cc of coffee grounds and lavage with 250 cc H20
showed coffee grounds and a bright red tinge, but lavage was
stopped, because of patient discomfort.  Central line in
femoral vein was placed and she was given one liter of normal
saline.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Gastrointestinal:  The patient presented
with an upper gastrointestinal bleed with a hematocrit of
29.9, melena left lower quadrant pain and coffee grounds with
red tinge on nasogastric lavage.  To look for a source of
bleed, several procedures were done.  An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on 2007-07-07 00:00:00, which showed
diffuse gastritis and a normal duodenum consistent with what
was seen during admission a year before.  On 2007-07-07 00:00:00, enteroscopy
showed improved gastritis and a normal duodenum and jejunum.
Colonoscopy on 2007-07-07 00:00:00 showed retained melena and multiple
nonbleeding diverticula, but no source of bleeding.  A tagged
red cell scan on 2007-07-07 00:00:00 did not identify a source of
gastrointestinal bleeding either.  H-pylori antibody test was
negative.  She was on supportive therapy with Protonix 40 mg
b.i.d. and Carafate, but she had continuous gastrointestinal
bleed as manifested by guaiac positive stools, both melena
and bloody stool and unstable hematocrit throughout most of
her stay.

On the evening of 2007-07-07 00:00:00 (hospital day fifteen), the patient
had a dramatic gastric bleed with a hematocrit drop from 27.7
to 17.4.  The patient became more tachycardic then baseline
to 130s, but maintained her blood pressure.  Nasogastric
lavage at this point revealed bright red blood with clots
that did not clear with 420 cc of H20.  She was transferred
to the MICU where she received 6 units of packed red blood
cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets.  She was taken
to the IR the next morning where the left gastroduodenal
artery was embolized empirically.  By hospital day seventeen,
the patient decided that she wanted no more blood product
transfusions and wanted CMO.

On the evening of hospital day seventeen, the patient was
transferred back to the Medicine Floor with stable hematocrit
of 36.7.  However, one day after the transfer, her hematocrit
dropped to 24.1 with bloody diarrhea.  The patient
reexpressed her wishes for CMO and did not want any more
laboratory tests or any blood product transfusions.

By hospital day twenty the patient appeared stable with
stable tachycardia and blood pressure.  It appeared that
gastrointestinal bleeding either slowed or stopped, so after
discussion between the patient and the family and a
hematocrit check was done, which at the value of 26.4 showed
that she had stopped bleeding.  Two more units of red blood
cells were transfused to increase her hematocrit to at least
greater then 30.

2.  Hematology:  At presentation the patient's hematocrit was
29.9 and was unstable throughout most of the admission.  She
received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells.  Some
hematologic workup was done to look for other causes of
continued bleed, which was negative for GIC, hemolysis and
123 Any St.es) 4452**] disease.  Two of five studies (epinephrine
and arachidonic acid) for platelet aggregation were abnormal
so she was given Desmopressin intravenous times two doses
(2007-07-07 00:00:00 and 2007-07-07 00:00:00) and one bag of platelets, which did not help
stabilize her hematocrit.  A total of 5 units of fresh frozen
platelets were also given, because of multiple red blood
cells could have diluted the concentration of her clotting
factors and less likely, because of the possibility that she
had a coagulopathy given one PTT value.  Hematology/oncology
consult did not feel that the patient had platelet
aggregation abnormalities or a coagulopathy.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's antihypertensive
medications (Atenolol, Aldactone, Lasix) were held during her
hospital stay so that if she were to stop bleeding briskly,
her sympathetic system may respond appropriately to maintain
blood pressure.  Her vital signs remained stable with a blood
pressure in the 140s/80s and heart rate in 80s until hospital
day five when she started having sinus tachycardic 100 to
130s.  At this time she also developed a urinary tract
infection, so the tachycardia was thought to be secondary to
infection or dehydration.  She was given normal saline
intravenous to lower the heart rate to the 110s.  During the
remainder of th hospital course her heart rate remained
elevated in the 100s.  When it rose again to 120 to 130s or
the patient was symptomatic with palpitations, administration
of normal saline intravenous helped control the tachycardia.
After the 123 Any St.itous hematocrit drop on hospital day
fifteen, the patient's cardiac enzymes were checked and they
revealed a mild enzyme leak with CK 118 and 128, MB 8 and 9
and troponin 0.9.  However, full enzyme cycling was not done,
because the patient decided on full CMO measures.  The
patient was also found to have 3 out of 6 systolic murmur
loudest at right upper sternal border, radiating to
subclavian arteries.  Consider outpatient workup with primary
care physician.

4.  Pulmonary:  During the MICU stay, where she was given 6
units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen
platelets she developed dyspnea and bilateral pleural
effusion.  She was given 2 doses of Lasix 20 mg intravenous
after which her dyspnea improved.

5.  Infectious disease:  On hospital day five the patient
spiked a temperature to 101.5.  Urinalysis showed 245 white
blood cells and blood culture was negative.  She was treated
with Levofloxacin 500 mg once a day for eight days.  During
the MICU stay her white blood cells spiked to 19.9, but she
was afebrile and there was no clear source of infection (no
pneumonia on chest x-ray, negative urine culture).  The white
blood cells went down to 12.3 after transfer to the medicine
floor.

6.  Lines:  Access on this patient was difficult to obtain
and maintain.  Access ranged as follows, femoral central
line, peripheral line and left IJ central line by IR.

7.  FEN:  Potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate were
repleted as needed.

8.  Endocrine:  Synthroid was continued for hypothyroidism.

9.  CREST/Sjogren's:  The patient uses Evoxac at home for
Formica, but this was held during hospitalization.  As it is a
cholinergic agonist it could have led to increased gastric
motility and dampen CVA response to hypotension.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient will be discharged
to rehab with clear instructions on how she would like to be
cared for if she were to present with recurrent
gastrointestinal bleed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.  2.
Atenolol 20 mg once a day hold for systolic blood pressure
less then 110, heart rate less then 60.  3.  Synthroid 175
micrograms q.d.  4.  Ativan 0.5 mg po b.i.d.  5.  Darvocet
one tab prn q 6 hours.  6.  MSIR (oral solution) 10 to 30 mg
po prn q 4 hours.  7.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. hold for
diarrhea.  8.  Imodium 2 mg po prn q 6 hours.  9.  Zolpidem 5
mg po prn h.s.  10.  Evoxac 30 mg t.i.d.  11.  Multivitamin
q.d.

FOLLOW UP:  To arrange with Dr. Brain Bruckschen Formica of
gastroenterology and the patient's primary care physician Brain Bruckschen.
Formica.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis.
