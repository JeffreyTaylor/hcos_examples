History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 80 year-old patient with history of Sjogren's
syndrome, moderate MR, recent hospitalization for sepsis
secondary to c. diff colitis complicated by hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring intubation, who is presenting from
UPMCE Rehab with worsening dyspnea for one day.  Patient was
discharged from UPMCE yesterday (2007-04-23 00:00:00) following hospitalization
for c. diff colitis.  Patient had ABG at UPMCE Rehab, which was
7.4/73/63.  Her vitals on transfer were 97.9 99 24 113/68 92%
2L. She reports shortness of breath associated with the cough.
She denies chest pain. She denies nausea or vomiting. She denies
abdominal pain.

In the ED, initial vitals are 100.2 95 99/47 28 100% 4L nc.
Exam was notable for tachypnea with respiratory rates in the
30s.  While in ED, blood pressure dipped to 80s, but improved on
it's own. Given the tachypnea, cough, and dyspnea, there was
concern for pneumonia.  Patient received vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  CXR appeared improved from most recent CXR.
Patiwnt was started on BIPAP.  Patient underwent CTA to evaluate
for PE prior to leaving ED.  On transfer vitals are, HR 93, BP
109/45, O2 sat 100% on BIPAP.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is wearing BiPAP, but wants it
removed and does not want any other supplemental oxygen.  She
denies pain. She denies cough or shortness of breath.

Review of systems:
Unable to obtain, patient wearing BiPAP and is delerious.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old woman, recently hospitalized for C. Difficile sepsis
and shock, re-admitted to MICU from UPMCE Rehab with altered
mental status, tachypnea and a mild respiratory acidosis.

#Hypoxia/hypercarbia: She initially required BiPAP and was
admitted to the MICU for monitoring of her respiratory status.
She was able to be weaned from BiPAP on ICU day 2 and remained
on 2L NC at the time of discharge.  Cause of her respiratory
symptoms is unclear, but may be due to hypoventilation from
somnolence related to oversedation with Zyprexa.  Zyprexa was
held at the time of discharge.  CTA Chest was negative for PE
and showed no clear evidence of pneumonia.  She was initially
started on HCAP antibiotics with vanc/cefepime which were
stopped on HD 4 prior to discharge given that all cultures were
negative and there was no consolidation on imaging.

# Delirium: Likely multifactorial, but thought to be related to
oversedation from Zyprexa.  There was no evidence of infection
and antibiotics were quickly stopped as described above.  UA was
dirty, but UCx was negative x2 (grew only yeast) and she had no
urinary symptoms.  Most of her mental status changes were
probably related to her sedationg medications and hypercarbia at
admission, which improved with BiPAP and holding her
antipsychotics.

# C Diff Colitis: Recently admitted for C. diff colitis with
sepsis. Repeat C Diff PCR was negative during this
hospitalization. She continued to have high volume stool output
and Flexiseal is in place for skin ulceration.  ID was curbsided
regarding vanco course given that she received a few days of
HCAP antibotics and her PO vanco was changed to 125mg q6h for 7
days after stopping IV vanc/cefepime (D7 will be 2007-04-23 00:00:00).
Flexiseal in place at discharge.

# Anemia: Patient with guaiac positive stools this admission,
new from past admission.  Felt to be secondary to sloughing and
mucosal oozing secondary to C diff. Normal lactate on admission
and benign abdominal exam.  Hct has been variable recently, but
fairly stable, although still markedly below her baseline of low
to mid 30s.

# Bilateral pleural effusions: Noted to have bilateral pleural
effusions last hospitalization in setting of massive fluid
resuscitation, right pleural pigtail catheter removed this
admission in the MICU. She is still volume overloaded on exam,
but her bicarb remained elevated, and she was not given any
further diuresis.  The elevated bicarb is also be partially due
to compensation from her respiratory acidosis.

# Volume overload: She has some diastolic dysfunction and has 2+
MR Eaton Ramseyer. She continues to appear total body overloaded, likely
in setting of volume resuscitation on prior admission for
sepsis, but with contraction alkalosis currently, so further
diuresis was held as above.  Consider further diuresis once
hypercarbia improves and bicarb trends down.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily

# Hypertension: Patient was 123 Any St.usly on lisinopril which was
held since last admission in setting of sepsis and relative
hypotension.  She remained normotensive

# GERD: Patient 123 Any St.usly on omeprazole last hospitalization,
which was stopped after C. diff came back positive, and she was
transitioned to H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis but this was
stopped again when she became delirious last hospitalization.
She remains off H2 blocker at discharge because of concern that
it may be contributing to her AMS.

# Code status this admission: FULL

# Transitional issues:
-Foley was removed 2007-04-23 00:00:00 and she has not voided as of discharge,
may need Foley replaced if she is unable to void
-Would restart diuresis when bicarb trends down
-Continue PO vanco 125mg q6h through 2007-04-23 00:00:00
-Please follow Hct daily given melanotic stools, should resolve
as her C. diff resolves
-Midline removed 2007-04-23 00:00:00
-Pigtail catheter removed this admission
-F/u pending BCx, catheter tip cx

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Ramseyer,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to
UPMCE for hypoxia/hypercarbia and altered mental status.  Your
mental status improved once we stopped your Zyprexa and your
breathing improved.  We looked for an infection but were not
able to find a clear source.  You received a few days of
antibiotics while your cultures were pending.  You will continue
PO vanco for an additional 7 days.

The following changes were made to your medications:
CHANGE vancomycin 125mg by mouth every 6 hours for 7 days (last
dose 2007-04-23 00:00:00)
START albuterol neb every 4 hours as needed for SOB/wheezing
START ipratropium neb every 6 hours as needed for SOB/wheezing
STOP Zyprexa

Followup Instructions:
You will have an appointment made with your PCP, Ramseyer. Eaton,
prior to discharge from rehab.
