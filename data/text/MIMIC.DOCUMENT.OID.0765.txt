History of Present Illness:
Mr. Wolk is a 76 year old male with a history of CHF, HTN
and GERD transferred to UPMCE from UPMCE Rehab on 2008-08-11 00:00:00 with
4 days of worsening abdominal distention and feculent vomiting.
He reportedly had not had a bowel movement or passed gas since
2008-08-11 00:00:00.  While being transported to the hospital, he reportedly
had a low oxygen saturation to 80%.  He denied fever, chills,
SOB, or CP.  In the ED, imaging was concerning for large bowel
volvulus, and the patient was admitted to the CSICU under the
acute care service for episodes of desaturation and further
workup of his abdominal symptoms.

Pertinent Results:
2008-08-11 00:00:00- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
1. Severe colonic distention with a transition point in distal
sigmoid colon
concerning for colonic obstruction possibly due to a small
segment of
volvulus. No perforation.
2. Severe bladder distention. Foley placement would be
recommended.
3. NG tube above the GE junction and should be further advanced
for optimal positioning.
4. Chronic changes at the right base may be due to aspiration.

2008-08-11 00:00:00- PATHOLOGY EXAM OF SIGMOID COLON SPECIMEN:
Colonic segment with submucosal edema and vascular congestion;
otherwise within normal limits.
No mucosal ischemic change identified.

2008-08-11 00:00:00- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
1. Massive pneumoperitoneum. Rectal contrast traverses the
sigmoid
anastomotic sutures without evidence of leak, however, the
sutures demonstrate an abnormal, non-circular configuration.
Scattered foci of air are seen surrounding the anastomotic
sutures as well as throughout the small bowel mesentery and in
the paracolic gutters. In the setting of recent anastomosis,
this is concerning for anastomotic leak
2. Dilation of small bowel up to 3.2 cm. There is no clear
transition point, this likely represents ileus.
3. Right basilar consolidation, slightly worse than on the prior
examination with small right pleural effusion. Given location,
aspiration must be considered.
4. The gastric tube loops in the stomach and terminates near the
gastric
cardia. Recommend repositioning before administering tube feeds
or medication via the NG tube given possibility of aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on
2008-08-11 00:00:00 in the setting of four days of increasing abdominal
distention, abdominal pain and emesis.  KUB obtained in the
emergency dept was highly suspicious for sigmoid volvulus.  GI
consult was obtained by ED and sigmoid was detorsed via
decompression by flexible sigmoidoscopy.  Patient was then
admitted to the SICU for observation as he had desaturated to
the 80s while in the ED.  Patient did well overnight in the SICU
and was deemed fit for transfer to the floor on hospital day#2.
Following detorsion, the surgical team had a frank discussion
with the patient indicating the high likelihood of recurrence
for him given the megacolon demonstrated on KUB.  Understanding
this the patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day
3 (2008-08-11 00:00:00) for sigmoid colectomy. Patient tolerated the procedure
well and was admitted to the floor (CC6).

Neuro: Prior to surgery on 2008-08-11 00:00:00 an epidural was placed with good
effect.  Epidural was removed on 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Following this, the
patient received Morphine IV with good effect and adequate pain
control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications.  Following second
procedure 2008-08-11 00:00:00 patient was discharged the SICU intubated/sedated.
 As sedation was lightened, he was given intermittent dilaudid
IV and tylenol IV with adequate pain control.  Analgesia
transitioned to po when tolerating oral intake.

Extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to psychiatric medications
were treated with zyprexa with good effect.

CV: On admission to SICU 2008-08-11 00:00:00 patient required prn doses of
lopressor/hydralazine for BP control.  These were continued on
the floor postoperatively.  Lasix was initially held then
resumed when patient had achieved adequate fluid balance.
Following second surgery 2008-08-11 00:00:00, the patient transiently required
pressors to maintain adequate BP.  Pressors were weaned 2008-08-11 00:00:00 and
patient was transferred back to CC6.  Vital signs were routinely
monitored.

RUE swelling noted 2008-08-11 00:00:00 prompted U/S RUE 2008-08-11 00:00:00 that showed
basilic v thrombosis extending to axillary vein.  RUE PICC
removed with plan to replace on contralateral side at
rehabilitation facility. The patient was started on SC
therapeutic lovenox on 2008-08-11 00:00:00, to bridge until therapeutic on
coumadin, with a goal INR of 2.0-3.0.

Pulmonary: Patient was appropriately extubated following surgery
2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry and early
ambulation were encouraged.  Remained intubated/sedated
initially following procedure 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Successfully extubated 2008-08-11 00:00:00
and transferred to floor 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Patient maintained adequate
pulmonary function following this.  The patient was stable from
a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI/GU: Patient presented as above and was made NPO/IVF/NGT
following surgery 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  NGT was self-d/c'd on POD0-1.  Patient
tolerated sips on POD1.  Patient was slow to resume bowel
function and was maintained on sips.  On POD5 patient complained
of significant abdominal distention/pain.  CT scan showed
copious intra-abdominal free air and patient was taken back to
operating room for exploratory laparotomy 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Small pinhole
leak at anastomosis was taken down and Hartmann's procedure was
performed.  Postoperatively, patient had ileus and colostomy was
cannulated with a red rubber catheter to aid in decompression.
KUB's obtained were consistent with ileus.  Given failure to
resume bowel function, TPN was started 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Bowel function
then returned and patient then tolerated clears 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  Diet was
advanced to regular 2008-08-11 00:00:00 and TPN was discontinued at this time.
He was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel
movement.

Foley was removed on POD#3 with removal of epidural and patient
failed trial of void.  Foley was replaced and patient discharged
with foley in place to attempt trial of void conducted by PCP vs
rehabilitation facility.  Intake and output were closely
monitored.

ID: Patient was initially given appropriate surgical prophylaxis
for procedure 2008-08-11 00:00:00.  On takeback to OR 2008-08-11 00:00:00, patient was started
on cipro/flagyl for bowel perforation/anastomotic leak.
Antibiotic course to be completed at rehabilitation facility per
discharge instructions.  Of note, patient had minor wound
discharge requiring removal of staples and placement of wound
vac to aid in healing process.  The patient's temperature was
closely watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

PSYCH: Psychiatric medications were held while patient NPO.
Resumed full regimen 2008-08-11 00:00:00 which was tolerated well.

At the time of discharge on 2008-08-11 00:00:00, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, at
baseline mobility, with indwelling foley for failure to void,
and pain was well controlled.
