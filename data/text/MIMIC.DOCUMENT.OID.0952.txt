HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 59-year-old
gentleman diagnosed with metastatic renal cell cancer in 2014-10-10 00:00:00.  He underwent a debulking left nephrectomy with Dr.
Svehla on 2014-10-10 00:00:00, and was diagnosed with metastatic
kidney cancer by thyroidectomy in 2014-10-10 00:00:00.  This
revealed high grade renal cell carcinoma that was metastatic
to the adrenal gland.  Following debulking nephrectomy, he
was found to be presented with severe bone pain.  Location of
his pain was in the right shoulder.  Given that the pain did
not resolve, he underwent a MRI which showed ultimately a
lytic lesion in the right shoulder and was treated with
radiation therapy to the shoulder as well as ultimately
undergoing treatment with chemotherapy.  He did not respond
to chemotherapy and developed a large lytic lesion in the
left femur requiring an operative embolization and rod
placement in 02/2014-10-10 00:00:00.  Following that, he had multiple
radiation therapies to the spine as well as right scapula as
well as left femur.

He was seen on multiple occasions over the last several weeks
complaining of increasing pain in the right shoulder.  CT
scan revealed a large lytic lesion.  Given that this area had
been radiated twice, tentatively booked to see Dr. Claudene Djokovic
in Radiology for radiofrequency ablation for pain relief.  He
has been on OxyContin 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Morphine elixir
for breakthrough pain, and he has been a little better over
the last few days.  He has not moved his bowels in three
days, and also had difficulty urinating.  This initially felt
to be related to the increase in narcotic, but now he
describes difficulty feeling a full bladder, and had been
voiding very little over the last day.  He was admitted to
the Oncology service for workup of this urinary retention.
He is also complaining of leg weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was a gentleman in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  EOMs full.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Neurologically, cranial
nerves II through XII intact.  His motor strength is 2014-10-10 00:00:00 in
the right upper extremity, 2014-10-10 00:00:00 in the left upper extremity,
and 2014-10-10 00:00:00 on bilateral lower extremities.  His reflexes in the
upper extremities and lower extremities is symmetric, and
sensation to cold and pin prick and light touch bilaterally,
gait are normal.  There is no saddle anesthesia.

He was admitted now with urinary retention and bowel
retention likely due to increased pain medication, but will
rule out cord compression.  He had a MRI of his cervical
spine, which showed evidence of tumor at the T1-T3 level with
moderate-to-severe cord compression.  Also disease at the T1
level causing some deformity of the spinal cord.  Therefore
Neurosurgery was consulted.

The patient was taken to the Neurosurgery service and brought
to the operating room for decompression laminectomy of the
thoracic and cervical spine.  First on 2014-10-10 00:00:00, underwent
a thoracic embolization of the tumor, and then was taken to
the operating room on 2014-10-10 00:00:00, and underwent T2-T3
resection of metastatic lesions, spinal cord decompression
with segmental C7-T4 stabilization.

Postoperative, his vital signs were stable.  He was afebrile.
His motor strength was 2014-10-10 00:00:00 in all muscle groups.  He had no
pronator drift.  His laboratories were within normal limits.
He was neurologically stable and transferred to the regular
floor.  He has had two drains in place, which stayed in until
postoperative day #5.  He had minimal output of both drains
on day five, and they were pulled.  Continued on IV
antibiotic treatment while drains were in place.  His
incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  He was seen by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, and was thought to
possibly acquire rehab, although made significant improvement
over his hospital stay, and opted for discharge to home with
followup with Dr. Svehla in two weeks for staple removal.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Diazepam 5 mg p.o. q.6h.
2. Gentamicin ophthalmic solution one drop OU q.4h.
3. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lactulose 30 cc p.o. q.4h. prn.
5. OxyContin 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Morphine 5-10 mg p.o. q.4-6h. for breakthrough pain.
7. Senna one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
8. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  He has a figure-of-eight
brace, which he should wear at all times until his followup
with Dr. Svehla in two weeks for staple removal.  His
incisions was clean, dry, and intact.  He ambulation was
improved.  His sensation and strength in his lower
extremities is intact.  He will follow up also with his
oncologist in 2014-10-10 00:00:00.  His vital signs are stable at the
time of discharge.
