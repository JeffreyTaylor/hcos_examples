Pertinent Results:
2007-04-25 00:00:00 Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated no significant disease. The LCMA was very short.
The LAd had an ostial 20% stenosis and a possible
intramyocardial segment involving the first septal branch. The
LCx had minimal luminal irregularities. The RCA had a posterior
origin and had minimal luminal irregularities. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling
pressures, with an RVEDP of 19 mm Hg and a PCWP of 28 mm Hg with
large V waves (to 45 mm Hg). There was severe pulmonary arterial
systolic hypertension, with a PASP of 60 mm Hg. The cardiac
index was preserved at 3.6 L/min/m2. There was mild systemic
arterial hypertenion, with an SBP of 149 mm Hg.

2007-04-25 00:00:00 Echo: PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. The ascending, transverse
and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the incisors. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr.Casimiro was notified in person of the
results on Mr.Casimiro before surgical incision.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is on infusions of epinephrine and
phenylephrine and is V-paced. Overall left ventricular systolic
function continues to be borderline normal. There is a new
mechanical bileaflet prosthesis in the mitral position. The
valve is well seated with jets consistent with typical washing
jets. The mean gradient across the valve is 4 mmHg at a CO of
3.7 L/min.The thoracic aorta is intact post decannulation of the
femoral artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted preoperatively for heparin bridge due to mechanical
aortic valve. He underwent preoperative workup that included
cardiac catheterization and transesophageal echocardiogram. On
2007-04-25 00:00:00 he was brought to the operating room for mitral valve
replacement via right thoracotomy. See operative report for
further details. He received Vancomycin and Cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for management. He required pressors, inotropes and
pacer rate increased for hemodynamic support. In the first
twenty four hours he was weaned off drips, awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without complications. He continued to
progress and was started on beta blockers and diuretics. In the
afternoon of postoperative day one his urine output decreased,
creatinine was checked and found to be elevated with evidence of
acute kidney injury. Diuretics were stopped and Foley remained
for monitoring output. He was transferred to the floor. Physical
therapy worked with him on strength and mobility. His kidney
function improved after peaking at 2.5 with the acute kidney
injury and he continued on lasix for diuresis due to volume
overload.  He was started on heparin and coumadin for
anticoagulation due to mechanical mitral and aortic valves and
atrial fibrillation.  His amiodarone was temporarily increased
due to atrial fibrillation and his betablockers were
progressively titrated for heart rate management.  He continued
to progress and was ready for discharge home with services on
post operative day eight.  All follow-up appointments were
advised.
