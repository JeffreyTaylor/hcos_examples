CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old gentleman
with a history of bleeding, internal hemorrhoids, status post
cauterization seven days prior to admission who was started
on Plavix three days prior to admission.  He was admitted to
the medical Intensive Care Unit for bright red blood per
rectum.  The patient said the bleeding started suddenly at 2
o'clock PM on the day of admission with passing large clots
and bright red blood per rectum.  This was not associated
with abdominal pain, nausea, fevers, chills, diarrhea.  The
patient reports he has bright red blood per rectum on a daily
basis, this is basically self-limited.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complains of severe rectal
pain.  No complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, short of breath
or dysuria.

In the emergency department, the patient continued to have
profuse bright red blood per rectum and was transfused two
units of packed red blood cells.  His blood pressure had
decreased, systolic blood pressure in the 80's which was
corrected by fluid boluses. Colonoscopy revealed an actively
bleeding internal hemorrhoid which was ligated.

scleras.

LABORATORY on admission white cell count 8.3, hemoglobin 9.8,
hematocrit 29.7, platelets 157, sodium 142, potassium 4.0.
Chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, BUN 54, creatinine 4.7, glucose

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed. The patient admitted with
gastrointestinal bleed from internal hemorrhoids, status post
ligation in the emergency department.  The patient received a
total of 5 units packed red blood cells in the emergency
department and medical Intensive Care Unit.  By 2006-09-24 00:00:00 the
patient was having only trace bleeding and hematocrit has
stabilized.  Upon transfer to the floor on 2006-09-24 00:00:00 hematocrit
continued to be monitored closely.  On the morning of 2006-09-24 00:00:00
the patient had a drop in hematocrit from 26.9 to 24.6 and
received one more unit of packed red blood cells.  Throughout
the remainder of the stay the patient's hematocrit was stable
and he did not require further transfusions.

2.  Change in mental status.  In the medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient received Ambien, Morphine, and Tylenol for
control of rectal pain.  After receiving these medications
the patient became confused with orientation only to his self
on 2006-09-24 00:00:00.  It was hypothesized that the Morphine was the
most likely cause of the patient's change in mental status.
The Morphine was discontinued and the patient was given
Tylenol for pain control.  Other possible causes of change in
mental status that were considered included Intensive Care
Unit psychosis which was unlikely the short amount of time
the patient spent in the unit.  In addition, an underlying
infection was considered but the patient remained afebrile
and without an elevated white blood count.  After being taken
off the Morphine and having his pain controlled only with
Tylenol the patient's mental status changes resolved.

3.  Acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was increased
in creatinine from baseline.  Most likely secondary to
hyperperfusion in the setting of his gastrointestinal bleed.
A renal ultrasound was obtained which did not show any
hydronephrosis or post obstructive problems.  His creatinine
is trending down following intravenous hydration and p.o.
intake.

4.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient is currently off
anti-coagulation given his gastrointestinal bleed.  At this
time, anti-coagulation will be held until the patient follows
up with surgery in two weeks.  At that time, if the patient
is cleared by surgery, Neurology and the Stroke Team
recommend long-term anti-coagulation for the patient with a
goal INR of 2 to 3.

5.  Hypertension.  The patient's anti-hypertensive was held
on admission given his hypotension from the severe
gastrointestinal bleed.  It was later held due to the
patient's chronic renal failure.  The patient will be
restarted on his Sparling today.  Blood pressure has been trending
upward and his creatinine is trending down to baseline.

6.  Fluid, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient
tolerating a house diet.  Electrolytes have been corrected as
needed.

7.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was on Unna boots for deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis throughout the hospitalization.  He
was continued on a bowel regimen to avoid constipation.  The
patient was continued on PPI.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed from internal hemorrhoids, status
post ligation.
2.  Mental status changes, not otherwise specified, now
resolved.
3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Anemia.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
7.  Acute renal insufficiency.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  E123 Any St. 10,000 units subcutaneously one time per week.
3.  Ederson Hanss 8.6 mg one tab p.o. twice a day.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. four times a day.
5.  Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q day.
6.  Valsartan 80 mg p.o. q day.
7.  Acetaminophen 325 mg one to two tabs p.o. q 4 to 6 hours
p.r.n.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should follow-up with PCP Sparling. Brandan
at earliest convenience.

Neurology on 2006-09-24 00:00:00 at 10:00.
