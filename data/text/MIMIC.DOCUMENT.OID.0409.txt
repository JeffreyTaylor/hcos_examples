Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Bieler is a 24yo M from UPMCE Rehab baseline Alert and
Orientedx3 , h/o Parkinson's s/p trach, multiple aspiration
events, HTN, PTX admitted with bleeding around trach site and
possible GIB.
.
# Trach site bleeding/GIB: Patient was admitted out for concern
for GI bleed.  Hct was 25.6 at rehab on 2014-08-02 00:00:00 and stable on
admission and throughout hospital course, so a large GI bleed
was felt to be unlikely.  The situation was felt to be
consistent with a trach site bleed with aspiration.  Dark fluid
from 2014-08-02 00:00:00 to gravity was consistent with the color of medications
(iron) the patient usually receives.  Pt was guaiac and
gastroccult negative.  We maintained an active Type and Screen,
and monitored his hematocrits regularly; he did not require any
transfusions.  His tube feeds were restarted when we felt that
the bleed was more from the trach site (which is now resolved).
We continued him at first on a PPI IV BID, but then transitioned
him to daily PPI.  Pt has been asymptomatic, and given low
probability of GI bleed, a GI consult was not called for this
patient. (Of note, his Hct was stable compared to a hct of 24.0
in 2014-08-02 00:00:00).
.
# Respiratory failure: chronically trached.  The patient was
continued on his home vent settings and we continued his home
nebulizer treatments.  There was a noted cuff-[**Year (4 digits) 3515**] from his
trach, and this was evaluated by respiratory therapy, who
contactGiacomin Bieler respiratory therapy at UPMCE Rehab.  Essentially,
this is a long standing issue, and further management has been
deferred to the team at UPMCE Rehab.
.
# UTI: We held off on treating the patient for his positive UA
as he is likely chronically colonized and was afebrile
throughout.  Urine Cx was negative.  A foley was inserted for
high volume on a bladder scan.  As per report, Mr. Bieler
requires periodic straight cath to drain his bladder.
.
# Parkinson's disease: Pt with severe dysphagia, and
tracheostomy.  On admission, patient was slightly more rigid
than normal, which was attributed to missing a dose of
medications.  He was continued on home PD medications, and his
neurological exam returned to baseline as per conversation with
the patient's wife.

Discharge Instructions:
Dr. Bieler it was a pleasure caring for you at UPMCE.  You were
admitted from UPMCE Rehab MACU with concern for a possible GI
bleed.  During your work up here at UPMCE, we test the contents
from your UPMCE tube and stool, and found that there was no blood
present.  A CT scan of your abdomen/pelvis showed that you were
very constipated but no other concerning findings.  Your blood
counts were monitored closely and remained stable.  After an
aggressive bowel regimen your constipation resolved and you were
able to tolerate your tube feeds at your prior rate.
.
We did not make any changes to your medication regimen during
your stay, please continue to take all medications as 123 Any St.usly
prescribed.

Followup Instructions:
You will continue to be followed by the physicians at the UPMCE
Rehab MACU after your discharge.
