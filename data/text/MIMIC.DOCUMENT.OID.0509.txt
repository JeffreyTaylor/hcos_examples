hypothermic with T min 93.7, hypotensive with SBP 94/60 in
Trendelenberg and intermittent SBP down to 70's, and
hypoglycemic to 34 on random finger stick check. She was given
NS boluses and dextrose and one hour after dextrose hypoglycemic

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Gronowski is an 84 year old woman with ESRD on HD and recent
admission for C diff colitis who was admitted from her nursing
home after she was noted to have recurrence of c. difficile
colitis.  Originally admitted to the medicine service, the
patient to the MICU with hypothermia with T min 93.7,
hypotension with systolic blood pressures intermittently falling
from 90's to the 70's, and hypoglycemia to 34 on random finger
stick check who is adrenally insufficient by Gronowski stim.  The
patient was never in respiratory distress and did not require
intubation.  Her hypotension improved with IV fluid resuscitaion
(3 L NS) and was transferred to floor soon thereafter.  While in
MICU, She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, pan
cultures and chest x-ray did not reveal any signs of infection.
She was found to have   Stool cultures were negative for c.
diff. toxin.  Vancomycin was discontinued in MICU.

An cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to determine
whether adrenal insufficiency was a cause of her hypotension.
This revealed normal AM cortisol levels but a somewhat sluggish
response to cosyntropin.  The patient was therefore started on
high dose steroids.  This was tapered off by discharge.

Another potential contributing factor behind the patients prior
hypotension may have been her poor PO intake and, perhaps, her
hypoglycemia. For this reason the patient had a PEG tube placed
to aid her nutritional status.

The patient's stay on the medical floor was otherwise relatively
uneventful, she continued her schedule of dialysis without
complication.  On discharge she remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable with blood pressures in the normal to
high range.

In summary, this is an 84 year-old woman with ESRD on HD
admitted from nursing home for diarrhea secondary to c. dificile
infection who developed hypotension and hypoglycemia.  She
responded well hemodynamically to IV fluid resuscitation.  No
potential source of infection was definitively identified but
patient did well with broad spectrum antibiotics.  It is likely
that her hypotension was secondary to intravascular de123 Any St.n
from diarrhea in the setting of poor PO intake and, possibly,
borderline adrenal insufficiency.  On discharge, she was without
signs of infection other than occasional diarrhea, and was
hemodynamically stable.  She received a PEG tube for feeding to
aid her nutritional status.

Issues and plan arising from this admission:

1. C. dificile infection.  Diarrhea may have been major
contributor to hypotension.  But patient was likely never septic
per se.   Pan cultures unrevealing
-can continue flagyl for approximately two weeks after
discharge.

2. Heel ulcers. Ap123 Any St.te podiatry input (Dr. Elis Garrey.  X-rays
did not indicate osteomyelitis.  Vascular surgery was Gronowski.
 They had seen the patient on prior admissions and felt the
patient needed an angiogram.
-to see vascular surgery and receive angiogram as outpatient

3. New T wave inversions but difficult to interpret with
electrolyte abnormalities.  The patient was ruled out for MI.
Repeat EKG's were unchanged.

4. Poor nutritional status/poor a123 Any St.e: 2010-10-01 00:00:00 also have
contributed to hypotension
-PEG in place for use in supplementation of pt PO intake.

5. ESRD/ atient of Dr. Gronowski (who is aware of patients
admission).  The patient was dialyzed on schedule during her
admission.

6. Hypoglycemia. Most likely from long standing malnutrition and
poor po intake.

7. Coagulopathy. Patient on coumadin and INR likely elevated in
the setting of Abx use. The patient did receive Vit K IV dose.
Coumadin was held prior to the patient getting her PEG tube.

8. Atrial Fibrillation. Currently in sinus.  Coumadin was held
on prior to the patient getting a PEG.
-continuing coumadin

9. Leg swelling (R side) - A LENI ruled out DVT.

10. Depression - continued on Remeron 15mg qHS

11. GERD - Continued on protonix 40mg QD

12. COPD/Asthma - continued on combivent

13. Poor Nutritional Status - PO intake encourage, PEG placed
for supplementation.  Pt to continue renal, heart healthy,
diabetic diet.

The code status of this patient is DNR/DNI, confirmed with
attending physician.
