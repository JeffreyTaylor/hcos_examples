Patient was refered to the Ed after VNA call physician with
hypotension, Jameliah Snarski and low PO intake. On arrival, patient
with respiratory distress, tachypneic, tachycardic. VS Hr 154,
Bp 189/88 RR 28 Sats 100%. EKG stE v2-v4, st depression v5, v6,
I and AVL. She was also tachycardic and adenosin, + diltiazem
were given to control her HR.  Stat CT shopwed CT showed

IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema and bilateral pleural
effusions.
.

CT head: 2008-12-05 00:00:00
FINDINGS: The study is severely limited due to patient motion.
There is no evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or
mass effect. A small subarachnoid hemorrhage or extraaxial
hematoma cannot be excluded. The ventricles and sulci grossly
appear normal. No large displaced fracture is evident. The
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinus appear to be clear. Left
frontal osteoma is unchanged in appearance. Catasha Broseker-white matter
differentiation appears to be preserved in the images of the
brain that were less degraded by motion.

IMPRESSION: Study limited by patient motion. No large
intracranial hemorrhage identified. Small subarachnoid
hemorrhage or extraaxial hematoma cannot be excluded.
.
CTA chest:
CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: The heart size is
enlarged with severe coronary artery disease and calcification
of the aortic valve. Atherosclerotic calcifications are also
noted in the aorta. There is extensive pulmonary embolism
involving all segments of the right lung. The appearance of the
thrombi is most consistent with acute pulmonary embolism. There
is no radiographic evidence of right heart strain. There are
also no filling defects in the visualized IVC to suggest
extension of renal cell carcinoma as a cause for pulmonary
embolism. Visualization of the lungs is limited by motion
artifact; images were obtained during expiratory phase. There is
suggestion of several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules
that cannot be further evaluated on the current study. There is
also moderate-to-large right and small-to-moderate left simple,
layering pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. There is
also left greater than right subpulmonic effusion. No
mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy is noted. Very limited
views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

There is an old healed fracture of the left lateral fifth rib.
There are no regions of bone destruction suspicious for
metastasis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive acute pulmonary embolism in all segments of the
right lung. The findings were discussed with Dr. Catasha Broseker Snarski
upon com123 Any St.n of the study.
2. Several centrilobular and other pulmonary nodules are
suggested on this exam limited by motion. A repeat CT scan as an
outpatient after resolution of these acute setting may be
warranted. However, given that PET CT of 2008-12-05 00:00:00 was negative
for metastatic pulmonary lesion, the likelihood of these nodules
representing new metastatic lesions is decreased.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with subpulmonic effusions.
4. Cardiomegaly with severe coronary artery disease.
.
Cardiac Echocardiogram 2008-12-05 00:00:00
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of 2008-12-05 00:00:00, the left ventricular function has
significantly worsened. The aortic stenosis is moderate to
severe. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function.

Cardiac cath report: 2008-12-05 00:00:00
HISTORY:   73 yo female with a history of lung cancer,
metastatic
renal cell carcinoma with met to right femur s/p recent
reconstruction
admitted on 2008-12-05 00:00:00 with large right-sided pulmonary embolism
with
hypoxia for which she was intubated. With hypotension requiring
pressors
and ST elevations in V1-V4, concern for STEMI and directed to
cath lab
with troponin 0.31. Echo shows EF 15-20% with severe aortic
stenosis.
For coronary evaluation, ?valvuloplasty.
.
Initial angiography revealed an 80% LM stenosis with damping of
the catheter with engagement of the LM and a 70-80% stenosis of
the mid LAD as well. We planned to treat the lesions with direct
stenting. A prowater wire crossed the lesion into the lad with
minimal difficulty. A JL4 provided adequate support for the
procedure. The patient had received iv lytics for her PE in the
emergency department and thus she received prophyactic hpearin
in the cath lab. A 3.5x12mm driver stent was deployed in the LM
at 16 atm and post dilated with a 4x12mm quantum maverick
balloon at 20 atm with excellent result and no evidence of
jailing either the lad or lcx. We then turned our attention to
the mid LAD lesion. A 3.0x24mm driver stent was deployed in the
mid  lad at 9 atm and then post dilated with a 3.0x12mm quantum
maverick balloon at 21 atm. Final angiography revealed 0%
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and
timi 3 flow. The patient remained hypotensive and ventuilated in
critical condition.  Successful  perclose of the right groin at
the end of the case.  As the patient was about to be transported
up to the CCU for further care, the patient went into PEA arrest
with prolonged rescucitation effort. There was difficulty
re-obtaining arterial access but once we did, angiography of LM
revealed patent LM stent. There was absence of flow elsewhere in
the left coronary in the setting of an asystolic heart. Code
efforts were stopped at this time and the patient was pronounced
dead and the family notified.
.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a
proximal 80% stenosis in the LMCA. The LAD had a 70-80% stenosis
in the mid portion with a 50% stenosis at the origin of the
diagonal. The LCX had a 60% stenosis at the origin. The OM1 had
a proximal 80% stenosis. OM2 and OM3 were without obstructive
disease. The RCA had a proximal 80% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right-sided
filling
pressures. The RASP was 22 mm Hg, RVEDP 30 mm Hg, PASP 57 mm Hg,
PCWP 35
mm Hg and LVEDP 40 mm Hg. The cardiac output was 4.6 and cardiac
index
was 2.5 l/min/m2.
3. There was a mean gradient of 23 mm Hg across the aortic valve
with a
calculated area across the aortic valve of 0.73 cm2 consistent
with
severe aortic stenosis.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
.
Successful LM and LAD stenting with a 3.5x12mm driver stent post
dilated
to 4.0mm in the LM and a 3.0x24 driver stent posted to 3.0mm in
the LAD.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and timi 3 flow. Successful right perclose
device.
Subsequent PEA arrest with prolonged but unsuccesful
rescusitative
efforts. The patient died and the family was informed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
