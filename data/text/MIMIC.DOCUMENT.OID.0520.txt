History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with hx of prior CVA with residual R-sided weakness, AS
(123 Any St. 1.2 cm2), known cecal and s123 Any St. flexure masses, recently
admitted for sub-sternal chest pressure in the setting of BRBPR
and a Hct of 20.8 presents with substernal chest pressure in
setting of BRBPR.
.
Of note the patient was admitted from 2014-08-05 00:00:00 through 2014-08-05 00:00:00
with BRBPR, acute on chronic anemia and chest pain with ECG
changes. The patient was observed in the MICU for 1 day and
given a total of 4pRBCs on 2014-08-05 00:00:00 that brought her Hct from
20.8 to 30.8. The patients chest pain subsequently resolved and
she was discharged home. There was a recommendation for tagged
RBC scan during that admission, however she had no further
episodes of bleeding during the hospitalization.
.
Since discharge the patient has had mulitple episodes of BRBPR.
Last night the pt noted "significant BRBPR". On the morning of
admission patient reported substernal chest pain across her
chest that resembled prior episodes of chest pain. She was
brought to the ED, where initial VS were 97.8 77 141/48 19 97.
Labs were notable for Hct of 20.7 (down from 27.6 on 2014-08-05 00:00:00). ECG
notable for NSR 66 STD V3-6. General surgery was consulted. The
patient was admitted to MICU for closer monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F with hx of prior CVA with residual R-sided weakness, AS (123 Any St.
1.2  cm2), known cecal and s123 Any St. flexure masses, recently
admitted for sub-sternal chest pressure in the setting of BRBPR
and a Hct of 20.8 presents with substernal chest pressure in
setting of BRBPR. She was ruled out for MI by EKG and enzymes.
.
# GI Bleed: Admission Hct was 20.7, and pt was transfused a
total of 4 units PRBC to maintain a hct in the high 20s to low
30s. Pantoprazole drip started; switched to PO on the floor. She
continued to have melenic and frankly bloody bowel movement. NG
lavage was negative for UGI bleed; did not show any bile. Tagged
RBC scan did not show active bleed. Colonoscopy showed s123 Any St.
flexure and hepatic flexure masses concerning for malignancy;
also showed rectal polyp that was presumed to be the source of
bleeding (although was not bleeding at the time of colonscopy).
Discussion regarding surgery vs medical management was ongoing
throughout admission. Ultimately surgery decided that they would
not intervene and recommended that patient follow up as an
outpatient or sooner if she were to re-bleed. Patient's aspirin
and lisinopril were held.

# Substernal Chest Pressure: Resembles prior episode in setting
of ECG changes suggestive of ischemia. Cardiac biomarkers
negative. Likely demand ischemia in setting of gastrointestinal
bleed. Pain resolved and patient's hct was kept in 28-30 range.
Statin was continued.
.
# HTN: BP stable. Antihypertensives were initially held in the
setting of bleed, but verapamil was eventually restarted.
Lisinopril was discontinued per Jenohn Peninger recommendations.
.
# Prophylaxis: Pneumatic boots.
.
# Code: Full code
