Colonscopy (2014-07-18 00:00:00) Large hard rectal stool ball was noted on
rectal exam. The scope was then passed into the transverse
colon. There was only a small amount of liquid stool present in
the sigmoid and descending colon. However, in the transverse
colon there was solid stool present. The scope was unable to be
passed through this region. The scope was withdrawn. Biopsies
were obtained in the rectum. Manual disimpaction was performed
with good results. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the rectum.

Abd Xray:Moderate amount of stool seen within the rectum and
throughout the
large bowel consistent with fecal impaction

CT of Abd: mildly thickened/edematous wall of rectum and distal
sigmoid colon (which could be infectious, and less likely
inflammatory,or ischemic. distended loops
of colon with large amount of fecal material)

CT sinus: Left maxillary and frontal retension cyst vs. polyp.
Minimal
mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus and ethmoid
sinus. No
evidence of acute sinusitis.
CXR:negative for focal pulmonary infiltrate; cephalization of
pulmonary vessels

Bld cx: pending
Urine Cx: Pending

Repeat KUB on 2014-07-18 00:00:00 showed pt still had large amt stool. KUB 2014-07-18 00:00:00
showed pt had large amt of air suggestive of ileus. 2014-07-18 00:00:00 KUB
improved with less air.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Constipation:  Pt would not take PO go lytely on floor and
did not take po for 3-4 days.  He was felt to be dehydrated and
given 2L overnight.  Pt increasingly aggitated overnight. Unable
to place Iv or NGT. Intubated and sedated on 2014-07-18 00:00:00 for placement
and disimpaction. Enema somewhat successful with mod amt of
stool. Unable to completely disimpact due to location of
impacted stool. Started Golytely via OGT and repeated enemas.
Manual disimpaction difficult as stool is high in
rectum/sigmoid. CT showed wall edema most likely 2014-07-18 00:00:00 prior
manual disimpaction.
- Repeat KUB on 2014-07-18 00:00:00 showed pt still impacted. Still receiving
golytely via ogt. Repeated enemas. Passed large amts of watery
stool.  2014-07-18 00:00:00 KUB showed no stool but increased air in colon
