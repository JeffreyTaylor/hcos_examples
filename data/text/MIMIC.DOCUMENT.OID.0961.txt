Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of 2013-01-30 00:00:00  12:31:40 PM
Ventricular bigeminy. Native beats are with slight right axis
deviation. Right
bundle-branch block. ST segment elevations in leads V4-V6 of
uncertain
significance. Compared to the 123 Any St.us tracing of 2013-01-30 00:00:00 right
axis deviation
and ventricualr ectopy have newly appeared.

Echo 2013-01-30 00:00:00:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function
appears depressed with inferior/inferolateral/apical
akinesis/hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given
the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
The
interatrial septum is bowed to the right.

Chest X-Ray 2013-01-30 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with
retrocardiac opacification likely due to atelectasis. Lungs
otherwise clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Migdal had no intra-operative complications,
post-operatively she was noted to have PVC's with bigeminy,
without anginal symptoms; cardiac enzymes were cycled and
elevated. A cardiology consult was placed for further management
of the NSTEMI. She was transferred to the intensive care unit
for close monitoring.

Neuro: NAD, A&Ox3 throughout her hospital stay, including
through her NSTEMI.  Immediately post-op patient was given a
morphine PCA.  On POD2 the PCA was d/c'd and pain was
well-controlled with Tylenol.  On discharge she had been pain
free for several days.

CV: Echo demonstrated depressed LV systolic function with
inferior apical hypokinesis. She was started on beta-blockade,
and transfused PRBC's to maintain her hematocrit > 30. She was
also started on an oral statin and when she became normotensive
it was recommended to also at low dose ace inhibitor. POD 7, she
developed atrial fibrillation with hypotension which responded
to an Amiodarone drip, she was then transitioned to oral
Amiodarone. Cardiology determined that she would benefit from
anticoagulation therapy, she received one dose of Coumadin, her
INR increased to 4.8. She was given 1u FFP with f/u INR of 3.5.
Coumadin was then held and her INR trended down slowly over the
remainder of her hospital stay.  She was discharged on 0.5mg
coumadin qhs with strict instructions to see her PCP on Jermia Migdal.
At discharge she was given prescriptions for ASA 81, amiodarone
taper, toprol XL, sivastatin, and instructions to discuss
starting an ACE-inhibitor with her PCP.

GI/GU: NPO until POD2 when she was advanced to clears.  Passed
flatus on POD4 but was kept on sips due to NSTEMI/ICU stay. POD7
diet advanced to regular and supplemented with Ensure.  At
discharge, colostomy was working well.

Skin: POD11 a 4cm diameter pressure ulcer was found at midline
upper back.  This was sharply debrided at the bedside and ulcer
was seen by surgery team as well as wound care nurse.  Patient
discharged with wound care regimen:

Change dressing Every 3 days, start 2013-01-30 00:00:00.  Clean wound bed with
commercial wound cleanser.  Apply Duoderm wound gel to wound
bed. Apply no sting barrier wipes to peri-wound skin.  Place
Allevyn foam dressing to site

MSK: PT evaluated patient and recomomended home PT, which we
arranged.
