History of Present Illness:
61 year old man, PMH of DM type II, with recent hospital
admission (2013-09-04 00:00:00) for enterococcal bacteremia and aortitis,
presented to OSH on 2013-09-04 00:00:00 complaining of 6 weeks of back pain
and bowel incontinence. Patient said onset of severe back pain
began approximately 6 weeks ago in lower right side, worse with
sitting or standing. If attempted to stand, he experience pain
shooting up his back. He last walked approximately 6 weeks ago.
The pain has been stable, not worsening. He reports mild
improvement. He is now able to roll in bed. Yesterday patient
was unable to turn his head to the side. That has since
resolved.
.
Two weeks ago, patient developed bowel incontinence. He can not
sense when he is going. He has loss of stool approximately
3-4x/day. Also reports decreased urine output with no leakage or
dribbling. Patient feels he is dehydrated.
He decided to go to the hospital when after attempting to get
out of bed he felt very dizzy and "things went black." Also
became concerned about his decreased urine output.
.
At OSH: MRI was notable for an L2-L3 epidural abscess.  Notable
findings at the OSH include ampicillin sensitive enterococcal
bacteremia, CT scan findings of possible aortitis and a right
pleural effusion.  He was started on ampicillin and gentamycin,
and transferred to UPMCE for surgical evaluation. Pt was started
on flagyl for diarrhea.
.
Mr. Easley is a 6xyo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with
EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred
from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and
enterococcal bacteremia.

Pertinent Results:
Initial MRI L Spine: Findings indicative of discitis and
osteomyelitis at L2-3 and L4-5 level. Inflammatory changes
posterior to the thecal sac at L2-3 level could be due to
phlegmon or a small epidural abscess. Inflammatory changes are
also seen involving the right psoas muscle and posterior
musculature at L4-5 level. Epidural enhancing soft tissues due
to phlegmon are also seen. Examination is limited and for better
evaluation if clinically indicated, a repeat study with proper
sedation is recommended.
.
MRI C/T/L spine 2013-09-04 00:00:00: Discitis and osteomyelitis at C5-C6
level.  No overt change in the extent of discitis and
osteomyelitis at L4-L5 level, incompletely assessed at L2-L3
level. Probable pelvic fluid, incompletely assessed.
.
TTE 2013-09-04 00:00:00: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall,
moderate hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall,
and extensive apical akinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There are filamentous strands on
the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant), although small vegetations cannot be excluded with
certainty. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Easley is a 66yo male with DM, CAD recently s/p NSTEMI with
EF 20-30%, PVD, hypoalbuminemia and COPD initially transferred
from OSH for management of C5-6 and L2/L3 osteomyelitis and
enterococcal bacteremia.

His hospital course is summarized as follows:
He was initially followed on the medical floor for medical
management of his MI and bacteremia but then transferred to the
MICU on 2013-09-04 00:00:00 when he became hypoxemic with an associated
respiratory acidosis.   In the MICU, patient was diuresed.
Initially Abx extended to vanco/zosyn/amp/gent for presumed PNA.
However CXR more consistent with worsening CHF and pleural
effusion.  PICC was placed for longterm antibiotic therapy.
.
Pt was called out to floor on 2013-09-04 00:00:00. On the floor, he
initially was stable then on 2013-09-04 00:00:00 became more SOB. CXR revealed
moderate R pleural effusion as well as worsening CHF. Diuresis
with Lasix plus albumin with minimal response.
.
On 2013-09-04 00:00:00, he was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring for
SOB.

MICU PROBLEM BASED COURSE SINCE 2013-09-04 00:00:00:
.
1. Respiratory Failure: Pt was initially intubated for
respiratory distress with subsequent multiple failed planned and
self-extubations throughout MICU course.  His respiratory
failure was likely secondary to large pleural effusions 2013-09-04 00:00:00 CHF
(EF 10-15%).  Hypoalbuminemia due to nephrotic syndrom also
playing large role as pt reaccumulated fluid s/p thoracentesis
and additionally, he has underlying COPD. On 2013-09-04 00:00:00 extubated, R
Thoracentesis removed 2L fluid. CXR improved following but
clinical scenario without change. Pt refused re-intubation
overnight. Worsening gas on bipap.  Pleural fluid labs:
transudate. On 2013-09-04 00:00:00 Reintubated (pt w/ barely adequate O2 resp
function on BiPap).  On 2013-09-04 00:00:00 Pt self-extubated and 2013-09-04 00:00:00
re-intubated secondary to increasing hypoxia, hypercarbia.  On
2013-09-04 00:00:00 extubated x1hr to speak with wife but was briefly
hypotensive with reintubation, requiring levophed.
On 2013-09-04 00:00:00 pt extubated himself, agreed to reintubation.  2013-09-04 00:00:00 R
Thoracentesis removed 1.8 L, stopped due to hypotension
requiring levophed temporarily. On 2013-09-04 00:00:00 Trach placed by IP and
respiratory status remained stable through remaining hospital
course. He is able to breath off the vent for 8-10 hours on some
days, but then tires and requires to be replaced on the vent.
.
2. Hypotension: Pt originally presented hypotensive: Thought
most likely cardiogenic shock, although he did have many reasons
to be septic (osteomyelitis, TV vegetation, retropharyngeal
fluid collection).  Pt started on levophed 2013-09-04 00:00:00. remained
pressor dependant despite negative cultures since 2013-09-04 00:00:00.  Tried
dobutamine trial ~2013-09-04 00:00:00 and 2013-09-04 00:00:00 , pt failed (became hypotensive,
tachycardic). Attempted vasopressin 2013-09-04 00:00:00 w/ goal of levophed
wean: unsuccessful. D/ced vasopressin 2013-09-04 00:00:00. Also considered
component of hypovolemic shock given depleted intravascular
status w/ hypoalbuminemia, pt transfused to HCT 30 (2013-09-04 00:00:00) w/o
improvement in pressor requirement (continued levophed
requirement). Considered adrenal insufficiency, stim test on :
cosyntropin stim normall originally, normal on repeat 2013-09-04 00:00:00. On
2013-09-04 00:00:00-started Hydrocort trial: 100mg IV x1; allowed successful
wean off levophed. Continued steroids w/ 6 day tapering course,
finished 2013-09-04 00:00:00. 2013-09-04 00:00:00 while on steroids pt w/ stable BP. The
pt had 2L dialyzed off on 2013-09-04 00:00:00 and pt with hypotension w/ sbp 70
overnight responsive to 750 cc bolus. On 2013-09-04 00:00:00, temporary
hypotensive episode requiring levophed due to 1.8L volume
removal thoracentesis. 2013-09-04 00:00:00 pt hypotensive when in chair,
standing valium decreased to 2.5 TID (from 5), and
hydrocortisone restarted at 50 q 6. Given hypotension, the
fentanyl patch and valium were d/c'd and Fludrocortisone 0.2mg
daily was started for orthostasis.  Pt BP has thus been stable.
.
3. Anxiety / depression:   Patient intermittently angry,
attempting to lash out at nurses and making rude, offensive
statements. Evaluated by psychiatry given pt refused HD and
unclear if he is competent to make any decisions. -Unclear if
pts current "anger" is part of his pre-morbid personality vs
delirium. Zyprexa started 2013-09-04 00:00:00, Started SSRI, celexa 2013-09-04 00:00:00, using
standing valium to wean from midazolam drip s/p trach. After
psych evaluation began Haldol 5mg IV BID, then held Celexa in
setting of poor renal function.  On D/C haldol 5mg TID has been
working well and soothing his agitation.
 .
4. Tracheitis: pt w/ thick secretions decreasing.  sputum w/ +
growth for Kleibsiella oxtocea, enterobacter cloacae on 2013-09-04 00:00:00,
both sensitive to cefepime. 2013-09-04 00:00:00 and 2013-09-04 00:00:00 sputum remains + for
gram - rods. Continue cefepime (had started cefepime and vanco
2013-09-04 00:00:00, changed temporarily to ceftriaxone for better gram -
coverage prior to sensitivites, reverted back to cefepime
2013-09-04 00:00:00)through 2013-09-04 00:00:00 for 15d course
.
5. Renal Failure: F: likely prerenal F, as pt w/ hypotension and
pressor requirement. Pt also w/ diabetic nephropathy.  total
protein 3207g=nephrotic syndrome. Hypoalbuminemia playing large
role in cardiovascular compromise as pt third spacing tremendous
amount of fluid (+8L prior to CVVH, now +7L on intermittent HD).
CVVH used as temprorary bridge for volume removal.  clinical
condition did not improve. CVVH stopped as was not considered to
be permanent solution given ICU requirement.  renal plan for
renal biopsy when/if pt stable to determine if any aspect of
nephrotic dz would be steroid responsive. After successful
levophed wean pt attempted on HD trials: trials of intermittent
HD successful thus far, pt has tolerated fluid removal and
remained hemodynamically stable.
.
6. Pleural effusion: reaccumulated w/i 48 hrs s/p thoracentesis
on 2013-09-04 00:00:00, quick reaccumulation suspected to be related to
hypoalbuminemia. Likely contributing to pts resp distress. c/s
IP to discuss feasability of successful pleurodesis: IP does not
believe procedure would be successful. IP performed
thoracentesis on 2013-09-04 00:00:00, removed 1.8 L on 2013-09-04 00:00:00, stopped fluid
removal secondary to hypotensive episode.
.
7. Vertebral osteo: osteomyelitis at L2-3, L4-5, C5-6.
2013-09-04 00:00:00: MRI total spine 2013-09-04 00:00:00: retropharyngeal fluid collection at
level of C1-C5; may be pre-vertebral as opposed to
retropharyngeal,adjacent to C5-6 vertebrae w/ appearance c/w
osteomyleitis. 2013-09-04 00:00:00: MRI neck: improved retropharyngeal fluid
collection.  Continued appearance of edematous and enhancing C5
vertebral body and C 2013-09-04 00:00:00 interval disc space. Ortho spine
evaluated and no concern for fluid collection itself
compromising vital structures; therefore no need surgical
intervention. Treatment continues wtih ampicillin for
osteomyelitis.
.
8. Endocarditis: TEE 2013-09-04 00:00:00 confirms large TV vegetation, +AV
vegetation. Continue ampicillin x8 weeks.

.
9. Enterococcus bacteremia per OSH (E. Faecalis):  Was on
amp/gent from OSH for synergistic coverage for presumed
endocarditis. Recently on amp alone as all blood cx here (from
2013-09-04 00:00:00 onward) have been negative, possible sources (TV veg on
TTE, osteo, cervical fluid collection). tx for endocarditis and
osteo: abx x minimum 8wks. at UPMCE was on vanco/zosyn
2013-09-04 00:00:00, changed back to amp on 2013-09-04 00:00:00. blood cx negative at
UPMCE since 2013-09-04 00:00:00. 8 wk course = ampicillin until 2013-09-04 00:00:00 for osteo
and endocarditis.
.
10. Diabetes Mellitus: Pt originally on ISS w/ good control.
The pts sugars elevated when steroids started so insulin drip
was used.  The drip was d/ced 2013-09-04 00:00:00 as steroid course finished
and pt put on ISS.
.
11. L foot ulcers: Likely secondary to poor wound healing and
Diabetes, no evidence of osteo on foot films.  Also small ulcer
on right foot. Pt seen and evaluated by wound care.
.
12. Aortitis: There was a oncern for infrarenal aortitis on OSH
studies. On vascular read, also with possible ascending
aortitis.  Final radiology CT read: chronic/dormant aortitis.
Per vascular surgery- no surgical intervention necessary.
.
13. Abdominal pain: Pt had intermittent episodes of abdominal
pain 2013-09-04 00:00:00, appear to have resolved though pt
intubated/sedated: central/RUQ. Difficult to fully abscess given
intubation.  Chest pain worked up as above.  Possibly
constipation. 2013-09-04 00:00:00 RUQ US -, LFTs nl except mild lipase
elevation at 64. Issue resolved on own.
.
14. Chest pain: Intermittent episodes of chest pain during MICU
admission. The last episode  2013-09-04 00:00:00 early morning pt hypotensive w/
chest pain and diaphoresis. The levophed increased, pain
resolved. Cardiac enzymes were sent but ?relevance of results
given pt on CVVH. At micu admission pt w/ known CAD, cardiac
ischemia, elevated troponins (~6) w/ hypotension and tachycardia
thought to be likely demand ischemia versus ACS. Hx=NSTEMI 2013-09-04 00:00:00,
pt refused cath. 2013-09-04 00:00:00 TEE w/ EF of 2013-09-04 00:00:00% which is decreased
from prior estimate (8/14 20-30%). Pt  medically managed (asa,
statin, plavix.  We were unable to pursue cath at this time due
to + valve vegetations
.
15. A. Aireana Easley Pt started on amiodarone bolus/drip started 2013-09-04 00:00:00 and
subsequently converted to PO.  On 2013-09-04 00:00:00: pt converted to NSR at
~1030 On 2013-09-04 00:00:00: pt w/ irregular rhythm, ? aflutter w/ irreg
block.  As of 2013-09-04 00:00:00 pt has been stable on amiodarone.
.
16. Aireana Easley pt found to be hypernatremia, continues to
receive free water bolus through NGT.
