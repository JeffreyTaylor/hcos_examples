History of Present Illness:
Ms. Labounty is a 36 year old female with a history of SLE, lupus
nephritis, ESRD on PD who presented to the ER with two days of
chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. At home she had
been having pain. She had been having pain during her PD
sessions at home, and was having difficulty tolerating the PD
sessions, so she stopped doing her home PD sessions Sunday
evening. Over the next few days, she started having more
shortness of breath, was experiencing chest heaviness, orthopnea
and PND. Her shortness of breath worsened over, and she
presented to the ER today for further evaluation. She denies any
cough, nasal congestion, fever/chills, night sweats, n/v/d. Does
have her baseline abdominal pain and has felt worsening
"abdominal heaviness" since missing her PD sessions.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T-98.2 P-124 BP-133/92 R-24 O2
sat-98%. On arrival she was tachypneic to the 20's, complaining
of chest heaviness and also tachycardic. She had a CXR that
showed bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular
congestion, an EKG that showed sinus tachycardia with TWI in I,
AVL. An echocardiogram was done that was mostly unchanged from
prior, showing an LVEF of 40% with severe 3+ MR. Christa Labounty showed
7.47/34/179, troponin of 0.09, CK of 135, MB of 3, BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **], K+
was 5.3, serum tox was positive for tricyclics, otherwise
negative. She was given 60mg IV lasix as she still makes urine,
SL nitro x 2, and levofloxacin to cover for CAP.
.
On the floor, her initial VS were: T-96.5, HR-133, BP-128/97,
RR-38, 100% on NRB. She continues to complain of shortness of
breath, despite stable oxygen saturations. She also continues to
complain of abdominal pain/heaviness, and generally feels
overwhelmed with her illness and doing the PD at home, has also
not been having as regular of bowel movements at home recently.
Also of note, she was recently on a prednisone taper for a lupus
flare, where she experiences vague symptoms, including SOB,
arthritis, abdominal heaviness.
.

----------------
2010-08-18 00:00:00 TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-08-18 00:00:00,
the heart rate is now higher and LVEF is slightly lower.
.
2010-08-18 00:00:00 CXR (PA and Lat): FINDINGS: In comparison with the study
of 2010-08-18 00:00:00, there are bilateral pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis and engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent
with the clinical impression of volume overload. The possibility
of supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded and would
have to be made on clinical grounds.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Volume Overload/Shortness of Breath: in the setting of
missing PD sessions, likely due to volume overload, especially
in the context of the findings on CXR, and echo.  Also possible
is PNA.  We consulted the renal team and continued Ms. Labounty on
PD while in the ICU on an aggressive schedule to remove extra
fluid.  She was started on empiric treatment for CAP with
levofloxacin.  While she was afebrile on the floor and had a
normal WBC, she had a fever in the ED and it was decided to
continue empiric treatment of possible CAP as an outpatient for
a total of 5 days (last dose to be 2010-08-18 00:00:00) of 750 mg
levofloxacin daily.

.

#) High INR: Pt has h/o PEs and has anti-phospholipid Ab
syndrome with no evidence of bleed.  It peaked at 6.0 and rather
than give Vitamin K, we decided to let it drift back down by
holding coumadin.  The INR was 3.6 on the day of discharge, and
she is followed by the coumadin clinic at UPMCE.  We have
contactChrista Labounty the Christa Labounty clinic for her f/u.  As their recs, she should
take 3.75 mg tonight, and 5 mg starting tomorrow (2010-08-18 00:00:00) until
she hears back from the UPMCE.  She will need
to F/U by getting an INR check on UPMCE, 2010-08-18 00:00:00, which will need
to be faxed to UPMCE coumadin clinic.

.

#) ESRD on PD: As per renal, we continued her PD in house, and
she will be returning to her regular home regimen as an
outpatient.
We have continued her senna and colace as an outpatient to help
with constipation, and have tried miralax while in house.  She
also came in with a positive amitryptiline when she arrived to
UPMCE and her dose was held.  We rechecked a level and it is
still pending. We told pt not to take any more of this
medication until this result came back and she followed up with
her PCP.
.

#) Tachycardia: Pt has been in sinus tach since arriving on the
floor.  TSH nl.  Has baseline tachy, possibly 2010-08-18 00:00:00 anemia.  Pt
would decline blood products.  Given her low EF on echo, it was
decided to start labetalol 100 mg POBID for her which has helped
bring both her BP and heart rate down.

.

#) Anemia: patient with recent HCT of around 25, however in the
end of 2010-08-18 00:00:00 HCT was around 30, drop thought to be due to
hemolysis.  Hemolysis labs were rechecked which were negative.
Her Hct was stable for us around 25.  We kept an active T/S, and
the plan is to continue her darbe123 Any St. Q2 weeks.

.

#) Hypertension: we continued her home medications, and given
her EF of 40% with 3+ MR, and her persistent hypertension, we
continued her home dose of lisinopril, amlodipine, and added
labetalol 100 mg POBID.

.

#) Depressed EF (40%) on TTE, with 3+ MR.
- Continue labetalol.
- Arrange for cardiology f/u with Dr. Labounty next week.
.

#) SLE: Continued her home plaquenil

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Volume overload/shortness of breath


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to UPMCE
because you were short of breath from having too much fluid on
after suboptimal peritoneal dialysis sessions for a few days.
While you were here, we were able to aggressively use peritoneal
dialysis to take off fluid to make you more comfortable.  Your
blood pressure and heart rate were also high, and we have
started a new medication for you to help with this problem.

PLEASE MAKE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS:
1) Please START taking labetalol 100 mg by mouth two times a day
2) Today (2010-08-18 00:00:00), please take 3.75 mg of coumadin.
3) For the next two days (Friday, 2010-08-18 00:00:00 and Saturday, 2010-08-18 00:00:00),
please take 5 mg of coumadin.
4) Go back to your regular dose of coumadin on 2010-08-18 00:00:00 (Sunday).
5) Do not take your amitriptyline. We have drawn a level and if
it comes back normal you can continue taking it. Your PCP can
let you know when this level comes back or you can call to find
out if you can start taking this medication again.

PLEASE CONTINUE THE FOLLOWING FOR YOUR PERITONEAL DIALYSIS
1) 5 cycles of 1500 milliliter fill, 1.5% dextrose alternating
with 2.5% dextrose; 1 day dwell of 1.5% dextrose with 1500
milliliter fill.
2) PLEASE CALL 123 Any St. peritoneal dialysis
center.


Followup Instructions:
INR CHECK
Please go for a blood draw to check your INR on 123 Any St., 2010-08-18 00:00:00,
and have the results faxed to the UPMCE UPMCE
Coumadin Clinic (test@mail.com.
