Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year old male with past medical history of
diverticulosis and melanoma who presented with with altered
mental status after a fall. The exact details of what happened
are a bit unclear as patient is not able to give a full history
but on 2013-01-19 00:00:00 the patient was shoveling snow when he sustained
a fall and struck his head. He managed to get inside and call
his daughter who came to check on him and found him very
confused but able to speak with blood visible outside and inside
the house. She brought the patient to the ED where he had head
CT revealing intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages and
neurosurgery was consulted. They recommended no acute
neurosurgical management at the time. Patient was extremely
confused and becoming less responsive at that time so he was
emergently intubated for airway protection and admitted to the
neurosurgery ICU. Of night, he had a CT of his chest, abdomen,
and pelvis that night, which was remarkable for signs of
aspiration as well as some free air in his abdomen. His
abdominal exam was benign and surgery evaluated him feeling
there were no signs of an acute surgical abdomen or need for
intervention.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multi-compartment intracranial hemorrhage, including
extensive left
parafalcine and left convexity mixed density subdural hematoma,
left inferior frontal hemorrhagic contusion, and scattered
bifrontal subarachnoid blood.  There is mass effect upon the
left cerebral hemisphere, with 1-cm rightward
shift of midline structures, and some evidence of encroachment
upon the left suprasellar cistern.
2. Left frontal subgaleal hematoma, with underlying nondisplaced
skull
fracture.

CT Cspine 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION: No apparent fracture or traumatic malalignment
involving the
cervical spine. Degenerative changes are noted, worse from C5
through T1.
Note that motion artifact somewhat limits evaluation of the
lower cervical
spine, and if there is high clinical suspicion for injury,
repeat CT or MR
could be considered for further evaluation.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral dependent pulmonary opacities, most compatible with
aspiration.
2. Low positioning of the endotracheal tube, which is positioned
2 cm above the carina, and could be withdrawn for optimal
positioning.
3. Free intraperitoneal air, located anterior to the liver, in
the s123 Any St.
hilum, and tracking through the hiatal hernia defect into the
hiatal hernia sac. While highly worrisome for bowel perforation,
the source is unclear. If further evaluation is desired, CT with
enteric contrast could be considered.
4. Indeterminate 2.1 cm right adrenal mass. If clinically
indicated, when
patient is stable, dedicated adrenal MRI or CT could be
performed.
5. Small amount of free fluid tracking into the right inguinal
hernia.
6. Extensive aortic atherosclerosis.
7. Degenerative changes throughout the spine, with no evidence
of fracture.

Head CT 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally changed multi-compartment intracranial hemorrhage,
as detailed above. Blood is now seen layering in the right
lateral ventricle. Mass effect upon the left cerebral hemisphere
is stable, with persistent sulcal effacement, 1 cm rightward
shift of midline structures, and minimal
encroachment upon the left suprasellar cistern without Dynisha
Kanner herniation. This is unchanged from prior study.
2. Nondisplaced skull fracture, as 123 Any St.usly demonstrated.

Head CT 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to the study from 1820H and, in particular, the
study from 1355H (both 2013-01-19 00:00:00), there has been mild interval
increase in the subdural hematoma layering along the left
cerebral convexity and that leaflet of the tentorium cerebelli,
as well as the intraventricular and left more than right
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Evolving large left frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
3. Unchanged mass effect with stable 10mm rightward shift of
midline
structures.
4. No evidence of 2013-01-19 00:00:00 herniation or acute infarction.


Head CT 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in density of left subdural hemorrhage.
Interval mild
prominence of the right extra-axial space concerning for
post-traumatic
hygroma.
2. Subdural hematoma layering along the tentorium cerebelli,
similar to
prior. Similar intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the
occipital Jabarius Cristler of bilateral lateral ventricles.
3. Similar bilateral foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
4. Evolving large left frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
5. Evolving areas of hypodensities in bilateral frontal lobes;
evolving
contusions.
6. Similar mass effect with a similar approximately 7 mm
rightward shift of midline structures.
7. No evidence of hydrocephalus.

CXR 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of 2013-01-19 00:00:00, there is
diffusely increased prominence of pulmonary vessels consistent
with vascular congestion. In the appropriate clinical setting,
the possibility of superimposed pneumonia, especially on the
left, must be considered. Large hiatal hernia is again seen.

CXR 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct
comparison
with the next preceding similar study of 2013-01-19 00:00:00. Again
there is
perivascular haze indicative of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Basal
densities exist more marked on the left than on the right. Again
as mentioned on preceding study, consideration for superimposed
pneumonic infiltrates in this patient with CHF must be
considered. There is no significant interval change during the
latest 24 hours examination interval.

ECHO 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: small, hyperdynamic left ventricle with severe
outflow tract obstruction.

CT Chest/abd 2013-01-19 00:00:00:
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolution of free intraperitoneal air.
2. Very large hiatal hernia containing stomach and transverse
bowel loop.
3. New bilateral pleural effusions. Nearly resolved bibasillar
opacities
most likely represented aspiration.
4. Extensive aortic atherosclerosis.
5. Indeterminate 2.1 cm right adrenal mass. Again, if no
comparison
available and clinically indicated, when patient is stable,
dedicated renal MR could be performed.

2013-01-19 00:00:00 CXR:
FINDINGS: There is a new ET tube with tip 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach and is coiled in the lower
thorax in the hiatal hernia.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
There continues to be vascular plethora. There are small
bilateral effusions but these are less apparent than on the
study from one hour prior. Overall the aeration is slightly
improved.

2013-01-19 00:00:00 CT Head:
1. Little change in bilateral chronic subdural, left
subarachnoid and left
occipital Jabarius Cristler hemorrhage. Slight increase in subdural
hemorrhage along the falx.

2013-01-19 00:00:00 CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. In comparison to an exam obtained the day prior, there are
new
hypodensities involving bilateral anterior cerebral artery and
left middle
cerebral artery territories, with significant cerebral edema and
mass effect as demonstrated by increased rightward shift of
normally midline structures. These findings are concerning for
acute ischemia possibly secondary to vasospasm.
2. Evolving right frontal hematoma. Stable appearance of
ventricular
hemorrhage as demonstrated by layering of blood products in the
occipital Jabarius Cristler of the right lateral ventricle.
3. Small bilateral chronic subdural hematomas.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 89 year old male with past medical history of
melanoma, HTN, and diverticulosis, who presented from home on
2013-01-19 00:00:00 s/p fall. Per review of OMR, the patient was shoveling
snow on 2013-01-19 00:00:00 when he fell and hit his head. He managed to get
inside and call his daughter who came to check on him and found
him very confused but able to speak with blood visible outside
and inside the house. She brought the patient to the ED where he
had head CT revealing intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages
and neurosurgery was consulted. They recommended no acute
neurosurgical management at the time. Patient was extremely
confused and becoming less responsive at that time so he was
emergently intubated for airway protection and admitted to the
neurosurgery ICU. Of note, he had a CT of his chest, abdomen,
and pelvis that night, which was remarkable for signs of
aspiration as well as some free air in his abdomen. His
abdominal exam was benign and surgery evaluated him feeling
there were no signs of an acute surgical abdomen or need for
intervention.
.
In the SICU, he was intubated for one night and was extubated
and sent to the neuro step-down unit. He had sputum cultures
sent while intubated, which grew klebsiella. Therefore, when he
had fevers on 2013-01-19 00:00:00 and increased respiratory distress he was
started on cefepime/vancomycin for concern of pneumonia. On the
day prior to transfer he developed tachypnea and increased O2
requirments. Therefore he was given IV furosemide for a total
diuresis of about 1L negative. A medicine C/S was called and he
was transferred to Medicine for further evaluation.
.
On the floor, the patient was somnolent but arousable to sternal
rub. He was started on Flagyl empirically for aspiration
pneumonia, and the respiratory therapist noted that he was
having difficulty handling his secretions. He was given one dose
of Hydralazine IV for SBP > 160. At approximately 4 am, routine
VS demonstrated hypoxia to 60% on RA. He was placed on a NRB, to
which his sats increased to 100%, and ABG and CXR were ordered.
The MICU was called regarding likely transfer, and as the
patient developed increasing respiratory distress, a code blue
was called for emergent intubation. He transiently dropped his
SBP to the 60s after intubation, which increased to the 100s
with IVFs. He was then transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, we he was taken off sedation, but did not have any
purposeful movements.  A head CT right after the event showed no
major changed from initial scan.  Neuro was consulted and a
second CT was obtained 24 hrs after intubation.  This CT showed
severe bilateral ischemic strokes, likely related to vasospasm
from the initial bleed.  Given his poor prognosis, the family
decide to pursue only comfort care and he was terminally
extubated on 2013-01-19 00:00:00.  His time of death was 13:40 approximately
1-2 hrs after extubation.  His family was informed and declined
autopsy.
