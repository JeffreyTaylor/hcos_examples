2. Osteoarthritis.
3. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
4. Chronic back pain secondary to spinal stenosis.
5. Lumbar radiculopathy.
6. Known coronary artery disease with EKG evidence of prior

4. Colace 100 mg t.i.d.
5. Lisinopril unknown dose.
6. Neurontin 300 mg q.h.s.
7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual prn.
8. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

Echocardiogram obtained in 2009-11-29 00:00:00 revealed left
ventricular ejection fraction 60%, dilated ascending aorta
and mild aortic stenosis and mild mitral annular
calcification.

Catheterization obtained revealed LVEDP of 17, 90% left main
stenosis, 80% proximal right coronary artery stenosis.  Due
to the anatomy of the patient's lesions, an intra-aortic
balloon pump was inserted in the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory and he was taken to the Coronary Care Unit
preoperatively.

Laboratory values upon admission to the hospital were
unremarkable with the exception of a creatinine of 1.2.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  Was
also unremarkable.

Patient was taken to the operating room on 2009-11-29 00:00:00
by Dr. Jesusmanuel Bascon, cardiothoracic surgeon.  Patient
underwent coronary artery bypass graft x3 with a LIMA to the
LAD, saphenous vein to the right coronary, and a saphenous
vein to the obtuse marginal.  Postoperatively, he was
transported in good condition from the operating room to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.

The night of surgery the patient was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and extubated successfully.  On postoperative day
one, he was off vasoactive drips.  He was hemodynamically
stable.  His intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued.  He
was begun on Lasix as well as a beta blocker.

Later in the day on postoperative day one, the patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry
floor in good condition.

In postoperative day two, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was transfused 1 unit of packed
red blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.  He was begun with
Physical Therapy and cardiac rehabilitation.  He continued on
Lopressor and Lasix.  Patient continued to progress over the
next couple of days with cardiac rehabilitation, increasing
mobility, and ambulating with less assistance.  Patient did
receive a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells on
postoperative day two to postoperative day three for a drop
in hematocrit.

On postoperative day four, patient continued to work with
aggressive physical therapy.  He was still not completely
independent at that time, but was progressing in satisfactory
condition.  Today, on postoperative day six, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable, and ready to be discharged
to home.

Patient's condition today is as follows:  He is afebrile.
His weight is 68.4 kg today, which is just about his
preoperative weight of 68 kg.  His wounds are clean, dry, and
intact.  His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  He has 1+
pedal edema bilaterally.

Most recent laboratory values include a white blood cell
count of 9.4 thousand, hematocrit of 30%, and a platelet
count of 149,000.  INR today is 1.4.  Chemistries reveal a
sodium of 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 104, CO2 26, BUN 27,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 105.

Most recent chest x-ray from 2009-11-29 00:00:00, which was
unremarkable.  The patient is scheduled for another chest
x-ray prior to discharge today, but the results of that are
still pending.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.h.s.
5. Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Quinine 260 mg q.h.s.
7. Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days.
8. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. x7 days.
9. Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.3-4h. prn pain.
10. AndroGel 1% patch q.d.
11. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
