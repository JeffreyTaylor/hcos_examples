Labs on discharge:


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old woman with DM2, morbid obesity, PMR recently
restarted on steroids admitted with hyperglycemia, diarrhea,
tachycardia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, all now improved.
.
#. Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Syndrome vs DKA/IDDM2: Patient
presenting with elevated blood sugars, hyponatremia and
hypovolemia consistent with HHS. AG 12 on arrival but also has
acute on chronic renal failure. Unclear 123 Any St.itant but most
likely related to recent diarrhea/infection in addition to
steroid use. Of note, patient also missed her PM dose of insulin
prior to presentation. GIB and ACS also possible 123 Any St.itants.
Has mild leukocytosis but no fever although steroids may be
masking a fever. UA and CXR negative for PNA. Cardiac enzymes
were negative. Patient was continued on her home insulin
regimen.
.
#. Tachycardia: resolved. Likely related to dehydration +/-
infection although afebrile. Not hypotensive but could also have
component of adrenal insufficiency. Could also be secondary to
slow GIB given h/o CA and guaaic positive stool although HCT
Montemarano around baseline. During hospitalization, TSH wnl and
tachycardia resolved with 2L IVF in the ICU.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: Likely related to renal failure in setting of
ACE and spironolactone use +/- dietary indiscretion. Given
diarrhea, would expect hypokalemia but K more likely to be
elevated on ACE in setting of hypovolemia. Now improved and did
not have ECG changes suggesting was not rapid rise. On
discharge, potassium was 4.5. Patient will hold her ACEi and
aldactone until discussion with her PCP. Jme Montemarano BP here was well
controlled off these medications.
.
#. Hyponatremia: Initial corrected sodium 129 (122), now
improved with IVF resuscitation suggesting most likely
hypovolemic hyponatremia.
.
#. Diarrhea: Pt reports several days of diarrhea which was
attributed to azathioprine. 2008-11-09 00:00:00 be med effect vs infectious. CT
A/P without evidence for colitis. Patient will hold her
azathioprine until discussed with her rheumatologist.
.
#. Montemarano: Cr 1.8 from baseline 1.5. Likely prerenal vs ATN. Has
improved back to baseline with IVF in ED.
.
#. PMR: On high dose prednisone. ? should be on PCP Jme Montemarano as
outpatient, will not start now given Montemarano. Did start PPI given
recent GERD symptoms and high dose prednisone use.
.
#. Anemia: Hct on presentation 35, likely hemoconcentrated from
hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea. Dropped to 30, which was
likely dilutional from 123 Any St.us baseline 32-34. Faintly guaiac +
stool most likely 2008-11-09 00:00:00 hemorrhoids. Otherwise, no evidence of
bleeding.
.
#. HTN: Held all meds except metoprolol and BP remainded stable.
.
#. Leaving AMA: Patient requested to leave AMA during her MICU
visit. MICU staff were able to convience her to stay after 2
hours of discussion. 5 minutes after arrival to floor she became
angry and requested discharge AMA. I discussed with her the
risks of leaving AMA. She was cometent and was discharged AMA.
Her friend accompanied her. I asked her to stop her aldactone
and resume Lasix and ACEi (lisinopril) and see her PCP Jme Montemarano on
her way out.
