None.


History of Present Illness:
69 y/o female w/ HTN, DM2, ESRD (on peritoneal dialysis) who
presents to the EU w/complaints of itching, lightheadedness.
Found to be hypotensive with SBP's to the 70's. The patient was
recently discharged 2009-07-17 00:00:00 for peritonitis. Treated initially with
cefotaxime and vanco intraperitoneally. Culture grew coag (-)
staph and micrococcus. Continued tx. w/ vanc and had quick
resolution of presenting symptoms including abd pain, N/V/D.
Felt well on discharge. On Wednesday 2009-07-17 00:00:00 she had her Vancomycin
dose. This morning she woke up and felt itchy and lightheaded
upon standing. No loc, sob or chest pain. Denies abdominal pain.
+ vomiting on the way to the EU x 1. Denies F/C. Reports taking
care of her own PD at home, but has not weighed herself
recently. She feels subjectively that she took off too much
fluid. She denies recently cloudy or bloody effluent.

Now presents to the EU w/ Hypotension. SBP in the 70's, tachy
(108), hypothermic (T=96.3). Given 25 mg Benadryl IV, Vanco 1gm
IV, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV, and Dex 4mg IV. Left femoral line
placed. Admitted to UPMCE for further management of hypotension,
r/o sepsis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69 y/o female w/ HTN, DMII, ESRD req Peritoneal Dialysis
who p/w hypotension, elevated WBC and Lactate=4.2 transferred
initially to the UPMCE for hypotension/sepsis mgmt.

1. Hypotension- Hypotension leading to hypoperfusion w/ elevated
Lactate on admission. Possible etiologies inclue hypovolemic
(dehydration, PD excess volume loss) vs distributive (sepsis,
adrenal insufficiency). h/o recurrent peritonitis, most recently
1 week ago. It was suspected that she might have an infection
and she was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime, metronidazole
and ceftriaxone. As she responded to fluid resuscitation, she
was stable and transferred to the UPMCE service. She was tested
for adrenal insufficiency with a cosyntropin stimulation test
which was negative. At this time, all her antibiotics were
discontinued with a negative peritoneal cytology for infection
with the exception of Ceftazidime which she received
intraperitoneally with her peritoneal dialysis. Her blood
cultures remained pending and she never spiked a temperature. It
was believed that her initial hypotension was a response to
having dialyzed off too much fluid at home which the patient
states occurred. Her blood pressure returned to the 140-160s and
she was restarted on her outpatient medication of Norvasc 10 mg
QD.

2. ID- The patient was recieving Vanco for coag neg. staph on
recent culture prior to re-admission. Rec'd last dose on 2009-07-17 00:00:00,
and one dose in EU. She did not receive subsequent doses of
vancomycin as her random level was elevated. The metronidazole
500mg q8 and ceftriaxone 1g q24 were discontinued and she
remained on the ceftazidime until the day of discharge at which
time it was discontinued as peritonitis was unlikely. Her
elevated lactate was believed to be secondary to her chronic
renal failure.

3. Itching- Likely secondary to Uremia. Also has mild asterixis
on physical exam. BUN not markedly elevated (38), but Cr 10.3.
Tbili normal; Liver enzymes normal. No new meds to suggest
potential drug rxn. She received benadryl 25mg q4 prn and Sarna
lotion QID prn and her itching resolved.

4. ESRD- Requires chronic Peritoneal Dialysis. Performs PD
herself at home. She continued with PD and was followed closely
by renal. She was discharged on a different PD regimen with 2 of
2.5% dextrose and 1 of 1.5% dextrose to decrease the likelihood
of removing too much fluid as was believed to be the cause of
her presenting symptoms.

5. Hypercalcemia- h/o elevated PTH, likely secondary
hyperparathyroidism from ESRD. s/p partial parathyroidectomy.
Calcium elevated on admission. Was 123 Any St.usly on calcitonin, but
not currently on her med list. She was instructed to continue
the use of her Hectrol which she takes at home.

6. Anemia: Baseline HCT 28-30, currently 33. Likely anemia
secondary to ESRD/chronic dx. Recieves EPO qMonday. Guaiac + on
admission, so upper vs. lower GI bleed also a possibility (no
prior history). No reported h/o hematuria, hematemesis. She was
then guaic negative and her hematrocit stablized.

7. DMII: 123 Any St.usly required insulin, but reportedly has been
off hypoglycemic agents since she lost 40 pounds w/ dialysis,
per patient. On chart review, BG's have ranged in 100-200 range
on 123 Any St.us admissions. She continued on a sliding Scale insulin
regimen.

8. On the second to last day before discharge, the patient
developed diarrhea, no melena. She was given Imodim and stool
cultures, ova and parasites, and a C.difficile toxin were sent
and are still pending. She will be notified if they are positive
and continued on metronidazole to treat the infection.
