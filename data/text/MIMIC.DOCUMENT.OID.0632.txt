Bipap


History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent
UTI on tetracycline immunosup123 Any St.n, ESRD s/p CRT in 2010-06-18 00:00:00, who
presents with acute onset of dyspnea.
.
The patient was recently admitted from 2010-06-18 00:00:00/09 for
pyelonephritis and e. coli bacteremia.  She presented with
weakness and fever. She was on Zosyn and ciprofloxacin until
sensitivies returned and then switched to oral ciprofloxacin.
She was on tetracycline for UTI suppression by her ID MD, Dr.
Sanon.  She was discharged with 2 week course of ciprofloxacin.
Also, Cr elevated and felt to be prerenal secondary to
bacteremia but also with some component of ATN, which resolved
with IVFs.  Diuretics slowly restarted upon discharge.
.
The patient went to her appointment with her NP this morning.
Today, her wt was noted to be up 28 lbs from 2010-06-18 00:00:00. The plan
was to increase lasix from 80 mg UPMCE to 120 mg qAM and 80 mg QPM
and to follow up with Dr. Sanon on 2010-06-18 00:00:00.  After her
appointment, she went home, and around noon, while walking, she
felt acute onset of dyspnea.  She notes increased wt gain since
her recent discharge from UPMCE on 2010-06-18 00:00:00, but notes that she is
on increased doses of her lasix.  She also denies any medication
noncompliance.  Denies dietary indiscretions, but has been
eating only chicken soup which her daughters prepare for her (1
tsp salt in each batch).  She also drinks 2 glasses of cranberry
juice, cup of coffee, and cup of tea.  She also has been eating
many low salt saltine crackers and ginger ale per her daughter.
Charmella Sanon daughter visited her the night prior to discharge, and noted
that her mom wsa tired and weak but not SOB.  Today, though, the
patient called her daughter and complained of "gasping for air"
and then she was instructed to call 911.  The patient then
presented to UPMCE ED.  She states she has had subjective fevers
at night for the last 2 days with a cough.  Chest pain with
presentation to ED, but now resolved. No abdominal pain, N/V or
diarrhea.  She has been making good UOP at home.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T(not recorded) HR 96  BP 147/93  RR 44
O2 36% --> then 60% on NRB with good pleth per ED.  Labs were
drawn, significant for leukocytosis 13, Cr 2.3.  Blood culture x
2 and urine culture pending.  VBG 7.24/70/36/31.  UA negative.
EKG and portable CXR obtained.  PE c/w with fluid overload with
bilateral LE pitting edema.  Pt was confirmed DNR/DNI by patient
and daughter.  She was placed on bipap (settings FiO2 100%, PS
10, PEEP 5) with O2 sat 100%.
.
In the ED, she was started on NTG SL x 1 then NTG gtt for
elevated BP (SBP 170-213s) and lasix 80 mg IV x 1 was given
after foley placement.  Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1 and levofloxacin
750 mg IV x 1 given.  She was given 2 mg IV morphine x 1 for abd
pain and repeat 80 mg IV lasix given.  Per ED verbal signout,
she had made 500 cc of UOP.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chest pain, n/v, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain
currently.

Studies:
1. pCXR: Diffuse bilateral lung opacities likely represent
pneumonia
although an element of CHF is also possible.
.
2. Renal transplant u/s: Persistent elevated resistive indices
in the renal transplant, with interval development of forward
diastolic flow. No evidence of perinephric fluid collection or
hydronephrosis
.
TTE 2010-06-18 00:00:00
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2010-06-18 00:00:00,
pulmonary hypertension is identified. Aortic regurgitation is no
longer seen.
.
2010-06-18 00:00:00 RUQ U/S
FINDINGS: No focal abnormality is seen within the liver and
there is no
biliary dilatation seen. The extrahepatic common duct measures
0.4 cm. The
gallbladder is normal with no stones identified and no signs of
cholecystitis. No gallbladder wall thickening is seen and there
is no pericholecystic fluid. A small right pleural effusion is
seen but there is no ascites in the right upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION:
1. No gallstones and no signs of cholecystitis.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
.
CXR 2010-06-18 00:00:00
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS: Heart size
remains mildly
enlarged and mural calcifications are again noted along the
aortic arch. Right lung base consolidation is improved, with
improved definition of the right hemidiaphragm. Likely bilateral
small pleural effusions persist, along with left retrocardiac
likely atelectasis. No new pneumothorax is seen. A right upper
extremity PICC tip is again seen terminating in the right
subclavian vein region.
IMPRESSION: Right lung base consolidation is slightly improved.
Small
likely bilateral pleural effusions persist.

Micro:
Blood cx 2010-06-18 00:00:00: negative
Urine cx 2010-06-18 00:00:00: negative
Respiratory viral cx 2010-06-18 00:00:00: negative



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: Clinical picture most consistent with CHF
exacerbation with flash pulmonary edema in setting of
hypertensive urgency.  Initially required nitro gtt and placed
on bipap in ED and admitted to the MICU for further management.
Also presented with low grade fever/infiltrates/sob and
therefore could not rule out pneumonia and she was treated with
vanc/zosyn for possible HAP given recent admission.  She was
diuresed aggressively in the ICU with Lasix 160 mg IV/500 mg IV
Diuril combination and was 2L negative on 2010-06-18 00:00:00 and continued to
be negative.  She required 2 doses of diuretics per day and
nitroglycerin gtt discontinued early on arrival to ICU.
Electrolytes were stable, however creatinine bumped to 3.7 from
2.3 and therefore diuresis was held on 2010-06-18 00:00:00.  Diuretics were
restarted on 2010-06-18 00:00:00 at home dose of 80mg lasix UPMCE when Cr
decreased to 2.8 which was close to patient's baseline.  Her
respiratory status continued to improve and she was weaned down
from 4L NC to 2L NC with sats in high 90s.  While working with
PT on 2010-06-18 00:00:00 she was noted to desat with ambulation to 85% on 3L
NC and therefore it was felt that a short course of rehab with
continued diuresis and respiratory care would be necessary.  She
continued to diurese well to lasix, however her weight remained
stable and therefore metolazone was added on 2010-06-18 00:00:00, 5mg daily
with am lasix.  Her Cr remained stable.  On transfer to the
floor her antibiotics were changed to Levaquin and she completed
a total of 10 days, last day 2010-06-18 00:00:00.

2. Fever/infiltrate/sob: febrile at home, tmax 100 in the ICU.
espiratory viral screen was negative as was Legionella urinary
antigen. Treated for HAP as above with Vanc/Zosyn that was
transitioned to levaquin on the medicine floor. Beta glucan was
sent given she is immunosuppressed and this was negative.  She
completed 10 days of abx on 2010-06-18 00:00:00. Her WBC was normal at 8.3 on
the day of discharge and she remained afebrile her entire stay
on the floor.

3. ESRD s/p transplant: renal transplant followed. She was
continued on her home regimen of immunosuppressants and ESRD
medications. Held sodium bicarbonate as HCO3 rose in setting of
diuressis. Transplant ultrasound normal. Cr on day of discharge
was 2.8 and patient's baseline is 2.4-3. Her UOP remained
stable. She has follow up with her transplant nephrologist Dr.
Sanon next week.
.
4. DM1: Patient was continued on home lantus and HISS, however
lantus dose the decreased to 7 units qhs while in the ICU.  On
the floor her FS were elevated to 200s and this was uptitrated
to 10 units qhs. Suspect the elevation was in setting of
increased prednisone dose to treat gout flare and will likely
need to be decreased once she resumes her home dose of 5mg
prednisone on 2010-06-18 00:00:00

5. Hypertension: goal SBP 140s, Nifedipine CR was increased to
90 mg daily while in the ICU and she was continued on home dose
of metoprolol.  While in ICU her BP dropped with increased
nifedipine dose to 89/44 in addition to diuresis and sitting up
to eat, so her dose was decreased back to nifedipine 60 mg
daily. Her BP remained stable on the floor. If it increases
again may consider increasing nifedipine to 90mg once again.

6. Anemia: Patient's baseline Hct ranges 25-30. Felt to be
anemia of chronic disease.  Hct slowly trended down to 22 and
she received one unit pRBCs on 2010-06-18 00:00:00 with appropriate bump. Hct
remained stable at 27 the day of discharge. She was maintained
on epo.

7. Hyperlipidemia: continued simvastatin

8.  Frequent UTIs: remained on tetracycline suppression

9. Obesity: sibutramine held while in the hospital and may be
resumed on discharge.

10. Gout: she was maintained on allopurinol, renally dosed. On
2010-06-18 00:00:00 the patient began complaining of increased pain, swelling
and erythema of her right hand, particularly in her thumb and
first digit. This was felt to be consistent with her typical
gout flare and her prednisone was increased to 40mg daily for a
5 day burst.  She will need 3 more days of 40mg and then will
need to resume her daily immunosuppression dose of 5mg daily.

11. Access: PICC was placed for IV access for antibiotics. This
was removed 2010-06-18 00:00:00 prior to discharge.
