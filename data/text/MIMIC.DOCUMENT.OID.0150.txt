2010-05-15 00:00:00 TTE Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly elongated. There is mild mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: 2010-05-15 00:00:00 13:11:16
Atrial fibrillation. Compared to tracing #1 no change.
.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: 2010-05-15 00:00:00 22:49:52
Normal sinus rhythm. Evidence of prior anteroseptal myocardial
infarction.
Compared to tracing #2 atrial fibrillation is no longer present.



Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo F hx SVT, Afib p/w palpitations and dyspnea, noted to be
in recurrent AFib.
.
# Afib - recent cardioversion for AFib, now returns with
recurrence. Rate is fairly well controlled. Thyroid studies wnl.
 Patient underwent DC cardioversion, but had recurrent atrial
fibrillation post-procedure.  She was started on flecainide
after attempt at cardioversion with low dose beta-blocker.  She
converted back into sinus rhythm that same night.  She was
discharged on flecainide 50mg po bid and metoprolol.  She is to
scheduled outpatient exercise (non-imaging) stress test in one
week after discharge from the hospital.  She has outpatient
follow-up for possible EP study with Dr. Isobel Turse in the next
couple of weeks.  She was discharged with Isobel Turse Portela of hearts
monitor.  She had TTE Echo with mitral regurgitation and
prolapse and was instructed to take pre-procedure antibiotics
for any dentalwork.  PCN allergy so given prescription for
clindamycin.
.
# Dyspnea - most likely related to AFib, and resolved on
admission after bring her heart rate down.  No evidence of
pulmonary edema or infiltrate on CXR. D-dimer negative.  No JVD,
and bedside echo in ED without pericardial effusion.  Breathing
comfortably on room air throughout hospitalization.
.
# Dispo - patient was discharged to home with EP follow-up, Isobel Turse
of hearts monitor and stress test.
