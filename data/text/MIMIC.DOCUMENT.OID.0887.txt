Attending:Danet Grandstrand
Chief Complaint:
transferred from nursing home for respiratory failure and
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Deavila is a 66 yo man who was formerly DNR/DNI and "do
not hospitalize" in his USOH at UPMCE Rehab until the day of
admission. At rehab, he was found to have a Hct of 21 so was
transfused blood products at 10:00 AM. Starting at noon the
patient was reported to have dyspnea, wheezing, with increased
anxiety.  He then spiked a temp to 101.6, then to 104.  At the
NH, he was given nebs, tylenol, and Lasix 80 mg IV x 1.  The
patient then desatted to 84% on 5L NC.  Hematuria was also
noted.  Although he was 123 Any St.usly DNH, he was sent to the UPMCE
ED.  He was still febrile to 104, hypoxic, and hypotensive.  His
family was contactDarise Deavila and code status was reversed.
*
In the ED, the patient was intubated.  His BP improved. Lactate
was found to be 7, and a code sepsis was called.  RIJ was
placed, and 3 liters NS given.  He was also started on
vancomycin and unasyn.  The patient also received benadryl,
pepcid, solumedrol, and tylenol for the possibility that this
represented a transfusion reaction.  His BP then dropped, which
was possibly related to the propofol given, so levophed was
started.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  2006-03-15 00:00:00 3:01 PM
AP PORTABLE ERECT CHEST X-RAY: When compared with prior PA and
lateral views of the chest dated 2006-03-15 00:00:00, there is no
significant interval change. The cardiac silhouette is normal in
size. The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours
are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Within the left
lung apex, adjacent to the aortic knob, there is a stable 12-mm
nodule was 123 Any St.usly suggested to be a hamartoma. The left lung
base is not imaged secondary to overlying cardiac device. There
are no infiltrates, consolidations, or effusions within the
imaged lungs. Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
No acute cardiopulmonary disease. Twelve-mm left apical lung
mass, which is stable since 2006-03-15 00:00:00. It could represent
a hamartoma, as 123 Any St.usly described. However, a slow growing
metastatic lesion cannot be ruled out.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Deavila is a 66 yo man with a history of colon cancer,
chronic anemia due to intermittent rectal bleeding, PUD, HTN,
and AAA who presented from his nursing home with fever, hypoxia,
and hypotension after a blood transfusion.  Initially, given the
timeline (2-6 hours after transfusion) and association with
fever after blood transfusion, his presentation was thought to
be secondary to transfusion related lung injury (TRALI).
However, his CXR was unremarkable.  This suggested that another
process was responsible for his presenting symptoms of fever,
hypotension, and respiratory distress.
*
Given his hypotension, rising WBC count, and high lactate,
septic shock was more likely responsible for his presenting
symptoms.  An infectious source was never determined; however,
pneumonia vs. UTI with urosepsis seems most likley.  After
intubation, he was started on empiric therapy with vancomycin
and ceftriaxone.  He was also placed on sepsis protocol.
*
Prior to admission, the patient had an advanced directive of
DNR/DNI.  His family reversed this code status prior to
admission.  He was intubated on admission. After discussion with
the family, it was determined that the patient would be
extubated the day after admission, and not be re-intubated if in
any respiratory distress.  The following day, Mr. Deavila
was extubated.  He was tachypneic, and eventually went into
hypoxemic respiratory failure and passed away later that day.
The family was present during these events.
