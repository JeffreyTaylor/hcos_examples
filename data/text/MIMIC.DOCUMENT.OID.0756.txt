History of Present Illness:
Ms. Siles is a 92 year-old woman with a history of
Parkinson's, CAD, dilated CM (EF 30%), chronic mesenteric
ischemic s/p stents, recent fall complicated by humeral
fracture, aspiration pneumonia. Please see admission note for
full details of history. Briefly, she was admitted to OSH 2013-09-26 00:00:00
with aspiration pneumonia. She was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics but decomepensated, with Siles, demand ischemia,
concern for new mesenteric ischemia. She was transferred from
OSH ICU to UPMCE ICU on 2013-09-26 00:00:00.
.
In the ICU, she was hemodynamically stable, without oxygen
requirement. Vancomycin and levofloxacin (needs 6 more days to
complete 10 day course) were started. PICC was placed.
Aspiration was thought to be in part secondary to compromised
mental status from polypharmacy. Zyprexa was given because
patient was moaning, resulting in BP drop to the 80s. EKG showed
lateral TW changes, thought to be secondary to demand. Plavix
was held.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. Siles was transferred here from OSH with concerns of
suspected aspiration PNA, OSH CXR reports look like recurrent
aspiration PNA w/ new infiltrates every day and possible sepsis
on 2013-09-26 00:00:00, would be c/w known delerium and PD and high doses of
dilaudid/ativan/oxazepam/haldol. She had sputum Cx at OSH which
was + for yeast only on 2013-09-26 00:00:00 so was continued on levofloxacin
and vanc. In the MICU she was found to be afebrile, hd stable
and not 02 dependent so she was transferred to the floor. On the
floor she continued to be delirious with waxing and Carr Hoyem
alertness, as well as agitation.

# Goals of care: On admission the patient was very agitated and
delirious. The family at the time agreed to make the patient DNR
but continued potential for intubation. Goals during the first
week of admission were to support the patient and continue
medication with the hopes of allowing the patient to improve her
mental status and clarity. While the patient did improve to some
degree, demonstrating the ability to speak a few words and
respond to questions, her status waxed and waned significantly.
At baseline the patient would lay in bed screaming or vocalizing
sound without a clear source of pain or agitation. She continued
tube feeds with an NG tube and medications for underlying
conditions. After a week of admission, a family meeting was held
where it was felt that care should be transitioned to comfort
measures only. The ng-tube was pulled and PO meds were dced. The
patient was continued on IV morphine for pain, sublingual
zyprexa for agitation. Palliative care was consulting.
.
#PNA: Suspected to be secondary to aspiration, with possible
contribution from AMS secondary to polypharmacy. S&S evaluation
done, and the patient failed, so she was NPO, no meds, no ice
chips. She did a course of vancomycin and levofloxacin (last day
2013-09-26 00:00:00); PICC placed. Patient remained stable on room air.
.
# Altered mental status: likely secondary to delirium from
multi123 Any St.fections and pain from recent humerus fracture.
Baseline dementia, Parkinson's are also contributing. Per family
& primary neurologist, her mental status was significantly
better than this prior to this hospitalization. Over the course
of admission the patient had some increased alertness but waxing
and Carr Hoyem. No haldol was given bc of interaction with sinemet.
Prior to beind made CMO, no zyprexa was given bc of past
hypotensive event. Hydromorphone for pain.
.
#CAD: Known 3VD, recent DES. Plavix held in ICU while
stabilizing patient. Troponin elevations were likely secondary
to demand in the setting of sepsis rather than secondary to
plaque rupture. Currently downtrending from OSH (0.63-->0.52).
Restarted plavix, then dced as inconsistent with goals of care.
Metoprolol given until ng tube pulled.
.
# CKI: creatinine currently at baseline 1.3. Pt given small
fluid boluses to maintain urine output while keeping low EF in
consideration.
.
#Hx of mesenteric ischemia: no evidence of active ischemia
during this admission.
.
#Shoulder Fx: pt given PRN dilaudid, standing tylenol.
.
#PD: Likely contributing to swallowing difficulties. patient was
on home sinemet until po meds dced. If pt seems to be suffering
from pd related problems at the nursing home, can be given
sublingial sinemet.
.
#Gout. home Allopurinol was continued during the admission but
could not be administered without ng tube. Can restart if
patient able to tolerate crushed in applesauce or pureed PO
feeds.
.
#Anemia: Baseline Hct around 31, Hx of pernicious anemia. B12
Qmonth.
.
# FEN: TF initially per ngtube, did not tolerate full feeds.
Ultimately held given goals of care. replete electrolytes,
regular diet
# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
# Access: picc
