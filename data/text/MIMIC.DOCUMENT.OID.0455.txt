HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69 -year-old male
patient who was admitted to UPMCE - UPMCE Cindy
Mayton through the Emergency Department on 2010-12-05 00:00:00,
with increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had a
123 Any St.us hospitalization from 2010-12-05 00:00:00 through 2010-12-05 00:00:00
for which he was scheduled for an attempted apical
canalization.  However, he was found to have significant
aortic insufficiency and the procedure was aborted.

ThMayton was discharged home on 2010-12-05 00:00:00, without
diuretic and he was scheduled to undergo aortic valve
replacement on 2010-12-05 00:00:00 with Dr. [**Last Name (123 Any St.es) **].  On
admission to the hospital, the patient was noted to have a
chest x-ray which was significant for a right pleural
effusion as well as congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft times five in 2010-12-05 00:00:00.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction in 2010-12-05 00:00:00.
3.  Aortic stenosis with aortic insufficiency with a
calculated aortic valve area of 0.8-0.9.
4.  Asthma.
5.  ETOH abuse.  The patient states that last drink was on
2010-12-05 00:00:00.  The patient admits to smoking one pack a
day; however, has significantly higher smoking history in the
past, up to three to four packs a day per patient's family.
6.  The patient also has a history of multiple falls with
rib, ankle, and forearm fractures in the past, question if
this is related to his alcohol intake.
7.  He is status post radical prostatectomy in 2010-12-05 00:00:00.
8.  He is status post rectal polypectomy.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg po q day, Zoloft 50 mg
po q day, carvedilol 3.125 mg UPMCE, Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states that an intolerance to
sedation as this causes increased confusion and agitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission, the patient
was afebrile, his pulse was 56 in normal sinus rhythm, his
blood pressure was 107/50, respiratory rate 17, and on room
air oxygen saturation was 88%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat unremarkable.  Neck without jugular venous distention.
Chest with crackles one third of the way up on the right.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with a
grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen is obese,
positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities
are without edema and he had 2+ palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Extremities were warm.  Neurologically the patient's
cranial nerves II through XII were intact and he was alert
and oriented at the time of admission.  Strength was 2010-12-05 00:00:00.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Revealed a white blood cell count
of 7,700, hematocrit 34.6, platelet count 195,000.  Sodium
138, BUN of 26, creatinine of 1.0, and blood glucose of 85.
His electrocardiogram on admission to the hospital was normal
sinus rhythm with a left anterior fascicular block and a
right bundle branch block as well as left ventricular
hypertrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient received a
dental consult and he was cleared by the Dental Service to
undergo an aortic valve replacement.  On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the
patient went to the Operating Room with Dr. 123 Any St.es) 406**], where he underwent an aortic endarterectomy as well as
an aortic valve replacement with a #20 3.0 mm 123 Any St. valve.

Postoperatively the patient was transported from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on IV
milrinone.  His postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 35-40% which was an
improvement from preoperative ventricular function.  The
patient was on propofol; however, had increasing agitation,
was placed on dexmedetomidine for sedation at that time.  He
was weaned from the mechanical ventilator and extubated in
the evening on postoperative day one.

The patient had a cardiac index of greater than 3.0 on
Levophed and milrinone drip.  The milrinone was discontinued
on the evening of postoperative day one.  The patient
initially on extubation, was quite confused; however, no
agitated at that time.  The patient was started on
nitroprusside due to hypertension and oral Captopril was
added.  The patient continued to have a fair amount of chest
tube drainage from his pleural tube, of serosanguinous fluid
so that was left in for another couple of days.

The patient, on postoperative day two, required Haldol and
Ativan due to increasing confusion and agitation.  He
required soft restraints for patient safety.  The patient
wound up being oversedated due to his severe agitation,
requiring re-intubation because of respiratory compromise.
This occurred on 2010-12-05 00:00:00, which was postoperative day
five.  A Neurology Medicine consult was obtained at that time
and their conclusion was that this may be related to alcohol
withdrawal.  The patient had a CT scan of his head which was
negative.  Their thought is the alcohol withdrawal could be
contributing.  He could also have decreased clearance of all
the sedating medicines which he received for [** Location **]us
agitation due to renal and hepatic dysfunction.

On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient experienced rapid atrial
fibrillation which was treated with Lopressor.  The patient
was not given amiodarone at that time because he has a
history of slow heart rate as well as questionable liver
function due to his alcohol history.  The patient was
converted to normal sinus rhythm; however, had intermittent
pauses without appropriate capture of the pacemaker via his
epicardial wires.

The patient was started on postoperative day five on tube
feedings, the day he was re-intubated.  He continued to have
copious endotracheal tube secretions with his re-intubation.
His sputum was sent for culture which was found to have
Enterobacter and he was started on levofloxacin at that time.
The patient extubated himself later that evening and
remained confused and extremely agitated.  He was restarted
on Haldol and Ativan.

The patient require aggressive pulmonary toilet, continued to
have respiratory acidosis; however, was unable to stay
extubated.  On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient was reintubated due
to significant hypercarbia and respiratory distress,
respiratory acidosis.  He had required a fair amount of
sedation a couple of days leading up to that due to his
profound agitation, questionably related to alcohol
withdrawal.  At the time of the reintubation, he was found to
have thick tan secretions, although his repeat cultures were
negative.  Pulmonary toilet was continued, aggressive
diuresis was continued, and tube feeds were resumed.

The patient was extubated again on 2010-12-05 00:00:00.  At that time
his mental status had improved, felt to be questionable
resolving encephalopathy.  He had some intermittent
confusion, but much less agitation.  He was receiving some
Haldol.  The patient was continued on tube feeds via
nasogastric tube.  On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient underwent a
swallowing evaluation by the Speech Therapy Department.
Since he did not pass his bedside evaluation, it was
recommended that he go for a video swallow which showed that
he was at risk for aspiration.  Tube feeds were continued at
that time.

The patient progressed throughout the day with increasing
agitation, attempting to discontinue IV lines, arterial
catheter, as well as his nasogastric tube, and a one-to-one
sitter was obtained at that time.  Due to the patient's
tenuous respiratory status, he was kept in the Intensive Care
Unit where aggressive pulmonary toilet was continued.

On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient's mental status had significantly
improved.  On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry floor.  He was noted
to have questionable arrhythmia of either non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia, versus wide complex supraventricular
tachycardia; however, he continued to have multiple episodes
of this.  The patient's epicardial pacing wires were
discontinued on 2010-12-05 00:00:00.

The patient's primary cardiology group was consulted about
the arrhythmia issues.  He was seen here by the
Electrophysiology service and it was decided upon that the
patient would be transferred to UPMCE
under the direction of Dr. Mayton and Dr. Cindy, who would
plan to take him for electrophysiology study at UPMCE and questionable automatic implantable
cardioverter - defibrillator placement as indicated.

On 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the patient was reassessed by the speech
therapist and it was their recommendation at that time that
he was stable, that his swallowing had improved
significantly, that he could continue with supervised
feedings only and it was their recommendation to continue
tube feeds until he was able to take an adequate oral intake.

The patient's most recent laboratory values are from 2010-12-05 00:00:00, which revealed a white blood cell count of 10,900,
hematocrit of 31.7, and a platelet count of 391,000.  Sodium
146, potassium 4.8, (the repeat of his potassium the
following day was 4.7) chloride 106, CO2 34, BUN 31,
creatinine 0.7, blood glucose 109.  PT 12.3, PTT 31.2.

Condition today, 2010-12-05 00:00:00, the day of discharge is as
follows: the patient is without complaints.  The patient's
tube feeds have been on hold; however, he does continue with
the nasogastric tube in place.  Temperature is 97.9 F, pulse
58 and normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 106/96, oxygen
saturation is 98% on four liters nasal cannula.  His 24 hours
intakes and outputs were 860 in, 670 out as of midnight last
night.  The coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.
His sternum is stable without drainage.  His lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally.
