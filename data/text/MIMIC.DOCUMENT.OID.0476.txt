History of Present Illness:
81 yo woman with PMH signficant for SLE, gout, CHF and MVR,
severe osteoporosis who was admitted on 2009-11-04 00:00:00 to 123 Any St.
123 Any St. from NH, c/o bilateral hip pain. She denied trauma but
had an overlying hematoma on the right side, however she does
not "recall anything" at this point. Plain x-rays showed
bilateral hip fractures, intratrochanteric on one side and
femoral neck on other. The patient was initially hypotensive to
the 80s but then responded to fluids. She was admitted to
Medicine due to medical comorbidity. Surgery was initally
planned for 2009-11-04 00:00:00 but on that day, she developed hypoxemia and
cyanosis and CXR showed pulmonary edema, so she was diuresed
with Lasix and Bumex and she did well though her O2 sats
remained in the high 90??????s on 2-3LNC. Cardiology and Pulmonary
were consulted. Pulmonary felt, that she likely has interstitial
underlying lung disease as well that is contributing to her
hypoxemia. Duonebs were given. She was continued on betablockers
for rate control but Coumadin was held. She was not on any other
form of DVT prophylaxis or anticoagulation. She was also found
to have a UTI from ESBL-E.coli and was treated with Zosyn. The
patient was also noted to be thrombocytopenic, chronically
around 65K which was attributed to SLE. Her anemia was ranging
around a Hgb 8.3-8.5. She was transfused 1 Unit PRBC??????s, Hct 27.9
prior to transfer. The patient also has ARF with an unclear
baseline (last 1.0 in 2009-11-04 00:00:00) now Creatinine 1.2 per last report.

.
She was admitted to UPMCE on 2009-11-04 00:00:00.  She was evaluated by
ortho123 Any St.s for operative repair of her hips.  She was assessed
to be fluid overloaded as part of her hypoxia.  Diuresis was
started.  There was concern about a PE, so a CTA was done on
2009-11-04 00:00:00 which showed no PE, but did show bilateral pleural
effusions with patchy ground glass opacities, apical
interlobular septal thickening and peripheral reticulation.
There was mediastinal and hilar adenopathy.
.
The decision was made to diurese further, and her oxygen
requirement was decreased from 3L to 1L nc.  She had a repeat UA
which showed E.coli that was sensitive to bactrim, so the zosyn
was changed to bactrim.
.
On 2009-11-04 00:00:00 she was felt stable to go to the OR the following day
for possible surgical repair of both hips.  On 2009-11-04 00:00:00 she was
taken to the OR and the left hip repair was started.  She was
noted to have a large amount of bleeding, and an intraopeartive
hct was 21% (from 30% the 123 Any St.us day).  She was given 3u PRBC
intraoperatively.  She was noted to have an arrhythmia vs ST
depressions on telemetry during this time.  The decision was
made to not proceed with the right hip at this time.
.
There was a postoperative attempt at extubation, which per
report she failed due to rising CO2.
.
At this time she is intubated, on a propofol gtt.
.
123 Any St. NH, no evidence of trauma.

40%
Ge: Intubated, sedated
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, anicteric
NECK: no LAD, JVD at 8cm, no carotid bruit, left EJ in place
COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, no r/g, split 2, III/VI holosystolic
murmur over apex. No RV heave.
PULM: crackles about 1/3 up both lung fields anteriorlly.  No
wheeze.
ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt
Skin: warm extremities, large hematoma over R knee, back not
examined.
EXT: 1+ DP, 2+ edema, swelling of b/l hip.  Left hip bandaged
with soft tissue swelling of thigh.  RLE shortened and
externally rotated.
GU: Perineal bruising / hematoma with swelling of left labia >
right labia.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO at OSH: Preserved LV function, R pulm HTN, RV enlargement,
TV 51mmHg
.
ECHO here: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2009-11-04 00:00:00,
left ventricular systolic function appears preserved. Tricuspid
regurgitation is now more prominent and pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is now higher.
.
CTA: 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.  Bilateral
pleural effusions with patchy ground-glass opacity, apical
interlobular septal thickening, and peripheral reticulation.
Findings likely,
at least in part, reflect a degree of hydrostatic pulmonary
edema.  It is unclear what component of these changes are
chronic in nature.  If indicated, followup CT after the
patient's acute clinical findings have been treated may be
performed. 3. Numerous thoracic compression fractures, age
indeterminate. 4. Coronary artery and other vascular
calcifications consistent with atherosclerosis.  5.  Mediastinal
and hilar lymphadenopathy.
.
HIP Xray: 1.  Displaced right femur intratrochanteric fracture
with pins in situ. 2.  Left femur fracture.
.
CT HEAD: No acute intracranial pathology including no sign of
intracranial hemorrhage.
.
R Elbow: 2views: Radial head fracture
.
BNP: 2009-11-04 00:00:00 9000 at OSH

Admission EKG: Afib, V-paced, HR 70, ST scooping in I;
throughout three sequential EKG on 2009-11-04 00:00:00/2009-11-04 00:00:00 patient is
developing a TWI in isolated V2

Brief Hospital Course:
# B/l hip fractures 2009-11-04 00:00:00 osteoporosis s/p repair:  The patient
was originally admitted with bilateral hip fractures, the left
newer than the right, of unclear origin as there was no known
trauma or fall. However, there was no suspicion of abuse and
social work confirmed this. After some respiratory optimization,
described below, and reversal of her INR with vitamin K and FFP,
the patient underwent a left hemiarthroplasty on 2009-11-04 00:00:00.
Intraoperatively, some abnormal appearing changes, possible ST
depressions, appeared on her telemetry and the operation limited
to only the left side at that time. She was a difficult ween
from the ventilator and was transferred to the MICU for rule out
ACS and vent ween. She was ruled out by a normal EKG and 3 sets
of negative cardiac biomarkers. She also required several units
of PRBCs for postoperative anemia. She was extubated shortly
thereafter. She returned to the OR for a right ORIF and removal
of the preexisting hardware on 2009-11-04 00:00:00. Again, post operatively
she developed respiratory distress and had to be reintubated and
transferred to the MICU. During her time in the MICU, there was
noted to be soft tissue swelling of her R knee and thigh but an
ultrasound showed no DVT and no gross hematoma.  After
stabilization the patient returned to the floor and began
working with physical therapy. She was WBAT with anterolateral
hip precautions. Her pain was controlled initially with IV
morphine and PO oxycodone but she was eventually transitioned to
Percocet with good effect. She was also begun on calcium and
vitamin D supplementation to augment her Actonel usage. She was
maintained on enoxaparin prophylaxis until her coumadin level
returned to a thera123 Any St. range. She will continue physical
therapy at her rehabilitation center with a follow up with Dr.
Geer in orthopedics.

# Respiratory distress: Upon transfer from the OSH, the patient
had a new oxygen requirement of unknown etiology. After an
initial concern of PE a CTA was done that showed no PE but
chronic interstitial lung disease with possible acute pulmonary
edema overlying it. A repeat echocardiogram showed a preserved
LVEF but moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. She carries
a diagnosis of CHF but discussions with the PCP could not
further clarify its cause or current status. Based on clinical
status, it is likely diastolic dysfunction. Prior to her first
operation, the patient was diuresed with IV Lasix with
improvement in her oxygen requirement. After the operation, she
was not able to intially extubated but was extubated within 24
hours and did well subsequently. She returned to the OR on 2009-11-04 00:00:00
and developed postoperative respiratory distress and hypercarbia
(ABG 7.0/99/84), likely from fluid overload and sedation. She
was reintubated, diuresed with IV lasix and extubated
sucessfully the next day. The patient was weened from her O2 to
room air and placed back on her outpatient regimen of 40mg Lasix
PO BID and Spironolactone 25mg PO daily to maintain her current
fluid balance. She remained stable on room air with minimal
subjective shortness of breath.

# Anemia: Over the course of her admission, the patient has
required a total of 9 units of PRBCs to be transfused for intra
and postoperative blood loss, including a small amount of
bleeding into her bilateral thighs. The last transfusion was on
2009-11-04 00:00:00 and her hematocrit has remained stable since with no
further signs of bleeding.
.
# Afib: Initially her INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
She was maintained on good rate control using her metoprolol.
After com123 Any St.n of her surgeries, her coumadin was restarted.
Her INR will need to be checked 2-3x/week until it is
therapeutic with a goal INR of 2009-11-04 00:00:00. Her digoxin was also
restarted after the com123 Any St.n of her surgeries.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Pt noted to be hyperkalemic post-op, with no
peaked T waves on EKG (in setting of baseline intraventricular
conduction delay).  Hyperkalemia resolved after administration
of calcium, insulin, and D50; this issue has remained stable.
.
# Prosthetic (porcine) valve/MVR: No need for continued
anticoagulation for this reason.  Valve function appears to be
good based on echocardiogram.
.
# ARF: Cr was noted to be 1.2 on admission and 1.7 at the OSH,
with no recent recorded baseline (last Cr 2009-11-04 00:00:00). Currently, this
issue is resolved after blood transfusion with recent Cr of 0.9
- 1.0.  The etiology was likely prerenal with poor forward flow
from CHF.
.
# UTI: E.Coli UTI here, noted on admission. Reported as ESBL at
OSH and initially got Zosyn, however then found to be bactrim
sensitive, which was treated with 7 day course of Bactrim which
finished 2009-11-04 00:00:00. No further signs of infection.
.
# Depression: Patient continued on home regimen of citalopram
20mg PO daily.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued on home regimen of
levothyroxine 88mcg daily.
.
# FEN:  Regular as tolerated.  Patient not hungry, so have added
Ensure TID to supplement
.
# Prophylaxis: Enoxaparin 40mg SC daily, pneumoboots, PPI PO
(home regimen), bowel regimen.
.
# Access: PICC

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
123 Any St. - [**Location (un) **]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Bilateral Hip Fractures s/p L hemiarthroplasty (2009-11-04 00:00:00) and R
ORIF (2009-11-04 00:00:00)
Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure
Lupus with interstitial lung disease.


Discharge Condition:
All vitals signs stable, off oxygen. Hematocrit stable. Pain
well controlled.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with fractures of both hips. You also had some
trouble breathing, requiring oxygen. This was likely from fluid
build up in your lungs, backing up from your heart. This is
called congestive heart failure. This fluid was removed using IV
Lasix and then will be kept off using the oral form of Lasix you
were 123 Any St.usly on. Your hip fractures were repaired surgically,
however after each surgery, you had increased trouble breathing,
requiring intubation and stays in the medical ICU. However, you
quickly recovered after more fluid was taken off with Lasix.

You also had a drop in your blood count after the operations,
from blood loss during the operation and some bleeding into the
legs after the operation. You received a number of blood
transfusions to correct this. However, your blood count is now
stable and you have no further signs of bleeding.

You also had a small and temporary decrease in your kidney
function upon admission, likely due to some dehydration. This
improved and was normal by the time of discharge.

You also had a urinary tract infection treated with a course of
antibiotics, finished in the hospital.

During your first operation, there was a concern about your
heart based on the EKG taken during the operation. However,
subsequent labs tests showed no damage to the heart and no heart
attack.

You were also given some pain medications to control your pain.
These will continue at the rehab facility. You will also
continue
