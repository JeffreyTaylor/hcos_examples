right lower lobe pneumonia on 2008-11-25 00:00:00 and completed a 10 day
course of levofloxacin. However, he was brought to ED by group
home staff on 2008-11-25 00:00:00 with fevers to 101 and productive cough -
unclear if white or yellow phlegm. The patient was febrile in
the ED with a WBC of 18.8 and placed on Levo/Flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia with CXR showing persistent cavitary RLL
pneumonia with effusion. He was found to have a lung abscess and
treated with IV Levo/Clinda.

Past Medical History:

seizures

Social History:

Lives in group home

Family History:
noncontributory


Physical Exam:
Tc=96.1  P=114  BP=130/78  RR=23 100% O2 I/O = 2075/1630

Gen - aphasic, very thin male, may at times respond to command,
alert
HEENT - PERLA, EOMI
Heart - increased rate, RRR, no M/R/G, clear S1, S2
Lungs - decreased BS at right base with crackles in mid-right
lung and bibasilar
Abd - NT, ND + BS
Ext - no cyanosis/positive clubbing/no edema, moves all four
extremities spontaneously


Pertinent Results:
CXR 2008-11-25 00:00:00 AP: Peristent right lung opacification - pleural
effusion with rounded lucency suggesting cavitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
36 yo M w/cerebral palsy, epilepsy, history of recurrent
aspiration pneumonias, aphasia now with right lower lobe lung
asbcess.

CT Chest 2008-11-25 00:00:00: Necrotizing pneumonia in RML and RLL, lung
abscess. Cannot tell if effusions given limited study secondary
to scoliosis. Of note, bright contrast in gallbladder - sludge
vs. stone vs. contrast reaction vs. prior study residual

1. RLL pneumonia - CT notable for lung abscess. Pulmonology was
consulted and recommended Levofloxacin/Clindamycin. The patient
will need a course of 4 weeks of Levofloxacin/Clindamycin and
then clinda for as long as needed. Last day of levofloxacin is
2008-11-25 00:00:00. Once the four week course is concluded, a repeat
chest xray should be taken to evaluate for resolution of the
lung abscess. If the abscess persists or the patient's
fevers/cough persist, clindamycin should be continued until
these resolve. An active issue in-house was the patient's
ability to take oral antibiotics as he intermittently spit the
antibiotics out.  Therefore, a PICC was placed on 2008-11-25 00:00:00 for IV
antibiotics. Near the date of discharge, the patient was
tolerating his oral antibiotics. However, if he does not take
these antibiotics, he should be administered the IV form through
the PICC in his right arm. The PICC may then be removed after
antibiotics use has been completed.

2. Fevers -  Patient's temp down to 100s with antibiotics. He
remained afebrile while on antibiotics.

3. Epilepsy - The patient's dilantin dose was adjusted secondary
to a subtherapeutic level. He was maintained on Dilantin 100 mg
PO Q8 hours. Plan to continue dilantin at current dose and check
dilantin level on Monday, 2008-11-25 00:00:00 and adjust dilantin level
as needed.

4. Recurrent aspirations - The patient's family was concerned
that the patient had lost at lost a great deal of weight at the
group home where he staying. He had tolerated ground feeds while
at home with his mother one year ago. As a result, a video
speech and swallow evaluation was performed and showed that the
patient was aspirating all consistencies of food and had a
suppressed cough reflex most of the time. While eating on the
floor with aspiration precautions, the patient aspirated and
became hypoxic to 40% and went up to 90% with aggressive
suctioning. He was therefore transferred to the UPMCE for
aggressive respiratory management where he was maintained on a
shovel face mask of 9 L O2, kept NPO and continued on IV
antibiotics. Intubation was not required and he was subsequently
transferred to the floor.

Neurology was consulted to evaluate the patient (known to Dr.
Bourque to evaluate if the patient's dysphagia was related to
his known cerebral palsy or represented a new neurologic event.
The family was also concerned because they stated that the
patient was able to walk with assistance one year ago. A CT of
the head showed no acute change that would explain the patient's
decline and inabilities to swallow or walk. Neurology
recommended the patient follow up with Dr. Bourque. In terms of
the patient's dysphagia, the family indicated that they felt the
patient most enjoyed eating and in order to maintain his quality
of life, we should continue to feed him ground food knowing that
he will ultimately aspirate. Thus, the patient was continued on
a ground diet with thickened liquids which he tolerated.

5. Tachycardia - Of note patient with noted resting tachycardia
in 110-120 level. It is believed this is related to dehydration
as the patient responded to IV fluids.

6. Depression - The patient was noticed to be withdrawn during
most of his hospital course. However, he interacts more when his
family is present. As a result, Remeron 7.5 mg was started to
treat his depression.
