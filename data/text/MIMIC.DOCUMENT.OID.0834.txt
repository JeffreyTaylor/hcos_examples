Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:Khasim Diroff
Chief Complaint:
Seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and ventilation at UPMCE Hospital
Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
cc: Seizures versus syncope transferred from UPMCE at around
3 am, UPMCE was at maximal capacity therefore could not accept the
transfer.

72 yo man with an extensive past medical history, and of note:
End Stage Renal Disease(started on hemodialysis one month ago),
dialysis days Tue/Khasim Diroff/Sat
Normal pressure hydrocephalus & Parkinsonism (s/p VP UPMCE
Hakim programmable shunt placed at the UPMCE in Han 2005-06-06 00:00:00, on
2005-06-06 00:00:00 setting changed from 9-->11 cm of water).

He has had no 123 Any St.us seizures and he presented with 2 episodes
that were thought to be seizures (note in 2005-06-06 00:00:00 at UPMCE prior to
his L CEA he had 2XEEGs), intubated at OSH. Wife reports that
his mental status has waxed and waned for the past years,
however, she noticed that he has been more confused for the past
1 week than usual. For over a week he has felt light headed. He
was feeling dizzy all day long yesterday. She reports a mild
fall backwards on the toilet without hitting his head or any
loss of consciouness. Of note, he had been having more frequent
headaches recently and he had his shunt re-adjusted 5 days ago.
At 6:30pm his wife found him on the floor, unresponsive, with
blood coming out of his mouth as he had bit his tongue. She
called 911 and he was taken to UPMCE Hospital. He had an
event where he arched his head, eyes rolled back and there was
extensor posturing of his arms and legs, and this lasted
minutes. He received morphine 2 mg, dilaudid 0.5 mg, ativan 2
mg, Etomidate 20, Succ 150 and he was intubated for airway
protection and so it is unclear which Khasim Diroff aborted the event.
He was then transferred here. Neurosurgery were consulted on the
patient, and as per Neurosurgery mentioned that if the shunt
required tapping they would do it, but left no recs. He received
ceftriaxone 2g, vancomycin 1g and acyclovir 700mg empirically in
ER. He also received 500mg dilantin in ER.

On contacting Dr Zayed Zayed, he mentioned that he had seen the
patient last Friday and was concerned about syncopal events for
over a week. Post HD his SBP had been dropping and he was on a
number on anti-HTN agents. During his in patient stay at UPMCE,
it became clear that these episodes were syncopal related to his
severe orthostatic hypotension.


Past Medical History:
-renal failure (started on HD one month ago),
-NPH (s/p VP shunt placed at B&W on 2005-06-06 00:00:00/09),
-HTN,
-Left iliac and femoral disease secondary to hypertension.
-Left lower extremity bypass.
-Bilateral hip replacement
-Left endarterectomy
-Orthiostatic Hypotension
-CHF
-?Parkinson's disease


Social History:
Ex-smoker, at least 30 pack years. In the past, heavy alcohol
intake, past few years one cocktail per night, stopped alcohol
when he had ESRD and was on HD. Retired RH businessman, owned a
hardware store. No IV drug abuse.


Family History:
Mother had Ishayu Zayed disease.
Son had ESRD-->probably secondary to Lithium (died of
thrombocytopenia&massive hemorrhage, he had schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder)

Pertinent Results:
2005-06-06 00:00:00 EEG
IMPRESSION: This portable EEG shows fairly regular alpha
frequencies
throughout, in anterior and posterior areas. This is most
suggestive of
widespread medication effect, likely obscuring other background
features. There were no areas of focal (or generalized) slowing,
and
there were no epileptiform features.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of 2005-06-06 00:00:00  3:29:46 AM
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial abnormality
Prominent precordial lead QRS voltage suggests left ventricular
hypertrophy
Prolonged Q-Tc interval
Modest ST-T wave changes

CXR 2005-06-06 00:00:00
Findings: The endotracheal tube distal tip projects 2.9 cm above
the carina. The distal tip of NG tube is not well visualized.
The VP shunt is noted. The left central line distal tip projects
in the cavoatrial junction. The mediastinal and hilar contours
are prominent, most likely due to vascular congestion. However
attention to the mediastineal contour inthe follow up imaging is
recommended. The right lung is clear. Small left pleural
effusion and left basilar atelectasis is noted.

CThead 2005-06-06 00:00:00
IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage.

2. Status post placement of the VP shunt. Mild prominence of the
lateral
ventricles with no transependymal migration of CSF.

2005-06-06 00:00:00
CT L-spine
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute vertebral compression fracture or
paravertebral
hematoma.
2. Transitional anatomy at the lumbosacral junction, as
described.
3. Multilevel lumbar spondylosis with multifactorial moderately
severe spinal  canal stenosis, from the L2-L3 through L4-5
levels, as detailed above.
4. Extensive atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and its
branches.

Rib series X-Ray, hip X-ray, R gleno-humeral X-rays showed no
new fractures or dislocations

Brief Hospital Course:
2005-06-06 00:00:00 He was transferred to the TICU, and was successfully weaned
off the ventilator.
2005-06-06 00:00:00 He had visual hallucinations (people with guns) on
Rivastigmine, therefore it was discontinued.
2005-06-06 00:00:00 He continued to be orthostatic, Sinemet stopped, and most
of his anti-hypertensive medication doses were either stopped or
reduced.
2005-06-06 00:00:00 He was started on Aricept 5 mg in the mornings with
breakfast and Clonazepam 0.25 mg at night (for REM sleep
disturbances - nightmares).

During his admission, he had hemodialysis on Tuesday/Thursday
and Saturday. He was reviewed by Dermatology, who suggested
topical treatment for his psoriasis, and this has been explained
in his discharge planning. He was reviewed by the Autonomics
team who advised follow-up in the outpatient setting for
autonomic testing, and they also recommended Midodrine 2.5 mg
prn on hemodialysis days, if the patient was walking (not when
he was lying down). He could not have an MRI because the
neurosurgical team at UPMCE did not have the device required to
reprogram his shunt if needed after the MRI.

3. Psoriasis with terafirma on the shins


Discharge Condition:
He was still orthostatic on walking. However, he did not have
any visual hallucinations for over 48 h.


Discharge Instructions:
You have had syncopal episodes because your blood pressure is
too low when you stand up.

You have also been diagnosed with Zayed Body Disease, which is
why you have visual hallucinations and features of Parkinsonism.
Medications aggravating your condition have been stopped.

Followup Instructions:
Neurology: 2005-06-06 00:00:00 - Dr Zayed Zayed at 8:30 am, UPMCE Building
123 Any St., Rm 253
