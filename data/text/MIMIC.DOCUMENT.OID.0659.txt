PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is alert, oriented, in no acute
distress. HEENT examination: No jugular venous distension.
Carotids are palpable bilaterally 1+ with bruits bilaterally.
Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart is regular rate and
rhythm without murmur, gallop or rub. Abdominal examination
is soft, nontender. There are no bruits or masses. No aortic
prominence. Peripheral vascular examination shows the right
first and fifth toe with dry gangrenous changes. The right
heel area with a superficial ulceration. The feet are pale
bilaterally but warm. The right toes is with ruborous

right Dopplerable. On the left 2+ palpable. Popliteals are
Dopplerable bilaterally. The right dorsalis pedis is absent.
The right posterior tibialis is a Dopplerable signal only.
The left DP and PT are Dopplerable. Neurological exam: He is
oriented x3, nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. He was prepared for a right carotid endarterectomy.
He underwent this on 2007-08-30 00:00:00. He tolerated the
procedure well. He was transferred to the post anesthesia
care unit neurologically intact and stable. He required Neo-
Synephrine drip for low urinary output. Patient's
postoperative hematocrit was 31.7, BUN 16, creatinine 0.9.
Patient continued to do well. Postoperative day 1 his Neo-
Synephrine was weaned. His diet was advanced as tolerated. He
did have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia but they
were nonsustained and his Neo-Synephrine dose was decreased.
He was restarted on his home medications and the Neo was
weaned. Patient remained in the VICU. He was preopped for
potential right leg revascularization with a femoral-femoral
bypass but developed florid flash pulmonary edema and
required admission to the SICU. He was intubated for
respiratory insufficiency and his oxygenation improved. He
continued on his Neo and Unasyn for his foot. He was
transfused for his hematocrit of 28.5. He remained in the
SICU. He was followed by his cardiologist, Dr. Ruhlman. Patient
was aggressively diuresed and metoprolol was used for his
supraventricular tachycardia. Patient was extubated on
postoperative day 3. He continued to do well and he was
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
His hematocrit remained stable post transfusion. His
creatinine was remained stable with diuresis. His diet was
advanced from clears to as tolerated on postoperative day 4.
Ambulation was begun on postoperative day 4. Neck staples
were discontinued on postoperative day 5. Patient continued
to do well. Patient had an episode of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia. He was asymptomatic. He was sleeping
in a chair. Postoperative day 6 his blood pressure was 70/50
after being placed back in bed but 15 minutes later his blood
pressure was 122/50. His O2 saturation was 96% on 2 liters by
nasal cannula. An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed
no acute changes. He was continued to be monitored. Enzymes
were sent. Those were unremarkable. Electrolytes were checked
and those were stable and did not require any re123 Any St.n.
Because of this episode cardiology was requested to see the
patient to determine whether he would be okay to undergo a
major surgical procedure given his cardiac status. An
echocardiogram was obtained. This demonstrated left atrial
enlargement. The left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was moderately
depressed with inferior and lateral akinesis with anterior
and septal hypokinesis. The aortic valve was mildly thickened
with three leaflets. The mitral valve was mildly thickened.
There was mild mitral regurgitation. Compared to a 123 Any St.us
study done in 2007-08-30 00:00:00 of this year the left ventricular function
had decreased. The patient underwent a stress test in which
he had no anginal symptoms or electrocardiographic changes
from baseline. A nuclear study demonstrated left ventricular
cavity size was mildly enlarged. The resting and stress
perfusion images revealed severe fixed inferior and lateral
wall defect. There was also a moderate reversible apical
defect with a calculated ejection fraction of 25%. These
findings were reviewed with his cardiologist. After a long
discussion the cardiologist, Dr. Ruhlman and the patient
determined that he was at very high risk for a perioperative
event. The patient elected to proceed to have surgery on his
right leg for his ischemic right rest pain, even with
significant increased risk.

Patient underwent on 2007-08-30 00:00:00 a right common femoral
artery endarterectomy with saphenous vein angioplasty,
angiogram of the aorta and right iliac arteries. Patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the post
anesthesia care unit stable with Dopplerable DP and PT on the
right and the foot was pink with 2 to 3 second capillary
refill. Postoperatively the patient remained hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. Postoperative day #1 there were no
overnight events. The patient's diet was advanced as
tolerated. His fluids were hep-locked. He was gently diuresed
with Lasix and ambulation to a chair was begun. Cardiology
continued to follow the patient. He continued on his beta
blockers. Spirolactone was added daily for blood pressure and
diuresis. Patient's Foley was discontinued on 2007-08-30 00:00:00. He was continued on Augmentin perioperatively. Patient
continued to progress. He was continued on all his
preadmission medications. He was to be evaluated by physical
therapy on postoperative day 4 of his right leg bypass to
determine whether or not he would be safe to be discharged to
home. Pending this evaluation patient will be discharged when
medically stable either to rehabilitation or to home.
