History of Present Illness:
Asked to eval this 86 year old white RHM who appears younger
than his stated age for newly diagnosed brain mass. He takes
daily ASA and coumadin for AFIB.  Pt and wife give history.
They report that he has had frequent falls recently, the latest
being yesterday.  He did strike his head yeadsterday but did not
have LOC or sz.  He has baseline incontinence from prostate CA
and straight caths 6 xs day for this.  He feels that he has been
falling due to weakness on his right side.  Due to the falls he
has had exacerbation of his back pain.  He stopped his coumadin
one week ago for planned EDSI at UPMCE.  After his
EDSI he walked himself over to a neurology clinic requesting to
be seen - he had imaging and was sent here for neurosurgical
evaluation.  Admits to pain at back of head, Denies dizziness,
N/V, sz, CP or SOB.

Studies:
Brain MRI w/w/o contrast 2005-04-18 00:00:00 -
A large mass measuring 3.2-cm in greatest dimension is present
within the
left posterior parasagittal parietal lobe. The mass is complex
in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular
enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral
slow diffusion. Tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis,
although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous T2
hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates T2
isointensity. A complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although
the CT obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this
mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible
that the density may be diminished. Possibly, both may be the
case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. Abscess is considered
less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on
diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion.

2. Multifocal confluent and FLAIR hyperintensities are present
within the
periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted
diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the
sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

C/A/P CT 2005-04-18 00:00:00 -
1. Left upper lobe soft tissue mass with coarse calcification,
associated
traction bronchiectasis, and calcified hilar nodes. Additionally
pleural
calcification can be seen in prior asbestos exposure. There is
underlying
emphysema. These findings are worrisome for malignancy, though
prior
granulomatous infection might also have this appearance.
Correlation with
further studies (e.g. PET-CT, and/or biopsy) is recommended.

2. There is no evidence of malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis.

Head Ct 2005-04-18 00:00:00 -
1. Status post resection of a left parietal mass with expected
post-surgical sequelae including pneumocephalus as well as some
blood products within the surgical bed.
2. Layering pneumocephalus along the left frontal cerebral
hemisphere with adjacent mass effect.
3. Ventricles appear more prominent on today's study compared to
MRI of 2005-04-18 00:00:00, concerning for early ventriculomegaly.
Recommend followup CT to monitor.
4. Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensities, more prominent on the left versus the right are
relatively unchanged since MRI

Brain MRI 2005-04-18 00:00:00 -
1. Status post resection of left parietooccipital mass with
blood products at the surgical site without definite residual
enhancement. Pneumocephalus is seen and expected post-surgical
changes seen at the surgical site.

2. Linear area of restricted diffusion, extending deeper from
the surgical site to the left periatrial region could represent
an area of ischemia adjacent to the surgical site. Clinical
correlation recommended.

3. Changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy. No other
enhancing
brain lesions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to Neurosurgery for workup of new Left parietal lesion.
 Coumadin and aspirin were held on admission.  MRI with and
without Gadolinium revealed only the one solitary left parietal
lesion and therefore the decision was made to resect the lesion.
 Steroids were held for the possiblity of lymphoma.  Concern for
metastatic prostate CA to the brain was low, however CT
chest/Abd/Pelvis was performed for oncological workup.
Chest/Abd/Pelv CT obtained on 2005-04-18 00:00:00 demonstrated a LUL mass
with calcifications and b/l hilar adenopathy.  On 2005-04-18 00:00:00,
patient underwent left-sided craniotomy and ressection of the
left parietal mass. He was extubated without incident and
transferred to SICU for management.  His ICU course was
uneventful.  His post-operative CT and MRI showed post operative
changes without evidence of new acute hemorrhage.  He was
trasnferred to the floor in stable condition.

During his course on the floor, patient had persistent
hypertension. He was started on amlodipine 5mg with minimal
response. Medicine was consulted for Hypertension management.
Additionally, Thoracic surgery and neuro oncology were consulted
regarding the LUL mass and brain mass, respectively.  He was
transfered to the medicine service for further evaluation and
management.  The remainder of his course was as follows:

# Left parietal mass/left upper lung mass/likely new cancer
diagnosis: Patient and wife aware that mass likely represents a
cancer, most likely metastatic lung cancer, though not certain
as pathology is pending at time of discharge.  Dexamethasone was
tapered off.  Keppra was started for seizure prophylaxis and
should be stopped 10 days following discharge.  Pathology of the
mass will be followed-up as an outpatient.  Patient should
follow-up with Dr. Drewry Eichwald
in thoracics, and medical oncology in the thoracic oncology
clinic.  He will also need a PET/CT scan as an outpatient for
further evaluation and staging of his disease.  Please see
discharge paperwork regarding the appointments that need to be
scheduled when he arrives at rehab.  Additionally, he will
require PCP Dauntay Ulrey on discharge from rehab.

# Hypertension: BP was elevated post-op (160 and higher) and
improved on amlodipine and tapering of the dexamethasone.  He
was also continued on his home regimen of metoprolol, prazosin,
and nitroglycerine patch.  BP was 110-130 on day of discharge.
If blood pressure drops further, decrease amlodipine to 2.5 mg
daily.

# Urinary incontinence/retension and E. coli urinary tract
infection: Patient has a history of urinary retension and
incontince and straight caths himself multiple times per day
(~2005-04-18 00:00:00).  His urine culture grew >100K E. coli, pan-sensitive.
He also had an elevated WBC count.  He was started on
ceftriaxone on 2005-04-18 00:00:00 and is being discharged on cefpodoxime.  He
should have a total 14 day course for complicated UTI and will
need 12 additional days on discharge.  Foley catheter was
removed and regular straight cathing Q3-4 hours per home regimen
was reinstated to reduce risk of reinfection and promote
ambulation.

# Atrial fibrillation: Stable.  Patient remained rate controlled
on home regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol.  Warfarin was
stopped due to craniotomy and can be restarted on 2005-04-18 00:00:00.  He
should have his INR checked on 2005-04-18 00:00:00 and every other day until his
warfarin dose and INR are stabilized.  Goal INR is 2.0-3.0.

# Coronary artery disease: Stable.  Metoprolol and statin
continued.  Aspirin was held.  It should be restarted on
2005-04-18 00:00:00.

# Obstructive sleep apnea - Patient was continued on CPAP per
home regimen.

# Prostate cancer - Patient was continued on bicalutamide.  He
also receives goserelin injections from his urologist.

# Glaucoma - Continued timolol and lantanoprost eye drops

# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen while on pain
medications that should be weaned off.
# Code: Full
# Communication: Patient, HCP Dauntay Ulrey Dauntay Ulrey (wife)

On day of discharge, patient is afebrile and vital signs are
stable.  He is tolerating an oral diet and ambulating with
assistance.  His wound is clean, dry and intact.  He has no
focal neurological deficits.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital following a fall and found to
have a mass in your brain.  Dr. Drewry Eichwald, your neurosurgeon,
removed this mass and the pathology to determine exactly what it
is, is still pending, though it is most likely some form of
cancer.  You were also found to have a mass in the left upper
lobe of your lung.  We have scheduled some specialist follow-up
appointments for you and additional appointments still need to
be scheduled.  These appointments are important to make sure
that you receive prompt evaluation and treatment for your
condition.  Please be sure to make and go to all appointments.

The following changes were made to your medications:
START Keppra 500 mg twice a day (for seizure prophylaxis).  You
should stop this medication 10 days after you leave the
hospital.
START Cefpodoxime 200 mg every 12 hours (for urinary tract
infection) for 12 more days.
START Amlodipine 5 mg daily for blood pressure.  If your blood
pressure drops below 115 systolic, this medication can be
stopped.
START oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.  While
you take this medication, STOP ultram.  As your pain gets
better, you can stop the oxycodone and go back to ultram.
START colace, senna, and miralax as needed to prevent
constipation
STOP Skelaxin.  You seemed to do okay without this medication.
START heparin for clot prophylaxis until your INR is therapeutic
or you are moving enough at rehab to prevent clots.
You can RESTART your aspirin and warfarin on 2005-04-18 00:00:00.  Please
get your INR checked on the 4th day thereafter and at least
every other day until your INR and warfarin dose are stable.
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0.

Additional instructions from your neurosurgeons are below:
General Instructions
