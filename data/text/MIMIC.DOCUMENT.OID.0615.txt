Patient is 72 year Spanish speaking male with PMHx of
Parkinson's Disease who presents to the ED for complaints of
shortness of breath. Per patient daughter he was at his baseline
health until night prior to admission when patient described
shortness of breath and sensation that his airways were blocked.
Patient was seen at UPMCE a few weeks ago for similar symptoms.
Per daughter etiology of shortness of breath was not identified
and thought breathing difficulty could be due to anxiety.

not seem to coorelate with any medications. He has noticed no
change in his speech or any trouble with swallowing or eating
and drinking foods.
During this episode of shortness of breath at home patient

present,
he had brief unresponsiveness and was found to be in atrial
fibrillation. A nasal trumpet was placed with return of
responsiveness and of sinus rhythm. He was brought to UPMCE. On
arrival to ICU patient comfortable denies any shortness of
breath. He has a nasal trumpet in place. His O2Sat remains above
90% on room air but appears to drop when patient falls asleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Ottman is a 72 y/o male with h/o Parkinson's disease who
presents from home with shortness of breath, now resolved.
.
## Shortness of Breath: The patient was admitted and had one
recurrent episode on his first night of admission which
unimproved by Parkinson's meds. We hypothesized that his
underlying Parkinson's disease may be contributing to these
episodes. The episode was relieved by a small dose of Ativan;
there appeared to be a large component of anxiety to the
episodes, but that is unlikely to be the sole cause, as he does
have objectively unusual breathing. He was evaluated by
Neurology during his admission who recommended continuing his
medical regimen for Parkinson's.
- The patient will follow up in Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Juanetta Nuesca
Ottman. PFTs are planned as an outpatient.
- The patient reportedly had an episode of atrial fibrillation
per EMS; however, this did no recur while hospitalized.
- The patient was discharged with clonazepam to use as needed
during these episodes as this seemed to give relief.
- He will have an outpatient sleep study as well to evaluate for
sleep apnea.
.
## Parkinson's Diease. The patient was continued on his usual
medication regimen.
.
## Cardiac. Patient with reported atrial fibrillation per EMS
but none seen while in-house. It is doubtful that this was true
a fib; it is more likely he had MAT secondary to respiratory
distress.
- PCP could consider outpatient holter monitor if deemed
necessary.
.
## PPx: The patient was given a bowel regimen, tylenol as
needed, an H2 blocker, and heparin SC.
.
## FEN: He tolerated a regular diet.
.
## Comm: Daughter: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1439**] Christyanna Ottman test@mail.com
.
## Dispo: As the patient was stable hemodynamically without
further evidence of respiratory distress, he was discharged to
home from the MICU.
