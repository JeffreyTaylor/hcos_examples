Allergies:
Percocet / Cefazolin / Vicodin / Oxycodone

Attending:Cebastian Stusse
Chief Complaint:
Metabolic acidosis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47y/o F with a PMH of DM, EtOH abuse, C.
parapsilosis R knee septic arthritis/osteomyelitis recently
admitted with Delirium tremens/PRES now presenting with
hypotension, hypoxia and acute renal failure in the setting of
recent C. diff colitis.
.
The patient was admitted on 2008-08-26 00:00:00 - 2008-08-26 00:00:00 with C parapsilosis
septic knee joint and underwent debridement and drainage and
discharged home on fluconazole.
.
She was then readmitted 2008-08-26 00:00:00 - 2008-08-26 00:00:00 with AMS in the setting
of EtOH withdrawal. Because of very high BPs in MICU (probably
due to severe DTs) and MRI findings, the diagnosis of Posterior
Reversible Leukoencephalopathy (PRES) was made. Infectious w/u
of CNS was negative with negative CSF and blood cx. Upon
aggressive BP reduction and control of EtOH withdrawal the
patient's mental status significantly improved.
.
The patient was discharged home from rehab on 2008-08-26 00:00:00. Pt reports
she began drinking again daily after returning home from rehab.
She was seen in Orthopedics clinic on 2008-08-26 00:00:00 and found to have a
BP of 90/58 and pulse of 40. Her metoprolol was decreased to
50mg Q 12 from Q 6 dosing.
.
She presented to OSH on 2008-08-26 00:00:00 with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
X 1 day after finishing a course of vancomycin for C. diff
colitis. Reports diarrhea started on day of presentation with
2008-08-26 00:00:00 BM over 24 hrs. Reported emesis and inability to take po.
She was admitted to the ICU. Vancomycin was restarted and IV
flagyl started. She was found to be hypotensive with SBP 85/49
and WBC of 17.9. ABG 7.18/18/126 on RA. K 2.8. AG23. Cr 3.4. She
received IV and po bicarb. HCT decreased to 24 and she was given
2U PRBC. BP improved with volume resuscitation, did not require
pressors. She was evaluated by Nephrology and felt to have ATN.
GI performed an EGD demonstrating gastritis. She developed
respiratory distress the evening prior to transfer with ABG
7.17/30/74 on 4L. She was started on BiPAP then transitioned to
6L NC prior to transfer.
.
She in now admitted to the ICU for further management. On
arrival to the ICU, the patient is in no acute distress. Denies
any complaints. Sating well on 2008-08-26 00:00:00 L.

Knee Oblique/AP/lat
Slightly decreased soft tissues in the right suprapatellar
region but no
significant changes in the alternating sclerotic and lucent
regions of distal femur, patella, and proximal tibia. Stable
soft tissue density posterior to the right femur.

2008-08-26 00:00:00
CXR
Increased opacity is seen in the left lung field mid and upper
regions.
Otherwise stable appearance to the right PICC line and other
bilateral
infiltrates noted. No blunting of the CP angles. I do not see
any definite
cavitation at this time.
.
2008-08-26 00:00:00
Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Focal thickening at the tip of
the right coronary cusp might have increased slightly. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small
vegetation on the mitral valve (0.3cmx0.3cm) (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) at the
coaptation point. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of 2008-08-26 00:00:00, the
mild mitral regurgitation is new with a small vegetation seen on
the anterior leaflet at the coaptation point

2008-08-26 00:00:00 MRI knee w/ and w/o contrast:
Again seen is a moderately large knee joint effusion with
enhancement of the residual synovium and/or joint capsule.
Numerous subcentimeter susceptibility artifacts anterior to the
extensor mechanism and in the anterior joint space are unchanged
and likely related to 123 Any St.us surgery. Note is made of fluid
extending outside the joint capsule, extending into the
subcutaneous fat, along the lateral and posterolateral aspect of
the knee (ser 6, im 18), unchanged from the prior study.

Cortical erosion of the articulating surfaces of the tibia as
well as
enhancement of the tibial plateau is unchanged and likely due to
a combination of osteomyelitis, bone infarct, and secondary
osteoarthritis. Bone marrow edema, enhancement, and erosion
along the posterior aspect of the patella is unchanged and are
likely related to osteomyelitis, infarct, osteoarthritis, and an
abutting bone fragment. Bone marrow signal alteration and linear
areas of enhancement in the femoral condyles is unchanged and
may be related to osteomyelitis and/or bone infarcts. Again seen
is cortical irregularity and some areas of cortical disruption
along the femoral condyles.

No definite intraosseous or subcutaneous abscesses.

IMPRESSION:

1) The overall appearance is unchanged compared with 2008-08-26 00:00:00. No
change in
bone marrow signal abnormalities in the femoral condyles, tibial
plateau,
proximal tibial metaphysis, and posterior patella, which likely
reflects some combination of osteomyelitisand/or residual edema
from treated osteomyelitis, bone infarcts, and secondary
osteoarthritis. No new areas of enhancement or bone marrow
edema.

2) Moderately large joint effusion, unchanged since 2008-08-26 00:00:00.
.
2008-08-26 00:00:00 Renal ultrasound:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.6 cm. The left kidney
measures 12.3
cm. No mass, stone or hydronephrosis is demonstrated within the
kidneys.
There is a trace right pleural effusion. The bladder is
moderately distended without focal mass lesion detected within.

IMPRESSION:

1. No hydronephrosis.

2. Trace right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admited to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.

Right knee C.Parapsilosis septic arthritis/osteomyelitis -
started diflucan on 2008-08-26 00:00:00 but noncompliant. Knee exam appears
stable, MRI generally unchanged; 2008-08-26 00:00:00 did not feel it
clinically warranted tapping. As renal function increased over
MICU stay, ID advised increasing diflucan dose. Now on 2008-08-26 00:00:00
months of PO fluconazole. To follow-up with 2008-08-26 00:00:00 and ID as
outpatient.
.
Possibe endocarditis:  Echo showed small new vegatation on
anterior leaflet of mitral valve.  Not present on TEE from early
2008-08-26 00:00:00. Discussed with cardiology and reviewed imaging together;
follow-up in approximately 3 weeks with TTE to see if change in
imaging (appointment as outpatient). No TEE necessary at this
point in time. Patient has never been bacteremic or fungemic. No
new murmur auscultated, no Cebastian Stusse spots or other findings
suggestive of embolic disease seen by optho consult.
.
Acute renal failure with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and
metabolic acidosis: Hx NSAID abuse. Gap and non-gap acidosis on
admission, initially thought to be secondary to diarrhea,
however low bicarbonate persisted beyond diarrhea cessation with
associated hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hypernatremia. This
raised the question of RTA, but that is/was problemAbdalrahman Gill to
invoke in setting of ARF. Renal consulted. Pt treated with
bicarb and then bicarb normalized. She continued to have some
hyperchloremia, likely due to IVF which had 123 Any St.usly been
given. Hypokalemia corrected with re123 Any St.n ?????? may also be 2008-08-26 00:00:00
prolonged diflucan course or alcohol abuse. Renal advised
starting potassium citrate ?????? not on formulary, switched to
Bicitra; then d/c'd bicitra as renal function and acid/base
status improved. Renal advised PO potassium and magnesium daily,
and regular checks of electrolytes (chem 10) and renal function.
.
Possible UTI ?????? urine culture showed 10-100,000 klebsiella
species.  Started Ciprofloxacin, 7 day course (last day 2008-08-26 00:00:00).
.
Clostridium dificile colitis:  Pt started on treatment course
for C. difficile from OSH. Unclear how compliant pt has been
with treatment course, and c.diff +ve at OSH so decided to
restart a treatment course here. Initially on vanc/flagyl.
C.diff culture negative x2 here in hospital. No diarrhea since
admission. Now just PO vancomycin (last day 2008-08-26 00:00:00).
.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure: possibly combination of dCHF,
aspiration, reactive airway disease. CXR shows findings
consistent with volume overload; expiratory wheezes 2008-08-26 00:00:00 COPD vs
cardiogenic. Had 02 requirement, successfully weaned with
initial autodiuresis then minimal lasix. Pt irritated by
albuterol nebs, used atrovent nebs with good effect. Aspiration
precautions. Patient weaned down to room air, SpO2 100% at
discharge and without SOB.
.
Hypertension: had been hypotensive in setting of prolonged
diarrhea, dCHF, decreased PO intake. Held antihypertensives, but
then pressures were persistently elevated. So treated with
metoprolol, clonidine, amlodipine, with dose adjustment as
needed. Lisinopril continued to be held due to ARF, during
hospitalization. If continues to be hypertensive, suggest that
next med to be added/changed would be the addition of an ACE
inhibitor, ie; lisinopril (was on 40mg daily, would start at
10mg daily and titrate up, as tolerated by creatinine). Plan to
titrate down the clonidine, over 3 days, by halving dose each
day (continuing tid though).
.
Alcohol Abuse with hx DTs/PRES:
Diazepam per CIWA protocol. Got Zyprexa in ICU to provide some
sedation with decreased benzo load and clonidine. SW consulted.
No s/s of withdrawal while on floor. Discussed alcohol cessation
with patient.
.
Diabetes mellitus, type II, poorly controlled: continued lantus
and insulin SS, with adjustments to treat hyperglycemia
throughout hospital course. continue on sliding scale, and
adjust as needed to treat blood sugars.
.
Hypernatremia: corrected with free water drinking and D5W via
IV. Etiology unclear; perhaps hyperaldosterone state - please
follow-up renin and aldosterone level tests, sent from UPMCE on
the patient - or renal tubular acidosis are questionable.
Encourage free water drinking/hydration.
.
Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia: unclear etiology, perhaps due to
alcohol or renal disease. Started daily PO potassium and daily
PO magnesium, with regular electrolyte checks. Again, please
follow-up on renin and aldosterone level tests on this patient,
sent out from UPMCE laboratory.
.
Hypocalcemia - Pt had transient hypocalcemia raising question of
hypoPTH or pseudohypoPTH, however PTH level wnl and hypocalcemia
resolved with re123 Any St.n.
.

Discharge Condition:
Afebrile, diarrhea resolved, creatinine improved, knee pain at
baseline, ambulating with assistance and walker. Feels eager to
leave hospital.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea due to a
bacteria called c.difficile. Because of the dehydration due to
the diarrhea, your kidneys were injured. As we rehydrated you,
and treated your diarrhea with an antibiotic called vanocmycin,
your diarrhea went away and your kidney function improved back
to approximately your baseline. We continued you on the
antibiotics you were on for your right knee infection
(fluconazole) - the infectious disease team saw you and
recommended that you continue on that antibiotic for between
6-12 months; they will explain the specific course to you when
you go to your next appointment with them. For your knee pain,
physical therapy saw you and recommended that you go to rehab.
Your breathing was initially dificult so you were on oxygen, but
as that improved you were weaned down to room air. Your
potassium and magnesium levels were frequently found to be low,
so we started you on pills for those. Your sodium was frequently
high, so we encourage you to drink water to stay hydrated.
.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop
a fever >100.4, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
re--occurrence of diarrhea, worsening right knee pain, or other
symptoms that concern you.
.
Please continue the oral fluconazole antibiotic (to treat your
knee infection) daily until you see the infectious disease
doctor, Dr. Gill, and then you will still continue that
medicine for 6-12 months.
.
Please continue to avoid drinking alcohol.
.
We have changed your blood pressure medication regimen so that
now you are taking the following medications:
-clonidine
-amlodipine
-toprol XL
