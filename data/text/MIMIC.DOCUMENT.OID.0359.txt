Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M with PMH of CVA, Afib, CRI p/w confusion/agitation,
nausea, weakness, and acute on chronic renal failure.  Admitted
for acute dialysis and work up of confusion.  Hospital course
complicated by two episodes of aspiration pneumonia
necessitating ICU admission and a left frontal-parietal stroke
resulting in right hemiparesis and persitant delerium.  He was
noted to be hypercalcemic with elevated 1,25-vit D levels and
associated with a new renal mass and enlarged spleen.  This was
felt to be related to a paraneoplastic syndrome likely from a
lymphoma with renal and s123 Any St. involvement.  On his second ICU
transfer the patient remained pressor dependent despite
treatment with antibiotics and stress dose steroids.  Given his
overall poor prognosis for meaningful recovery, his family
decided to withdrawl care.  The patient was maintained on
minimal sedation while pressors were stopped and he was
extubated.  He passed away within minutes of stopping his
vasopressors.
