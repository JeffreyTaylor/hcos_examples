Attending:Alaiza Schoellman
Chief Complaint:
Colitis with bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Colectomy


History of Present Illness:
49 yo female who has had blood loss over a period of several
months and has had abnormal colonoscopies which have shown some
areas of stricturing. This has been unusual but is thought most
likely to be due to Crohn's disease. She has
been on steroids but still with problems. She presents now with
a hematocrit of 20. She is a Jehovah's witness and will not
accept any blood transfusions. After consultation with her
General Medical physician and also with the hematology service,
it was thought that it would not be possible to increase her
hematocrit significantly prior to operation without at least a 1
month delay. It was also thought likely that any improvement in
iron therapy would be off-set by continued bleeding. The patient
and her partner understand the gravity of this situation and the
need for operation under less than optimum circumstances. The
patient has again expressed her wish that she not be given blood
products, but she would accept certain other types of fluid. She
presents
now for right colectomy.
